Mr. Sabbarwal, we've found patient's case history. And, we've started the process immediately. Doctor, please! I will try my best Mr. Sabbarwal. Keep faith, everything will be fine. Yes Jatin.. Did you reach the hospital? Yes, just now. What are the doctors saying? They've begun with their process. I hope everything goes well. Anyway let's meet and talk further. I'll be there in 20minutes. What! Are you crazy? There's no need of you to come here. Swati, my name is printed as a chief guest on the invitation. Banners are published, media has featured it, and in such case.. If I don't reach at the book launch it's going to be very bad for your publication's image. Are you sure? Swati! Everything, of a sudden... Jatin, think once again. Yes, I'm coming. I would like to request Mr. Sabbarwal to come here and share his views on the book 'AKS'. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jatin Sabbarwal. Thank you Mr. Dew. I'm overwhelmed to be here. My dad says, it's difficult to find good friends.. ..and it's much difficult to find true friends! Today, we're in the net age. Today we're equipped with infinite sources of contact! Visit the internet and any social networking site and you can make many friends! In short, today the easiest thing is to make friends. But, what dad says is as important to me even today. That one true friend is, was and will always be easily available. Books! Books, they eradicate our loneliness and sometimes also guide us. They help us from committing any wrong and sometimes inspire us to be right! A complete true friend. Books! I convey warm regards to Panchi, the writer of this novel. I hope this novel will help us reflect our real selves. So, let's read few lines of it and know it better. I am a bird, beginning with small take offs. In search of something while I fly, I am a Bird! A bird who will tell you a strange story about the destiny. A story that tells how this bird cuts off her wings by herself. A bird, who shows the unlike reflection of circumstances. I am bird, telling story of a bird! I am a Bird... Jatin! Jatin, what happened? What happened? I want to meet Panchi, right now! Where can I find her? What's her address? But what's the matter Jatin? Of a sudden you're like... Swati please! I don't have time to explain you everything, I want to meet Panchi. Where can I find her? What's her address I don't know! What you mean you don't know? She's your writer, you have published her book! You must have met her, spoken to her, also must have signed a contract.. ..and many other legal formalities must have been performed. Definitely you should have her name, number, address, something! We do not have it! What do you mean you don't have it? We don't have any details of her neither anybody knows Panchi. We received this script of the book 'AKS' as a courier. Our creative department is been handled by Mr. Dibakar. He found it interesting and is the one who decided to publish it as a book. In fact, Even I  haven't read this book until now. I want to meet Mr. Dibakar, right now. Ma'am, writer Panchi just has a sole post box number. Other official formalities have been performed through this post box number. I need that post box number. Yes ma'am. 19567. This post box number number belongs to Mumbai, near some area known as Laxmi nagar. Jatin, wait! Thank you. Okay. We're friends and considering the same I at least hold a right to know.. ..how do you know Panchi? Why are you so eager to meet her? Why are you behaving so mysterious about her? Swati, read this book. You'll find answers for all your questions in this. Yes Dad! Jatin, where are you? Dad, I'm here at... You should be here at the moment. Okay Dad, I'm coming. Dedicated to my beloved Rabbit. I remember, he said it once, 'Life changes every moment'. And, every moment has an ability to change everything! But may be he was unaware, that, destiny is something between past and future. Fate reveals it's decision during this moment! For us, it was decided by our fate quite soon! That fine day, at Himachal's Police station, destiny knocked in for the first time! This age and moreover this tyranny! That almighty behaves so disheartening at times. Why did you come here? I've come here to file a report. You can talk! Yes, definitely! I can talk. Also, you can hear. Very well! So why were you talking in gestures like a dumb and deaf? Because you were talking in gestures so I thought that you're... That I'm deaf! Pal, I was eating a paan. Which shouldn't be in an on duty police officer's mouth.. ..when you're on duty while talking to public, right? Police officer, Manoj Kumar. You've to file a report regarding what? Sir, actually... Tell me. Sir, I've lost my camera. So, you're a photographer? No sir, I'm a student of law, I'm just fond Photography. Thought, will visit a beautiful place, but sir.. ..I wasn't aware, even Himachal isn't safe like other places. Who said this? Himachal is safe! and your camera is lost and isn't robbed. Sir, what's the guarantee? it's possible that someone must have robbed it. That's not possible. That's not possible. In our city we treat our guests as god. So, god's belongings are robbed like this? No, nothing like this, you'll get your belonging back. Tell me the name. Canon DSLR Huh? C A NON  DS LR. You have a really different name. Sir, this isn't my name. It's camera's name. I asked your name. Sir, so say like that. Jatin Sabbarwal. Give me complete details. Where, when and why did you go? Tell me everything. Sir... - Wait for a moment, you made me spit the paan. Dara, hey Dara. where does he go! You stay here. I'll come in 2 minutes, some important work. Dara, hey Dara... Hello, listen... Oh no! What happened? Everything's alright? I received your message at the hotel that you're here. But what are you doing here? Hello! I'm talking to you? Hey, Gullu, what happened? What are you doing here? Where? Here, at the park! Pal, I mean here at the police station? Actually pal, I'd come here to file a report. Report, about what? My camera is misplaced. When? Yesterday. You lost the camera yesterday and you're telling me this now! So when should I tell you? Do you have any spare time left apart from boozing? Yes, but I've come here to have fun and boozing comes under having fun. That's why! Hey pal, I don't want to click those wild animals as you do. You just can't! Come on, come. What are you doing? listen to me. Come with me. Listen... What are you doing? Hey, camera! - What? My camera. But you told me your camera is... Hey, you're here and I'm searching for you inside. You're weird. Sir, I found my camera. Right here, on this table. A girl had come here to return this camera, she found it at Chamera lake. Yes, I'd visited there yesterday. I'd told you,.. ..that, you will get your camera back, that too misplaced and not robbed. Ma'am, that girl, who was she? Who knows who is she, she came over, returned the camera and left. Yes, that's fine but you would've asked  her name, address, something. She'd come here just to return the camera, she wasn't a thief! Correct! hey you found your camera, now let's go. Thank you! Hey, she has returned my camera so at least she is worth a Thank you. Shut up! Say thank you us, when we happen to meet her, we'll pass it on. Right Kumari? Yes sir. Yes, that's absolutely correct. Absolutely! Thank you giving Himachal police an opportunity to serve you. Hello! - Hello, Jatin where are you? I'm trying your phone since long. Listen, our flight is in Sometime. Come soon. Hello, Jatin. Yes, I'm coming. Hey, Dew! Congratulations Sabbarwal. Namaste sister-in-law! Namaste. How are you? I'm fine. So there's this another sixer! You've won this case also. To be honest, I wasn't too sure this time. A very important case and everyone had their attention to it. But he did it. I'm really happy and proud. Most lucky of all are his clients as they appoint an advocate like him. There are two kinds of advocates. One who knows the law. - And other? Who knows the judge! Can't see Swati around. She must be on her way. One more. Gullu, enough, or else you'll burst. Look, drink until you burst and live until you burst. And then live until you burst and drink until you burst. Why are you bothered? Your father hasn't sponsored this. My father has sponsored it. Is it! Look, your father is like my father. So then if my father has sponsored this why are you bothered? Hi Jatin! Hey! Swati. When did you come back? Last night from America and few minutes ago in the party. Give me a hug, Hi. Hi fatso. Hi. Let's go and talk upstairs. Cheers! Hey, change the glass. Our kids have grown up now! Need to think about them. I missed you! Two friends and both of them of no use. One, went America and other, "Drink until you burst and live until you burst". With whom should I share my feelings? Why? isn't there anyone special in your life to share your feelings? May be not yet. No! Because, just tell right away if there's someone.. ..as our Parents are trying to fix our alliance. No! Well, it was my duty to warn you! Hey, just deny it. If you have any problem you deny for it. It means, you have no problem with it? No! They're our Parents. They will definitely think of our good. Anyways, I'm a pure Indian cultured girl. Parent's decision is god's decision. Wooah! Ideal woman. Listen, I've to complete my Law studies and you've to complete your course. Don't drag me into all this. So go! Go and file a case against your Parents, protest and fight for your right. May be you'll win it. What happened? It tastes weird. Really? Vodka exactly tastes this. Jatin! Congrats Dad! Thanks! You know son Yes. I was 25 years old. Yes. When I saw your mom for the first time! She was shopping at a shop. There were butterflies in my stomach the moment I saw her. I approached her the same moment, and you know what I did? I proposed her to marry me. What! -Yes. Not only this, I caught hold of her hand. wow, directly?! Directly. Dad, what happened next? Son, what happened next was something strange! I held her hand in mine and we were lost into each other. It was hard to distinguish our intertwine fingers. I said to her, 'There's a beautiful moon up high in the sky and other at my eyesight'! Will you marry me? That's it! Wow dad! It's a bit filmy, right? Yes, it is a bit filmy. Wow! But dad, looking at you it doesn't seem you can be this romantic. Hey! shall I punch you one. Dad, it's very unfair. You have a great loves story but trying to couple me with Swati! Don't do this, I mean I never thought of her like girl of my life! Dear, it's not me but your mom who's trying to couple you with her. She is the one after you to get married. Anyways, you need not worry. Enjoy your time and think of marrying anytime later you wish to. Thank you Dad! Listen to me. Minister is heading here. Will you both stay here all night long. Finish it up and go to sleep. Home minister, we'll be there in sometime. No, now, right now! My dear dictator let me at least finish the glass. I said, right now! Okay my son. Listen to me, it's Mr. Mehta's case hearing tomorrow so accompany me. Okay, good night! Good night dad. As time would've passed, Himachal's meet might have been like a beautiful memory for him. until the destiny wouldn't have plans for us to come across again! Until the day he wouldn't have seen me once again. Hey Gullu where are you? It's been an hour I'm waiting for you. Come soon... Yes, it's okay. We met; we met once again! But both of us never thought we would meet up this way! Hi! Brother, can you just pass on that I want to meet that girl in orange. Brother, just pass on ahead he wants to meet that girl in orange. He wants to meet. He wants to meet. Wants to meet. Wants to meet. He wants to meet. Wants to meet. What happened? Wants to meet. Wants to meet. He's calling you. Let him go to hell! Pen? Hey brother, you should have Seen the print! Take this paper. Just write there, to stay away from me. Will you like enjoy a slap? Please stop the bus. What? what's your problem? Why are you after me? I had to talk to you. What do you mean? There in Himachal... Himachal, what? My camera! What camera? You'd returned my camera there at the police station. So? I got my camera back because of you. So! I wanted to say thank you to you. You mean to say you came all the way from Himachal to Mumbai to say thank you? No, no, I stay here in Mumbai at Juhu. I'm waiting. Waiting for what? For you to say thank you, what else? Thank you! You're done with your thank you? So now there's no need of you to follow me, correct! So I'll go my way and you should go yours! Let's go. Please listen to me. Listen please... Auto... I'd clicked some pictures of you at Himachal, they're are beautiful, would you like to see? You're trying a wrong number! you'll just waste your time on me. Try these kiddish ways with someone else, probably you might get some girl. You get that! Hey wait! Don't come after me henceforth. Barkhaa let's go. Barkhaa, come let's go. Stupid! Barkhaa! So, you met this girl at Himachal's police station for the first time. In fact you didn't even meet her but just had a glimpse. Yes. Second time, you saw her at the market place. Where you again had a glimpse of her. Yes. Third time, you met her here at Mumbai. Where you both saw each other and she asked you to never try to see her. Tell me, did she say this? Yes, she said this. So? I mean so much has happened and you didn't tell me. What I should have told you? Even I'm unable to understand what's happening. In fact, I'm still unable to understand what's all happening with me? When I saw her at Himachal's police station for the first time, that moment something happened! Something, something weird something like... Just happened! I just know that my heartbeats could echo in my ears. I kept looking at her and felt like not to stop... And the moment she left, everything was finished! I'll tell you something? I've just seen all this happening in movies, that a boy has a glimpse of a girl for the first time and that's it! He falls in love with her. But pal, this is actually happening with you. Your brains stops functioning when your heart falls in love. That's fine but what will you Do now? How will you find her? Her friend referred her as Barkhaa! So? So, let's search. Dad! Yes dad. Where are you son? Dad, I'm here at the office flat. Dear, Aazam uncle's friend Mr. Shetty is messed up in a property case. I want you to reach Commissioner’s office immediately and solve this problem. Sure dad. Stay rest assured, your file has been sent to the right person. As well I've personally taken care of it. Now, there's no need to worry, your job will be done. Thank you! - There's no need for a thank you. I can do anything for Mr. Sabbarwal. And, when will you fix the meeting with the Commissioner? Don't take tension about the meeting. He is out for half an hour for lunch. As soon he returns, your meeting is done. It will be done. Uh, Beer? Coffee. Dude, I've never seen a bore like you. Barkhaa! Barkhaa, Barkhaa, Barkhaa... That's too much for now, let's go. Mr. Shetty Yes. Your problem has been resolved. Take this, all the NOCs of your business. Thank you sir. I was sure you will resolve my problem but this soon... Thank you sir. Sir, your fees. That's not needed! Your friend Mr. Azam on who's recommendation I accepted this case, is a good friend of mine as well. Please don't bother. But sir, fees... Just let it be. Excuse me. Sir... Hello! Yes, yes, yes. I'll take care of it sir, please don't worry. But fees... Sir, even you helped, right? Then, fees is a must. No sir, sir keep it with you. Trust me, there's no need. Dad told you, right! More than enough. Okay, not fees but you have to agree on one thing, please don't deny. No, no, sure! Hey pal, what's this? Where did you bring me? This is brother's bar. Actually, we did not charge him with the fee. So, he wants us to visit his bar for 10 minutes and give him the honor to be thankful to us. He will feel relieved. Gullu you know I don't like... You don't like it, I know! So, we ain't going to spend a holiday here! We'll go there for 10-15 minutes, enjoy 1 beer and leave. If dad comes to know this, you know it well. How will uncle come to know about it as if we're giving a breaking news on a national TV channel. No, right? Come on pal, let's go. Please leave all this, come on. Come with me please. Yes, coming. Go ahead. Sorry sir, you cannot go inside. Cannot go inside, why? There's a private party going on inside. Private party will be for us, because we... He? But, brother had invited us. Sir, you won't be allowed. Sorry! Gullu, let's leave. He said it's closed, come. What let's leave. Wait for a minute. Cannot go inside! Brother, what is this? We're outside your bar but the guard isn't allowing us inside. He's saying some private party is going on. Look at this, Junior Sabbarwal got annoyed and left. Please come soon. Hey Jatin! please wait. Don't get annoyed, please wait. See, even brother's here. Oh sorry, sorry, really sorry. These are donkeys! He couldn't recognize my special guests. Please come in. Brother, I'm not leaving because of him. Be it any reason but please come in once, I insist. Sorry, sorry! Please give me a chance to thank you. Come in. Correct! let's go. Hey you, I'd told you my friends will come over a special guests! In spite of that you blocked them out! Sorry brother. You, what to say now. Be careful henceforth. Please come. Let's go. I'm on leave tomorrow onwards. Really. Gullu, let's leave from here. Pal, come on! Please come in, have a seat. Brother, your bar is lovely! Almighty's blessings. Brother, dance bars were banned, right? So then? Dance is banned in the bar, not the stomach's hunger. And which law takes into consideration the hunger? And what about the police men out? This is fun of law and order. What do you mean? Means, they have an order to keep a check if there's dance going on. Now-a-days this is important to them rather to have a single men where it's truly required. Do you see any police men outside an ATM? - No. Outside a bank, jewelery shop, housing society? but in a dance bar a police man has to be there! - Yes, right. Security purpose. Leave all this. Hey listen, is there someone out? Coming sir. Tell me sir, what will you have? Beer, rum, whiskey, vodka? No, I won't have anything. Thank you. Nothing, no sir. Please have something. Sir, really I... Correct! If you don't drink anything after coming in a bar, that's an insult for a bar. Brother, I'll opt for a beer. Very good and what about you? I won't have anything. No, no, even he'll take a beer. Very good! Get 2 chilled beer. Let's go. Brother, can we go and sit downstairs at the floor? Actually, I'm unable to get that feel here. Sir, you can sit wherever you like. Bar's yours, brother's yours! Gullu, let's go from here. Hey, please wait. One more! Gullu, I'm leaving okay! Please wait, we'll go. I'm going. Hey, wait. Did you see him? Whom? Who else, your rabbit! He was awestruck to see me here! My dear, this truth is really harsh. Great masters can't take it what to say about this lad! Let it be. Come on, shut it down right away. Yes. Quick, shut down. If Tawde sir gets angry everything will turn into a mess. Check the time! - Yes. It's 1.30 am. Shut down right away. - Yes sir, 2 minutes we're doing it. Don't you understand! you think I'm crazy? know the seriousness! Come on, shut it quickly. You'll, make it quick, cops are creating a havoc outside. Come on, quick! Come on. Barkhaa. What? You felt bad, right? that your rabbit saw you here. I don't feel anything now. Let's go to the airport. Jatin... Please, forget her! These bar girls belong to no one. One who goes after them gets completely destroyed. Look, stay away from all this. Brother, why so less girls today? It's risky to keep girls on the floor today. Media and tipper of police have created a lot of tension! We have to keep catering to the extortion! Regardless your business flourishes or goes in a dump. It's less for them, may how big the amount is. So, this is the reason other girls are out in the car. As soon the particular female's guest is here, we'll get one out from here and her inside. You continue to drink, the one you like is coming in. What are you doing here? What are you up to? Come on, get up. Get up! Come here, I'd asked you to stay away from her, right? Do you have any clue about what are you doing! You're heading towards the hell! Your present, future everything will be at a stake because of her. Think about your self esteem, think about your father's reputation. Think of something! These bar girls keep guys like you on their finger tips! Did you get it? It isn't any kind of love! It's just her mere body attracting you. Why don't you understand? The path you're heading to will destroy you and nothing else. I can understand this simple thing then why don't you? Jatin! Vinita, where's Jatin? Upstairs in his room. Jatin Good morning dad. I heard you arrived home late in the night, even yesterday. And that you stay at the office flat most of the time. Son, is everything okay? Yes dad. Okay, see you at the office in the afternoon. Hey, how long will you take? get it quickly. Mr. Mehta, this song is dedicated to you! The one who is sitting there, tell him Barkhaa has called him. You've been called. What? Barkhaa has called you in. Why? I don't know. Please come in. Oh my my! Come here, sit. What? I'm observing this since many days! You come here, sit in a corner and order a drink, keeps staring at me, gathers the collection, and then you pay the bill without drinking and leave. Why? You should come ahead and sit! When you spend so much, enjoy the worth it! right? What's your name? Jatin. What do you do? I mean your what's source of income? I'm studying law. What's law? Advocacy! That's nice, you're an advocate? Not yet an advocate. When you're studying advocacy definitely you'll be an advocate soon! Look, I asked you to come here to tell you that you shouldn't be cornered like a thief, you must sit ahead. You and me; both of us happy, right? Why? What you mean by why? It's my wish, I'll sit anywhere I want to. What difference does it make to you? It does make a difference. Everyone here knows, you're crazy for me and come here to see me. So then, you shouldn't sit crouched in a corner like a rabbit. She has named you, Rabbit! Hey... Listen... Why did you make fun of him? Anyone who comes here, eventually creates a mockery of himself! Look, I think he really loves you Barkhaa. My dear, a man just wants one thing! May he begins anyhow, he reaches to the same thing. A woman sleeps with a man for love and a man loves a woman to sleep with her! It's nothing like this. Barkhaa, even I've experienced things in life I can read the real emotions in eyes. Didn't you see the way he was looking at you, with full of love in his eyes. Now, it makes no sense whether he looks with love or lust! I don't care and I'm just concerned with my need and that is money! Money is everything now! Everything else is worthless! Get up, let's go on the floor. Namaste brother. Hey, Mr. Perfect, Namaste. How are you? I'm doing great. Brother, I need to talk to you. Sure, please have a seat. Tell me. Brother, my friend Jatin, he has fallen for a girl here. Barkhaa! Brother if you don't mind, With my friend, will she be ready to... one night Barkhaa would?? I hope you understand me? With her will and wish! only if she wants to. There's no force. And, money is not an issue! You and your friend helped me. Without charging any fee. With complete generosity. That's why even I totally respected it. Same here brother! But now, listen to me. Listen to me carefully and understand. Yes. Firstly, I run a bar and not bawdy house. Brother, I didn't mean this. Secondly, I know what image bar dancers have out in people's view. Everybody thinks any and every girl who's a bar dancer is a whore! Is ready sell off herself and can sleep with anyone for money! But that's not the way it is. Helplessness makes one do many things, depends on good and bad times. They're definitely in this market but definitely not a pick up girl! And, as much I know Barkhaa she would never do this, never sell herself! To be honest, if anyone else might have said this he wouldn't have moved out from here on his feet. Actually I... Thank you. Okay. This is nice, god knows when will my lover will turn up! Hema, Reena, Kavita, don't you'll want to go on the floor? Hey hero, when will you send me? That oldie is waiting for me out! If anything happens to him there the loss would be mine, no money! Anyways there's a great risk! Those cops can come down anytime in these 2 hours and stop everything! Varsha, why do you take so much of tension? Brother has full setting with these cops. You'll be safe, I can guarantee you. How? setting was there earlier also, right! Yes, it was there. Don't you remember about the raid in the previous month? This Hema, Reena, Hirni all were in the jail for a week. Yes, but it was brother who got them out on bail. This happens at times. Anyways, I'll call you in sometime. You'll make it quick, go out. Barkhaa... Yes. Your rabbit turned out to be very cunning! Why? what happened? That fatso, who used to accompany him he was trying to do some setting with brother to make you spend a night with that rabbit. Hey what happened? Sir, I don't know what happened. What are you playing! play my song. Yes sir, I'll play it. How much can you pay? What? How much can you pay me for sleeping with me? I didn't get you. Why? What happened? This is what you wanted. This is why yo were doing all this. This is why you were pretending things since many days! Now what happened? speak up. Why don't you say anything now! Who told you that I... Hey! don't try to pretend things after me. Trying to act innocent. Who sent that fatso to talk to brother? To finalize the rate for me to spend a night with you. You should have come directly. Should have directly told me that you want to sleep with me! You have no courage. No one's different! Everyone has this one intention. What did you think? I dance here this means I'm a whore! I sweat blood over every step spending 2 hours and more dancing on the floor. Every time the money is thrown at time, my respect is thrown down too. Everyday I'm being raped by these dirty hungry eyes! It's then that I earn money. My bread and butter comes with my hard earned money. Did you get that? Get up, get up! Hey! Hey... Who asked you? Who asked you? Why are you hitting me? Who asked you to go to brother and talk this cheap thing? Look, I thought... What did you think? Hey, I thought if you get her once you will get rid off the craze of love. Moreover, I also tried to make you understand. Don't make me understand, just don't! You understand; you understand it very well. I love her. I love her a lot! Why can't you get this simple thing in your mind! How should I make you understand? What should I do? Neither she is ready to understand nor you! Don't complicate my problems. Stay away from me. But Jatin... Leave me lone. Actually, I'd called up brother and he told me you're here. In fact, it's good. As, what I want to say there won't be any better place than this. Barkhaa, the thing about spending a night with you Jatin has no fault in it, it's my mistake. Why are you telling me all this? So that you shouldn't misunderstand Jatin in any ways. What's the need of me to understand him? It's said no one goes disheartened from here! He keeps talking to your photos all day long. Those talks which he actually cannot converse with you. He's in nostalgia with your memories crying and craving you the whole day and keeps waiting to see a glimpse of you at night! Wait for a minute. Do you recognize this? This is your handkerchief. This fell down while you were getting in the bus in Himachal. And this, even this is yours. He has kept it with such a care as if anyone takes care of valuable belongings. Barkhaa, it really doesn't matter to him who you are, your background, Barkhaa, he loves you a lot. I want to meet Jatin, right now. Uh, Jatin Dad, just a second. Hello, hold for a second. Yes dad. Son, you reach office and I'll come after visiting Commissioner’s office. Okay dad. Okay? - Yes. Yes, tell me. I'm trying to call you since long! Look, I've cleared the mess and now there's no problem. Now, what did you Gullu? Leave all that, listen to me carefully. Barkhaa wants to meet you. Sometimes even the truth to fight to prove it's existence. As Jatin's truth had to fight! Today, there was a truth that no one could deny, not even me. Jatin's truth, his truth of the true love for me. And now, it was time to know other side of the coin! my truth. And, I'd now decided to tell him the same. Hey sweetheart! You'll make your darling lose today if this keeps happening. Some other girl will become a bar queen! Your darling will be insulted before everyone! Bar queen means? It's Happy new year today! So? So, the girl who is showered with most money today everyone considers her as a bar queen. But, until there's my king here, no other girl can be the bar queen. Yes, of course! It's you who will be the bar queen. Really! I'm there, why do you worry. Sajan, go and call the manager. Tell him Sawant sir has called him. Today, I'll shower my darling with so much of money that the complete floor will burst. Tomorrow, I want to say something to you. Something special! What? Not today, tomorrow. Dear, your philanderer was just amazing. He made you the queen for this year. And the one after me, frog! Just kept giving me the jazz, such a jerk. Hello. Dear Barkhaa. Aunty! how are you? Dear, I needed some money. Aunty, I'll send the money. Get everything you require. Also, Gopal was saying he wants a bike! - Yes. Ask him to buy it immediately tomorrow. Who else is there for me apart from you! My sweet daughter. Why do you worry, this time lord laxmi has showered all her blessings on me. Yes Aunty. Give me some water. Brother, Kavita had called and told me she won't come today Says, she is going for dinner with her biker guy, the one with candles. But not just her, other girls too are doing the something similar. They've earned fat on the new year night! So, they're spending. Make understand these stupid girls to save up the money or else they'll have to start begging. Look at this, court's final notice. Within a week Mumbai's all dance bars should be shut down. What will they do later? Where to go? What will they earn? Thousands of families run because of this business. Within a moment all of them will be destroyed. But no one cares! But why brother? Bars are working since years, nothing ever happened. Then of a sudden what is this? There's not one thing to tell you, there are hell lot a things going on. Dance bars are not sufficient to some people. So, service bars, pick up point, every thing is going on under the tag of dance bars. And, minister Waghmare! Some nephew of his, fell for a bar girl. That's it, minister's temper got high and announced to shut all the dance bars. He says, people come here and get ruined and destroyed! They sell off our their homes and property. Such a jerk. Tell me something, one who wants to sell off he can also sell it off at a gambling spot and for alcohol! Yes, he will. - What's the need to come here at a dance bar! Yes, that's correct! Aakash. This Auto rickshaw driver, he takes so long. See, here's the king! What's this uncle? you're late again. - Sorry ma'am. The only English word you've learnt in your lifetime, you'd use with me. Let's go. Now what's wrong with her? Barkhaa, let's go. Aakash, where are we? Take it easy dear. I did not elope you, right? And, some things are said and done at their right place! Come. I couldn't say anything to you as I was awaiting for this particular day. I thought, I should say it you at the right time and right place. I love you Barkhaa. Since the day I saw you for the first time. Since that day I decided to live my life with you. I've created this small world for us. Only we will be there and no one else. This doesn't mean you think the same for me as I do. I love you and that's sufficient for me. I can't see you being treated as an exhibition at the bar. Barkhaa, I want to spent my whole life with you. Needs and requirements of the family got me to Mumbai from Himachal. I didn't get a job anywhere. Wherever I approached, just saw dirty eyes trying to peep within my clothes! Then, someone got me a job at the dance bar. I thought, when I've bear those dirty eyes everywhere so what's bad in this bar, at least I'll be paid for this. Like every other girl, even I had a dream that someone will love me more than myself! May be you're the one I was awaiting for. I had a lot of complains with my destiny. But, I had no idea that my destiny will bless me like this. I don't know Aakash am I even worth it! But I'll try my best to make myself worth your love. I'm thankful to you for giving me a place in your heart and your dreams. What! did you tell Aakash? He's in Pune, as soon he comes I'll tell him. Which month is going on? Third month. Ask her is it a girl or a boy? Hey, stupid! how will she know is it a girl or a boy! Baby isn't born with a voting card. Mad! I know that, I just meant what does she wish, a boy or a girl? Anyone, it's Barkhaa's right! Is it Barkhaa's phone? -Yes, brother. Barkhaa, how are you? Brother! She will be happy, obviously. She is going to be a mother. That's true. Brother, wish you a Happy birthday! You remembered it's my birthday today. How can I forget your birthday brother! Also today it's dad's birthday. I lost him in the childhood but always saw him in you. How can Barkhaa forget my dad's birthday. Please take care. Why didn't you tell us prior that it's brother's birthday today. Anyways, it's good for we all. You'll be a mother and brother's birthday, 1 on 1 free treat. Party for all of us. Yaay! What are you saying! Yes and look, my new phone. Show me. Uh! You're stubborn, won't change. I'd told you, you must take care and stay home in this condition. But, you'd recently purchased a phone, right? Yes. Even this seems expensive. You know how to use it? Where do I even know to dance? Still I manage, right? I'll manage with this as well. That uncle, clothes shop! Tells me, Madhu your phone is too busy now-a-days when contacted. Take this, new number and new phone. I'll have big conversations with you all night. She is so notorious! Madhu! Come on, come on, come on! It's birthday. We'll cut brother's cake. This wasn't needed. I'll get cold drinks for all. You're like... Stop, stop everything! No one will move from their places! Don't move, don't move. Sit down where you're! No one will move. Take him aside, take all of them aside. Brother, brother it's police, police... Come on, leave. Barkhaa you leave. Everyone move out, come on quickly. Quick, quick, move, quick! Madhu! Get up, let's go. Run! Hey, wait. What I was saying is... Sir. Sir, please leave her. What? Sir, she doesn't belong with us. She'd just come to meet us. She doesn't belong to you all! Since 5 years she's dancing here and you say she's not from this bar. You think I'm a jerk! No sir, she was a dancer here but not now, she has left this line. Oh, is that so. She got married and settled now. She was here to just meet us on my birthday. Wow, brother, you didn't tell us it's your birthday. Instead of today, we would've arranged the raid for tomorrow. For no reason your birthday is ruined. Let's go, we'll celebrate your birthday at the police station. Tawde, right? Yes sir, definitely. He's like a family. Listen, brother, cake from our side, alright. Sir, I'll come, please leave her. Brother, don't frustrate me, come on. Tawde, close it. Sir, please leave her, please! Walk straight, go ahead. What I was saying... Shut up and move, come on. Why did you come? I've committed a mistake sir, I won't repeat it. Please let me go. Hey! Are you married? I beg your pardon. Are you married? Yes sir, I am. Wife at home and you at the bar! For what kind of were you there for! Sir, a married man has a miserable life. What? Sir, I mean, I mean... After marriage a man turns into an ATM machine. Here's comes the command and here the withdrawal. Sir, even I'm a human, right? Last year I took her to Manali for vacations, she said wants to go Goa! When I took her to Goa, she says let's go to Bhopal. As soon I enter the house, she starts whining! I'm aware, a bar girl has everything fake in her. Her dance, smile, every little thing but, the moment she comes close and says, How are you? It feels good! Sir, should I leave? You're trying to act too smart! What about you? You're too fed up with your wife's whining that made you sit in a bar? Sir, I'm not yet married. So, why did you go there? This is the reason I'd gone there. My goodness. Sir, shall we go now? You're lucky that it was me on the duty. Get lost from here, come on move. Sir, I... Sir... Sir, let her go please. Sir, you and me will take care of everything else here, please. Sir, your wish will be my command. I'm running a bar since years, I never gave any officer an opportunity to complain. Sir, please let her go. Everyone else is here. No brother, I cannot do that. Try to understand! Look, you and Sawant sir had a good setting so we just pretended to put the raid at your bar. But, did we ever put in a big loss? No, right? Did we ever catch hold of Anyone? No! Did we ever file a case against you? No! am I right? Brother, try to understand the seriousness. This has big names involved in doing this. Ministers are the culprit? Elections are on the verge. This drama is just to pull people's attention and distract them. In real they're not interested to do anything substantial for people. They just keep doing drama! And, you're aware about everything. Listen to me. They're using social service teams as weapons against you and me. Brother, things are not in my control. I'm helpless. But, in spite of that I can leave your staff somehow but, none girl! Sir... No! These morons have made a list stating each girl's name in your bar. Even if a single girl is left Scot free, my job is in trouble. Sir, there will be some way out! Sir, please do something. Just let her go and nothing else. I'll be grateful to you all my life. I beg of you. So, you've left this work, right? Yes. How long it's been? 6 months. What do you do now? I just stay home now. Kept on salary basis? I'm his wife. Wife! So, finally you trapped someone! Very good! What does your husband do? Hey, I'm asking you! I don't know. It's your husband or your neighbor’s? I don't know what he does. Bhagve sir! - Yes. Did you listen to this? These people say that she's innocent and got caught by fluke. But she doesn't even know what's her husband's profession. Really! Everything's a drama. In real there's no husband so how will she know it what does he do. I'm aware of these whores very well! They pretend to be sober when caught whereas they get sold off just like this! Sir, don't refer me a whore! What did you say? Don't refer me a whore! I was a bar dancer, I used to dance and not do what a whore does. What's a difference between a whore and a bar dancer? The same difference that's between your wife and a housekeeping maid. One's in bed with you at night and other, makes up the same bed in the morning. Both do their respective jobs and do not behave as a whore. Hey you! This mere bar dancer has guts to talk about my wife! Sir, even I'm someone's wife. He's a reputed man. If you would've said this in his presence he would smash you here. If so, call him here right away. Ask him to come here and talk to me. I won't spare you now and make sure you're behind the bars all your life. Ma'am, dial the number. Tell me. His name is Aakash. Hello. Aakash? Yes, speaking, who is this? I'm head constable Anjali Lambole here. Okay, I'm listening. We had a raid at an orchestra bar. During which we caught hold of some girls dancing and in compromising condition and out of which there's a girl... Her name is... Hey, what's your name? Barkhaa. Barkhaa! Barkhaa! You will have to visit the police station for her identification. No, I don't know any girl with this name. What are you saying! You're her husband, right? Husband! what nonsense. Nonsense! But she says you're her husband. I'm still single. Single! What are you saying? I don't know even a normal girl with the name Barkhaa. And moreover she is a bar girl. I'm sure it's just some big misunderstanding! But what says is this. Ma'am, let her say what she wants to! But she is repeating the same thing. That doesn't make a difference. I just don't know this girl. Yes, this girl, what did you tell me her name? Barkhaa. Barkhaa must have got my number from somewhere and now she is misusing it to get Scot-free. Hey! What did you say? You don't know Barkhaa! Now, who is this? Your mother, you jerk! Who was the one, who used to sit at the bar for hours staring at her. Also, the one who showed her dreams about marriage and took her to the flat and had fun! Kept her like a wife. Now, when it's time come forward to face the world you're backing off! I never had trust on him! Now, I'm hanging up the phone. Just hang up and I'll show you jerk! I'll come there and smash your body and shred you into pieces! It's known well, to fool around there's none best than a dumb bar girl! It's our mistake, we see dreams! of a home, of a happy married life, of a husband, of having the bread with respect! Make promises, give assurances of making our dreams come true and fulfill your intentions. This what you did with Barkhaa! Also, this fool thought her fate has shined forever! Fate of we bar girls just shines from 11 to 2 in the night! If she might have used her brains instead of getting emotional she would've been away from a rascal like you! She wouldn't have given up everything for you! She wouldn't have been pregnant with your child in her womb! She has conceived! It's been 2 months by now. If you still have some shame and humanity left within you then come and stand by her. I don't know any lady with this name, is that clear! Muma! Muma, have a look at this. Take me closer. Barkhaa, It doesn't matter what's your past. But it does matter how your future should be! Now, the decision is up to you. And, if talking about me I'm an incurable disease you can get rid off only by losing your life! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday... Many happy returns of the day son. God bless you my son. Thanks dad! I was about to come home to meet you all. Really! Liar. Barkhaa. Raju! Take her to the guest room. Yes. Please come. Uncle, it's too late so I should leave. Good night. Jatin, my son... It's not the only question about Sabbarwal family's reputation. It's about you son. Your life, your future! What people will say about this is a later part. But the point is, how will you sustain this relationship? Jatin, she is a mother of 1. Also, look at her profession, where she belongs to, her background. No Jatin, this isn't love but your foolishness. Practically it's not worth! Why don't you understand? I understand mom, I completely understand. I thought you both will understand at least, dad will understand. No problem! I can understand this is so difficult for you both. But muma, please tell me What should I do? I love her, a lot! I cannot live without her. But I love you both a lot too. And dad, may be I'll agree if you deny to this. But dad, what should I do of these breaths? those will completely stop without Barkhaa. Jatin, you are emotionally black mailing us. You... Vinita, one minute. Look, listen to what he's saying, he's gone crazy! Vinita please! Son, if you think what you're doing is right, then okay. But there's one condition! No one in India should come to know about this. I will settle you both at Fiji. Is that okay? Thank you dad. Mom! Thanks dad. What did you say this! How can you do this? Vinita consider this as a stupidity or a foolishness of his age! At this point of time we cannot make him understand. He won't be convinced. Now there's only one who can make him understand. Listen to me, luggage is here. Son, please come soon. Dad, I've just landed. Don't worry dad, now that I'm here I'll take care of it. Waiting for you. See you in a while, bye. Shall we go? -Yes. Come on, let's go. Come on kids. Hello. - Dibakar, I want all the details of writer Panchi. I repeat, complete details. Nothing should be left. Yes ma'am, I'm trying my best. Hey, Sir is here! Ma'am, sir! Brother! Hello Hello. Namaste mother-in-law. God bless you dear. How are you my little brother? I'm fine! come let's go. Brother, you've gained weight! Look dear, this is a sign of a happy family. Mom dad got us married and now we're enjoying! Oh sister-in-law! Brother, have a look she loves me so much! same, same color Oh that's great. Where's dad? He's waiting for you inside. Okay, let's go. I'll get kids. Sure! Kids, come on. Come my kids. How was your trip? It was great. Where's dad? Dad, dad! My dear son, Aakash! Oh dad. How are you son? Good dad. Dad, bless me God bless you dear. Freshen up, we'll talk later. No, not at all mom, I'll get fresh later. First I would like to meet the girl who made my brother spell bound for her. Dad didn't even tell me what's her name. No problem, I'll ask her by myself. -Let's go. Boy, you've grown up! I'm very happy for you. Come. Where is she? Brother, she was here but now may be in mom's room. Okay. I'll just go check Okay. I don't know even a normal girl with the name Barkhaa. And moreover she is a bar girl. A, B, C, D... Neha, get up, Neha, take the kids. Raju, keep the luggage in the car. Dad, I'm sorry I have to go. I have to leave. I'm sorry Dad, I have to leave. Aakash, what happened? Aakash! What has happened Aakash? You'd just arrived and you're leaving. Aakash, son, wait for a while, what has happened dear? Dad I'm really sorry! He is a very important client. It's necessary for me to go. I have to go. Driver, get the car, quick! Aakash what are you doing, how could you just leave like this? Try to understand mom. If it wasn't important would I've left like this! I'll be back soon, getting late for the flight. I'll call you, I'll call you dad. Come on, sit in the car. Dad, what happened? Don't know son, he's leaving. Let's go. Mom, what happened? - I don't know anything what's happening. Our family album. Jatin. I'm coming mom. I don't know any lady with this name, is that clear! That day, I just didn't lose Jatin, but I lost every hope, dream and realization in life. What I would've said to Jatin? What would I've told him? My one truth could have destroyed many lives at a time. I could not do this. Rather than destroying many lives, it was better that I would go away from them. And, that's what I did. That I was all broken inside and shattered. Life just seemed worthless and I wished to die and may be I would actually do that, if I haven't sensed about the innocent life. Where did she vanish? Dad I committed this mistake unknowingly, I'm really very sorry Aakash! Exactly, what was my mistake? Believing a person like Aakash? or accepting Jatin's true love? I think that connecting line between me and god has cut off where he listens to everyone. My voice could never reach him! Or may be he decided to have this as the end of my story. Today, when I turn around to the past everything seems blurred to me. Time has faded all faces to me, they seem as strangers now. But that face; that one face is brightened and clear even today. Within his eyes I'd witnessed true love. My rabbit's face. I know this story incomplete and may be some stories are considered complete by their incompleteness. Everything around cannot always be complete. Also, complete is sometimes left incomplete. Come in. Ma'am these are the details. Thank you. This is a very rare case. I imagine what shock he was suffering that his paralysis couldn't be cured. And now, this severe heart attack! I'm sorry. Jatin, Barkhaa's address is found! I'm... I'm sorry. There's a small village in Himachal, Ratanpura. Bungalow no. 10 This address is been found about Barkhaa. Strange thing is, 'AKS' has been shared with our publication by Madhu and not Barkhaa. When Dibakar spoke to Madhu he learnt that she wished, that world should know about Barkhaa's story. But Barkhaa never wished to do this. However according to Madhu, Even if Barkhaa's truth is revealed it makes no difference. As, her story is left incomplete forever. This means, Barkhaa is no mo... Gullu shut up! You keep speaking nonsense. Barkhaa! This puja is being conducted for offering condolences to Vimla Devi. Muma! You should have told me at least once! No family's reputation can be bigger than a woman's self esteem! And I had told you I'm an incurable disease you can get rid off only by losing your life!
