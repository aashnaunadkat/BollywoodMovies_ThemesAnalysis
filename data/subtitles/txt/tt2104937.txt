What does she has to do with my shoot? Anishka. Shalini Mehra gives us business... ...of 200 Crore rupees every year. We campaign for her 12 products. You got involved in a controversy with her son. Sir, media writes anything. They... Anishka. I'll have to replace you from all my ad campaign. You can not do that. Your agency has a legal contract with me. Mr. Batra, you can't do this to me. I'll drag your agency to court. I won't spare you and that Shalini Mehra. Answer the phone. No use.

There are two problems. Okay. How many days for the days? I think... Be precise. 20 days. From tomorrow. What will be your fees? 20 Lakh rupees. 20 Lakh... ...for 20 days. Per day. It's okay. No problem. I've to get used to it. Anyways, I agree. Often we get oblivious. The heart shouldn't be lost. Who knows when desires will be kindled? Who knows when seasons will change? Hearts knows not how love happens. When eyes are locked... dreams are woven. When someone accompanies us, he seems to be a dear one. When eyes are locked... dreams are woven. When someone accompanies us, he seems to be a dear one. We've reached your house. Thank you for the lift. You're welcome. See you tomorrow. Okay. Anishka, I forgot... This is a gift for you. You got a gift for me. Band aids. You keep needing them. It happens only when you're with me. But I'll keep it. I didn't do anything. I'm fine. When we keep talking of each other... ...the aura is filled with bliss. When you'll be in love, you'll be restless. Who knows when desires will be kindled? Who knows when seasons will change? Hearts knows not how love happens. When eyes are locked... dreams are woven. When someone accompanies us, he seems to be a dear one. He'll come closer one day, believe it. The heart is crazy and unrestrained. Trust it. Who knows when desires will be kindled? Who knows when seasons will change? Hearts knows not how love happens. When eyes are locked... dreams are woven. When someone accompanies us, he seems to be a dear one. Are you fine, Anishka? Be careful! I'm already careful! Did I get astray? I didn't know that... ...I'll enjoy this affair act. I even forgot that there is an end of this drama... But there is a problem. What? I practised with you. Now where can I find a boy like you? Yeah... Anishka. Mom. The work for which I was here is over. Yes, mom. I'm all set to leave. I'll call you when my return ticket will be confirmed. No, mom. I'm absolutely all right. Just missing you. That's all. I love you, mom. Okay. Bye. You've decided to go back. And you didn't even tell me. There is no more reason to stay here. What are you doing? I've applied in Multi National Company for a job. So I got my appointment letter. Which address you've told them? It was my mistake that I thought that... ...this house will be your new address. I really don't want to... But I'm staying for that friend... Whose own son left the house. I can't leave him alone like this... And I won't left my dad alone... And won't go anywhere. Hey... let's celebrate. Come on. Oh... relax, Pratik. Take it easy. No. Today is the celebration day... Today we've booked the entire hotel. Our friend got freedom today, Kamia and Manjeet's chapter is closed. Your all problems are solved, Congratulations! Why you're sitting so quite? Please smile. Cheers. Anishka, the credit goes to you. You've done great acting of being his girlfriend, Superb. Once I felt she's actually in love with him. Nobody could think she was only acting. Everything looked so real. Everyone got fooled. You both looked so much in love. What a performance! That's a good performance. You're great. Superb! Excuse me. Why did you come here? Just like that. Pratik is a crazy guy. He says anything. By the way, only I know the truth. I know. You've tolerated me a lot. I'm feeling addicted to you after living so long with you. I really enjoyed your company. Anyways... Can I call you sometime? Will you come with me for coffee or dinner? Can't we extend this agreement? Till the end of this life! The one I found... the one who dwells in my eyes... The one I found... the one who dwells in my eyes... ...she has come in my arms. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Maybe we had to meet. We had to write this exciting love saga. Wait and watch what will happen now... When you're with me, we can reach the sky. Your words are magical. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Songs echo in the air. The season is romantic and the world seems new. This is the effect of love. When heart is in love, everything looks beautiful. In moonlit night... Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. What are you thinking? First time my parent's fight gave me something. And that's you Anishka. So that means I should be thankful to them. Yeah. But it's my bad luck... ...I can't share my happiness with them. Next week I'm going to play my final match... I'm very close to my life goal. But this time my family won't be with me to appreciate me. Will you listen to me, Chirag? Sidhu. Pal. Ask him what he came to prove? I didn't come to prove anything. I just came to apologize to uncle Dharam and Manjit. You all are responsibility for all this. Anishka. The girl I didn't even know is everything for me. I love Anishka. I want to marry her. But I won't do it without your wish. I don't want after marriage... ...we should have only court's marriage certificate. I want blessings of my dad and mom too. I'm sure you won't refuse. I want to share my happiness with both of you. With my mom and dad. For me... for your son... ...will you make mom agree. Please. Friend, where are you going? In life your son has asked for something for the first time. Won't you listen to him? You don't have to go to any stranger. She's your wife. Please go, friend. It's possible, this is the way for estranged to unite. Friend, don't worry about us. We don't choose destiny and matches. It's made in heaven. Correct, father. Anyway, they look so nice. Made for each other. Come. Come, son. Don't look like this. Won't you bless them? Enough. Come, son. Thank you, Dharampal. Come in. Madam, it's sir. Who? Your sir... Make him sit. I'm coming. Okay. Please. Sit down. Shalini. Didn't I disturb you at this hour? The reason for your arrival can disturb, not you. Shalini, we've passed our lives, whether it was good or bad. But now it's question of our son. Chirag came to me... ...with Anishka. He loves Anishka and wants to spend his life with her. She's a nice girl. I'm glad to hear that. So go ahead. You don't mind? Sidharth, will you use my son to win against me? I never thought that. What? Are you the same who brought his... ...friend's daughter seeing Kamya. And when Chirag rejected her too... ...now you've accepted that soap called... ...model your daughter- in- law. Great. Actually you're favoring my son to make him go against me. You're getting me wrong. Absolutely not. I'm not wrong. I know my son, his nature better than you. And that girl doesn't deserve my son. But Chirag... I've given my decision. Would you please excuse me now. Chirag. I tried my best. But your mother... didn't agree for it. Don't worry, son. I'm with you. Chirag. Chirag, everyone is looking for you. Why won't you answer my phone? Chirag. Phone me urgent. Call me back. Chirag, where are you? You won't answer any phone or reply my message. Everyone is worried. Where are you? Please phone me. I'm waiting for your call. Sidharth, where is Chirag? He won't come for practice. Only 2 days are left for Final match. All the formalities are left. Doesn't he want to play the match? Do you hear me? I don't know anything. What are you saying? The truth. Chirag isn't to be found. He won't answer mine, Anishka or uncle's phone. He didn't go for practice for a week. Aunt, he did everything to reach this Final. And today when it's the time... Aunt, please. Do something. Chirag. Yes. Why did you call me? Chirag, you know everyone is worried for you. Why are you doing this? I don't know. You've the right to take the decision of your life. If your happiness lies with Anishka... ...so be it. I don't mind, Chirag. But how can you take the credit by giving what's not yours? Chirag. Of course. I'm tired. I'm tired of thinking who is right or... ...who is wrong between my parents. Who loves me more and who loves me less. Chirag. What are you saying? Yes, mom. This is the truth. But you never realized it. You're happy thinking you've given everything to your son. Dad was always worried that your luxuries will ruin me. I've lived two different lives because of you. But it's enough. Let's end it. I want nothing. Neither you nor dad nor tennis. Just think that dad lost in the arena... ...and your son lost before. I won't tell you to sit, Shalini. Because I'm sure that our meeting won't be long. Don't waste time. Sidharth, what's time... ...we've ruined our lives. But today our son is on the verge of destruction. Our son... you're saying this. You've fought a battle all your life to make him yours. What is lacking that only a father can provide not a mother? Talkin Cinema with Karan Adarsh. People of India and UK... Chirag. If you'll play and lose so you'll be a winner, But if you'll give up and lose... Then you'll never forgive your self. Do you know Anishka? Why did I play Tennis? Because my dad give up. And I've decided that... I'll make him win from my victory. And I'll show my victory trophy to my mom. Now for who I'll play. Chirag! For those people with whom you've no relationship. But they still came to watch your game... They feel happy, they applause for you... In those viewers where your parents aren't there... But there are many parents over there... ...who are watching you playing... And told their kids... That play like Chirag. Good evening to you, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Pune Tennis stadium. You're about to witness the final of the... Yes, Vikram. Audience are impatient for this match. It's between defending champion Mahesh... ...and upcoming star Chirag Mehra. Vikram, this match has been in controversy... ...because of Chirag Mehra. Before the match there were questions is he'll play or not. Ladies and gentlemen the wait is finally over... and the players make their way from the dressing room to the court. And listen to the crowd as they cheer for both the players. We see the first sign of competition as Mahesh Singh... ...and Chirag Mehra give each other a cold flare. Players come on the court for the toss. Just look at Mahesh not taking the eyes of the opponent. Telling Chirag Mehra the challenger to the crown that... ...you've to bring out your best game or you're done. Chirag wins the toss and choses to serve. What should Chirag do to win the match? I think Chirag will have to be more aggressive... ...take his chances and hope for the best. Most important, he should be confident and mentally strong. And Chirag ready to serve. Mahesh smashes the ball into Chirag's body... ...and Chirag is unable to handle the ball. First blood! Champion Mahesh Singh gets love 15.Iove What a good passing shot! Mahesh looking come to the net. And finish the point... Chirag... The Chirag comes out with answer with his own. The first game goes to Chirag Mehra. Again Chirag changes the direction of... ...the ball and Mahesh can't return it. Chirag Mehra is playing with innovative and aggressiveness... ...and leading the first set by 52. Chirag has started strongly and he has... ...to maintain his momentum through. A great passing shot by Chirag of his back hand. Chirag Mehra. 60. 15. That's a commendable job. And I think if he continues in this spirit... ...there is nothing stopping him from winning this match. We got a nice set to watch... Chirag had an answer of every short... And Chirag won the first set of the match. And here it begins the second set... Mahesh Singh serves. What a serve! Mahesh Singh has started the set aggressively. Chirag. Focus. Chirag has to do something or else he'll lose this set. He's not able to concentrate the way he... ...was concentrating in the first set. Why we felt that something is bothering Chirag... It seems he's losing his focus. I think he needs to get his focus back again. And he's already trailing 1-4 in the second set. One more... What are we seeing here? I think this is absolutely uncalled... ...for in the good game of tennis. It reminds me of John McNore when... ...he used to argue with the umpire. It's not like him. Chirag is very calm by nature. It's not good to argue with umpire. I think he should just focus of his game... ...take control of himself and just move on with it. That's double fault. The second set goes to Mahesh Singh. And we're not level with one set a piece. If Chirag plays with the form of his first set... ...things can turn. Maybe the change of racket will bring him some luck. Chirag is lagging in the third set as well. Never double fault. Chirag needs to improve on his serve which has gone from bad to worse. Chirag! You can do it, son. Oh God! Chirag can't handle Mahesh's forehand pace. Third set is 4-2 to Mahesh Singh. And Chirag is making come back in the match. Everybody is looking for a fight and a competitive match. Quiet please. That was a bad ball. I think Chirag was wrong footed and he has twisted his ankle. We hope that won't be very serious. Physio is there at such an interesting point in the game... ...you know I mean... The score is levelled at 6 all. Injury is on the deciding tie break. Chirag is up. He'll begin the tie break. 7 points will win. The tie break will decide the match. Quiet please. 1 to Mahesh Singh. One more body shot. Mahesh started aggressively in tie break. Exciting match. Chirag is making a comeback in this game. That's another second hand by Chirag. Match point to Chirag. What an amazing turn around to the game! It's a nail biting finish. Now we've reached to that moment where... ...we'll get our next champion. Ladies and gentlemen, the match point. I understand the differences between... ...you and dad because of tennis. But I love this game. I want to play tennis. I'll make them win with my win. I'll show the trophy to mom. We've a new champion ladies and gentlemen. Our new all India tennis champion. Chirag Mehra. Well done, son. Mom... I love you, son. Congratulations. Anishka! Congratulation! Chirag won the match. I've won both the games. I have found the one who dwells in my eyes. I have found the one who dwells in my eyes. ...she has come in my arms. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Maybe we had to meet. We had to write this exciting love saga. Wait and watch what will happen now... When you're with me, we can reach the sky. Your words are magical. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Songs echo in the air. The season is romantic and the world seems new. This is the effect of love. When heart is in love, everything looks beautiful. In moonlit night... Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love. Slowly and slowly it happens, this is love.
