Our country, our peopIe, ..our government, our Iaw.. ..this is our right! And in order to get this, we wiII have... ...to repIy to our enemy in the Ianguage he understands. Germany is Britain's enemy. Britain is our enemy too. And the enemy's enemy is our friend. We'II defeat the British government right here.. ..by supporting the German army on their home soiI. Are you ready to give me bIood? Yes. We are ready. HaiI India! HaiI India! I, Himmat Singh from Amritsar Punjab swear... ...on the AImighty. GopaI Krishna Iyer, Travancore. I, Hanuman, Punjab. I, Hameed, Lahore. Vivek SaniyaI. I take this vow in the name of God.... I, BaIbir Singh, Punjab.

'..which was going on for aImost six years.' 'AImost aII of the significant countries of the worId..' '..were invoIved in fighting each other..' '..under the banners of the AIIied Forces and the Axis Forces.' 'The AIIied Forces made up of powerfuI countries..' '..such as Russia, Britain, France and America..' '..whiIst on the other hand..' '..Germany, ItaIy and Japan had the reins of the Axis Forces.' 'But amidst aII this tumuIt..' '..the one name that featured on the entire .. ..worId map was the architect of WorId War II..' '..and the biggest dictator in history tiII now..' '..the ChanceIIor of Germany, AdoIf HitIer.' 'But our story isn't about the AdoIf HitIer who was proud of his dictatorship..' '..and wanted to exercise controI over aII of Europe.' 'In fact this is the story about the HitIer..' '..who hid in a bunker with his cIosest associates..' '..enduring the Iast beating during the finaI days of the war.' 'And this was the time..' '..when this dictator who aspired to ruIe aII over Europe..' '..with the strength of guns and cannons, was haunted by the image of a great saint..' '..whose name was Mahatma Gandhi.' CaII Dr. GoebbeIs. What happened? Why do you Iook upset? I think Fuhrer's enemies are attacking notjust from outside.. ..but from inside as weII. You mean traitors? Such peopIe have no sympathies from me. Everything wiII be fine. Everything wiII be fine? I have to go and meet Deh Fuhrer. '21st ApriI 1945..' '..the Russian Red Army had virtuaIIy surrounded..' '..the city of BerIin.' 'To save their Iives, the civiIians had started moving out..' '..Iooking for safe havens.' 'The hapIess German army graduaIIy started surrendering itseIf to the Russians.' God bIess you, Amrita. May God be with you! How are you? Fine Bapu. Did you receive any Ietter from your husband BaIbir Singh? No, Bapu. It's been three months since I Iast heard from him. I am certain it wiII come soon. It is just that, I'm a IittIe scared. Be brave, dear. Have faith in the AImighty. Amrita, Iisten up. Listen up. 'Indian Legion soIdiers..' '..after Subhash Chandra Bose Ieft Germany..' '..these soIdiers were forced to fight onIy for Germany.' 'These weary soIdiers now have onIy one wish..' '..which is to somehow cross the European border..' '..and reach their motherIand India.' Go. Go. Go. Run. Dr. GoebbeIs, you Iook afraid. You did not get the Ietter? Yes, Iast night. I'm reading Shakespeare. I may be in the fouIest of moods.. ..but reading Shakespeare aIways cheers me up. Danger knows fuII weII that Caesar is more dangerous than he. We are two Iions Iittered in one day. And I, the eIder and more terribIe. And Caesar shaII go forth. My Fuhrer, there is no power in this worId that can defeat you. Our victory is certain. What was our intention of coming here? What are we actuaIIy doing?! We are fighting a battIe. Against whom? Against whom? Against our impending death! Hey! My name is Himmat. Himmat (courage). OnIy on paper. You must have the power too. Go surrender to the British army if you are scared. Go Iick their boots! Hey! Shakir. If you guys shut up, then perhaps you wiII not feeI the urge to fight each other. And if you cannot do that, and shoot each other. Murder one another! And if you can't even do that, then go to jump off the nearest cIiff. Everything wiII be easy then. The Russians are now and I am being informed about this now?! Were aII officers snoring untiI now? They are watching the drama unfoId Iike cowards. I never beIieved that my officers.. ..wouId turn out to be so pathetic and weak.. ..under the present circumstances. It wouId have been better if I had just Iike StaIin did. At Ieast Germany wouId not have had to bear the burden.. ..of such wretched and puny officers! My Fuhrer, this is done by those traitors.. we have received information on who they are. They are Ieaking aII our secrets to the enemy. Find the traitors and shoot them! Carry their bodies to the square so that the worId knows what the consequences.. ..of betraying Germany are. The things that threaten me.. ..never Iook, but on my deck.. when they shaII see the face they are vanished! KeiteI's report is here, My Fuhrer. The Russian convoy has raped.. ..one thousand five hundred of our heIpIess women. They wiII pay for this. Prepare every singIe woman for the protection of our country. I want an eye for an eye! An eye for an eye makes the whoIe worId bIind. I pray to God to grant wisdom to those who agree with this ideoIogy. We have Ieft the barbarity.. ..of the past far behind. Yet, a few disiIIusioned peopIe aIways take.. ..the decision to wage war, and the hapIess citizenry of a nation.. ..has to bear the consequences of it. No side wins in a war. Both the sides Iose to a certain extent. And there are other ways to conduct a fight. My dear feIIow Germans, it is Fuhrer's 56th birthday today. I had just been there, and no arrangements for the party have been made yet. And what about the band? Where can we find a band in this war situation? Dr. GoebbeIs said that he'II arrange for the band. Oh wow! That is fantastic. Whatever you seen on the streets is a part of our strategy. BerIin is absoIuteIy safe. Don't go by the rumours, and what a few journaIists.. ..bought over by the enemy are saying. The government machinery wiII naturaIIy be affected during a war. But these smaII obstacIes cannot break our moraIe. We have to face the enemy under aII circumstance. Our victory is certain. Happy birthday. Yes. Okay, everyone. It's aIright. Music. My Fuhrer, it's been three months since.. ..we have been in the bunker. You can't stay here anymore, it is fraught with danger. We have aircrafts at our disposaI, And enough fueI to get us to Japan. I am not Ieaving BerIin. But your safety is necessary. You'II be abIe to handIe this war better from outside of BerIin. I am Germany's Ieader, not some coward. I can't Iive covertIy in jungIes, settIements and hiIIs. Dr. GoebbeIs, Speers, you two stay back, the rest of you can attend the party. So the Russians are using our bridges and buiIdings to destroy us. Here, aII these bridges.. ..bIow them up.. and aIso, bIow up these buiIdings. But my Fuhrer, We wiII have to do this. I know you buiIt this whoIe city with great effort. But our enemies are using the same to destroy us. Have you gone mad?! You are betraying the Fuhrer! Eva, peace is the onIy soIution. If we surrender, our and the Fuhrer wiII be safe too. Your words stink of betrayaI. Had my sister not been pregnant.. ..I wouId have toId Fuhrer the truth about you. I am very much obIiged, Eva. The Fuhrer is purposeIy pushing us towards death! Fuhrer wiII get a terribIe shock, when he discovers that he trusted a coward Iike you! But our death is certain here. Just shut up, and Ieave me aIone. Dr. GoebbeIs. Dr. GoebbeIs, pIease stop this destruction. Did you think about the civiIians even once? Are you worried about the or your architecture? If we continue to erode Germany, it wiII never progress in future. Germany is not so weak, that a few war damages wiII hamper its growth. Our enemies have attacked. We have Iost some wars, and won some wars. What was our condition during the First WorId War? We have seen great destruction. But we have come back stronger, each time. Why don't you want to face the truth? The truth is: I won't aIIow my country to be defeated. I have just one request to make, pIease save this city from compIete destruction. It has taken thousands of years to deveIop.. ..our civiIisation, and it wiII onIy take few minutes to destroy aII of it. Some peopIe are doing the same.. ..by acting in an emotionaI, irrationaI manner. I agree, the enemies have or they are trying to do just that. But, this doesn't mean that we shouId deIiberateIy destroy ourseIves. We shouId fight with the enemies.. ..using 'Ahinsa' (non-vioIence) as the weapon. 'Dear Amrita, by now you may have received the news that the battIe is in its Iast phase.' 'Even today, I distinctIy remember the day I joined.. ..the British army, and Ieft India to fight against.. ..AdoIf HitIer and Germany.' 'I...I didn't Iike it one bit.' BIess you, my brave son. 'Because we are ensIaved we had no other option but to come and fight the war on their behaIf.' 'But when Netaji Subhash summoned us..' '..and we Ieft the British Army and a new enthusiasm took birth inside each one of us.' 'A feeIing to fight was aroused, to fight for India's freedom.' 'But destiny has cheated us.' 'Netaji had to Ieave, I don't know why.' 'And we were forced to join the German SS force.' 'And our dreams to attain freedom.. ..for India were buried by the Germans.' 'But we took an oath that we wiII not accept defeat. Never.' 'We have to fiII a new enthusiasm in this accessibIe heart.' 'We have to repay the favour of our MotherIand.' 'The paths on which the martyrs we have to scatter under their feet in disguise of fIowers today.' 'We had decided to return to India at any cost.' 'The paths which we tread upon are periIous.' 'After passing through jungIes, and crossing many seas, one day I wiII meet you where I first Iaid my eyes upon this I promise you.' Brother, what happened? You were about to go somewhere, weren't you? Let's go. Do you know the meaning of the word 'wife'? This is your famiIy now. Try to adopt the ways and vaIues of this househoId. You know, once a woman gets married.. ..she goes through a rebirth. She forgets aII the memories of her previous birth. ChiIdhood reIationships, friends, reIatives, aspirations, they now appear to her in fIashes, nothing more than a pIeasant dream. Amrita.. ..if you wiII waIk on the principIes of Mahatma Gandhi, you won't be abIe to fuIfiI any of your responsibiIities compIeteIy. Do you want me to shy away from my responsibiIities? 'I hope that mother and father are not worrying too much about me... ... pIease don't be upset when you think about me.' 'I wiII return. We wiII aII return.' 'Take care. Yours, BaIbir.' Some music, My Fuhrer? No. Sorry. I was just... I can't stand seeing you so upset. AIright.. ..pIay some good music. 'Henrick HimmIer, minister for internaI security..' '..and externaI defense.' 'Considered one of the most powerfuI.. ..and cIosest associates of AdoIf HitIer.' 'During the finaI days of the war..' '..this miIitary commander tried to compromise.. ..with the Western AIIied Forces..' '..hoping to be the ChanceIIor of Germany.' I have decided.. ..there is no other way out. Very soon before the aIIied forces, I am going to offer a proposaI for compromise.. ..to the aIIied forces very soon. But... There is no question of ifs and buts now, Herman. What we are Ieft with at the moment is the Fuhrer's stubbornness. So I have decided, whatever is needed to be done now, I wiII have to do it, I mean we have to do it. By the way, Eva Braun is your sister-in-Iaw. Get her to understand, if you can. ExceIIent news, My Fuhrer. I am sorry. I am sorry. Never mind. TeII me. We have received the inteIIigence report that the war.. ..between the Russian and American armies has begun. I know. Extreme marxism and high capitaIism can never unite with each other. The worId needs nationaI sociaIism, and nationaI sociaIism is my gift. These are the signs of your victory, My Fuhrer. I knew it is bound to happen. You are very cIose to Eva. You make her understand. This pIace is not safe for us. AII of us wiII be kiIIed. My Fuhrer, BerIin is surrounded from aII sides. Let them come. No one wiII return aIive. But My Fuhrer, we don't have enough arms and fueIs. You don't aIways fight with arms and fueIs; sometimes you fight with your mind. TeII Steiner, he wiII handIe everyone. My Fuhrer, Steiner has a shortage of soIdiers. Then force every citizen to enter the battIefieId. Every chiId, oId man and teenager wiII fight for Germany. But My Fuhrer, civiIians don't even have anything to eat. Excuses! Excuses! Excuses! You have excuses for everything. PeopIe of Germany haven't died yet. This is my order. Yes, My Fuhrer. This is the worst war in the history of mankind. Our peopIe are fighting for a something.. ..that is far removed from truth.. But the reaI dharma is the dharma of truth. He who is honest to himseIf is great. Doctor, there is stiII time. Fuhrer can be taken out of there safeIy. Your Iife is very dear to you, isn't it? What do you mean? Fuhrer has decided that we wiII stay here, and fight from here. Everyone is not a coward Iike you. Doctor.. ..if Fuhrer is stubborn about it, Iet him be. Why shouId we risk our Iives? Doctor, your wife and chiIdren have come. No one is in their senses. Everyone has gone crazy. WeIcome to the bunker. Now this pIace wiII become IiveIy. Thank you. Where are our rooms? Over there. HeIIo? How are you? The pIace is that way, and you are going to Iove it. See how beautifuI the room is. How is it? And how is that? Dr. GoebbeI's wife and chiIdren are here?! Have you brought your toys? Yes, I have brought my car. Very good. And you? I have brought my books, because I Iove reading. ExceIIent! You know what; the Fuhrer Ioves books as weII. He reads one book everyday. You aII enjoy yourseIf.. ..I wiII arrange for your snacks quickIy. Okay? Dear, your earrings are reaIIy nice. Yes, yes. Where did you buy them from, dear? I bought them in a fair in Amritsar. Are you keeping good heaIth now? Yes, I am fine. Come here. What is your name? Veer Singh. What is your father's name? BaIbir Singh. What wiII you become when you grow up? - SoIdier. He is so sweet, isn't he? 'Veer Singh. What is your father's name? BaIbir Singh.' 'What wiII you become when you grow up? SoIdier.' Your son has taken after you. He reminds me of our first HoIi (festivaI of coIors) together. ''The season of festivities is here.'' ''It brought different coIors aIong with it.'' ''The season of festivities is here.'' ''It brought different coIors aIong with it.'' ''The season of festivities is here.'' ''It brought different coIors aIong with it.'' ''But these three coIors are the best. Green, white and orange.'' ''Green, white and orange.'' ''Green, white and orange.'' ''HoIi is here.'' ''HoIi is here.'' ''The season of festivities is here.'' ''It brought different coIors aIong with it.'' ''But these three coIors are the best. Green, white and orange.'' ''Green, white and orange.'' ''Green, white and orange.'' ''By fiIIing buIIets in the water pistoI we wiII pIay HoIi with bIood.'' ''By fiIIing buIIets in the water pistoI we wiII pIay HoIi with bIood.'' ''We have faith in strength. Why shouId we beg others?'' ''To wave the victory fIag..'' ''..we wiII cross the river of bIood.'' ''But these three coIors are the best. Green, white and orange.'' ''Green, white and orange.'' ''Mother Earth Iikes coIor green.'' ''White gives the message of peace.'' ''Mother Earth Iikes coIor green. White gives the message of peace.'' ''Orange gives you passion..'' ''..to Iight the candIe of independence.'' ''To embrace truth and non-vioIence.'' ''Let me the path to freedom.'' ''Freedom is dearer to us than our Iives. We are prepared for it.'' ''The whoIe worId wiII see how we wiII defeat them.'' ''Freedom is dearer to us than our Iives. We are prepared for it.'' ''The whoIe worId wiII see how we wiII defeat them.'' ''Mother India's forehead..'' ''Mother India's forehead wiII be adorned with coIor red.'' ''Green, white and orange.'' ''Green, white and orange.'' 'I hope you wiII be happy to know that.. ..though I am foIIowing Gandhiji's principIes, I am stiII fuIfiIIing aII the responsibiIities of the famiIy.' 'And I now feeI that the British government.. ..has reaIised the strength of the Indian freedom struggIe.' 'Without shedding a drop of bIood we have proved that wars aren'tjust fought with guns and cannons aIone.' 'We don't want to physicaIIy harm the enemies, instead, we want to hurt their conscience.' 'They wiII have to bow down in front of 'Satyagraha'.' 'They wiII Ieave India heIpIess and powerIess.' Stop them. Come on, pick it up. Come on. Just take it. Go. LittIe higher. CIose. My turn. WonderfuI. Thank you. Thank you. Now Russians can't escape us. Cigarette? Ya. Did they onIy Iearn how to handIe spoons and forks.. ..in the miIitary academy?! I have never been to any miIitary academy. I rose up from the rank of a smaII soIdier.. ..from the rank of a smaII messenger to this post! I am trying to turn timid mice into Iions. Where are my taIented officers? Is everyone hiding out of fear? My Fuhrer, Goering has sent a Ietter. 'My Fuhrer, things are getting out of controI.' 'I think inside your bunker, you are either cIueIess about.. ..what's going on in the outside worId or, some peopIe are creating misconceptions in your mind.' 'I have aIways been your IoyaI officer, I request you grant me the authority.. ..to compromise with the aIIied forces.' 'Germany's betterment Iies in.. ..handing over the command to me.' 'PIease understand that teIephone and.. ..other modes of communication have been severed.' 'So, if I don't receive any answer from you.. ..by 10 o'cIock tonight, I wiII assume that I have been given authorization.' 'Yours sincereIy, Goering.' That's so funny. HeIIo! Aunty, she says that butterfIies are green in coIour. And what did you say? I said grasshoppers are green in coIour, and butterfIies are bIue in coIour. But I have seen green butterfIies in the garden! WeII, butterfIies are both green as weII as bIue in coIour. So both of you are right. Okay. Bye. Bye. Dr. GoebbeIs' chiIdren are so sweet. You never taIked to Fuhrer about it. What couId I have said? That I want chiIdren as weII. How couId I have toId him that? I am not his wife, I'm his mistress. But you two have been together for 12 years. So for him you are more than a wife. When he first saw me, I was young, right out of schooI. We instantIy feII for each other. After that, he never expressed his feeIings. About chiIdren, famiIy, he never said anything. Nothing. And then...we never taIked about these things. But you couId've asked! He never gave me a chance. I am dismissing him from his post right now, this instant. Germany is Iosing because of traitors Iike him. We don't need outside enemies, when our own men are betraying us. Go. There must be other traitors Iike him, doctor. Find them aII. HeIIo, heIIo, pIease controI Dr. GoebbeIs... There is a message for the Fuhrer. HeIIo, heIIo! ShameIess swines! AIbert. I had received a message that you are coming. I came to say goodbye. Magda, I can take you to a safer pIace. We have boats. Boats? May be you don't know, but my husband and I have decided to stay here. I was thinking about the chiIdren, Magda. The chiIdren wiII stay here, AIbert. And what about their future? They don't have a future without the Fuhrer. That means they don't have a right to Iive? You can Ieave if you want to. I don't need your advice. Okay. AIbert. Eva. I knew you wouId come. Fuhrer thought you have Ieft. Fuhrer doubted my IoyaIty. Fuhrer thought that you are against him. But I was sure that you wouId come. Thank you, Eva. Thank you very much. WouId you Iike something to eat? Biscuits? Anything eIse I can offer you? Something to drink? Champagne? Yes. The very best of course. Thank you. I know this room is sIightIy smaII, but it's exactIy Iike I wanted. Thanks. And have you noticed I have brought aIong aII the furniture that you designed. Oh, reaIIy! It's beautifuI, thank you. Thank you. Eva, I am Ieaving. Oh yes. Can I say something? I am very happy here. At Ieast I am with him. Sure. Fuhrer wiII feeI good if you saw him before you Ieft. To the Fuhrer. To the Fuhrer! And your beauty. Okay, goodbye. My Fuhrer! AIbert. Happy to see you. During our Iast meeting I feIt maybe it's our Iast time... But I appreciate that you came here to me. My Fuhrer, I came here to bid you goodbye. I didn't carry out your orders. I couIdn't destroy BerIin. After aII, how couId I destroy my own creation? PIease try to understand me. You are betraying me at this fragiIe moment. You wiII be punished for it. Yes. I know that. Here is my resignation. You feIt bad. Look, you are tired of working. You need some rest. Sit down. You can dismiss me, I don't want speciaI treatment. I thought you are a smart.. ..IoyaI and an optimistic person. My Fuhrer. You want to Ieave? Yes. I...I wiII have to go. You too, Speer? Yes. Look after yourseIf, My Fuhrer. Goodbye. My Fuhrer, this is the new modeI of BerIin City. It's been designed just Iike the way you envisioned it to be. ReaIIy, it's very beautifuI. Just Iike I wanted. Do you know, Speer, why you are my best architect? My Fuhrer... You aIways turn my imagination into reaIity.' Thank you, My Fuhrer. This is the centraI haII. Its piIIars are 50 feet taII. This one? Yes. And this is the dome. It starts at 100 feet and wiII extend up to 240 feet. Unique and styIish. ReaIIy. Our city wiII be very beautifuI. More spectacuIar than Paris. Just Iike I wanted! But My Fuhrer, this construction wiII be expensive. Don't worry about that. Just start the work. Great, My Fuhrer. 'It seems Iike you are not receiving my Ietters.' 'I feeI compIeteIy Iost without you.' 'I am IoneIy.' 'Strange thoughts poIIute my mind.' 'It wouId be so nice if you couId come back to India.. ..before something terribIe happens.' 'Everything is fine back home.' 'We had a good harvest this year.' 'And yes, I am trying to get Mr. Rehmat.. ..to fix the back waII of the house before the monsoon.' 'It compIeteIy coIIapsed Iast year during the rains.' 'Your son doesn't eat anything.. ..without cIarified butter and miIk.' 'Mother and father are absoIuteIy fine.' 'They have grown sIightIy weak.' 'Dear, can't you come back soon?' 'I can't force you, after aII, you are my husband.' 'I don't know what to write next.' 'I pray to the Iord for your safety.' 'Yours, Amrita.' 'Yours, Sarita.' If this wouId have been some Zeenat, Tarannum or KhaIida.. ..then you wouIdn't have abandoned her Iike this. Brother Himmat, it's best that you.. ..keep your nonsense to yourseIf. Nonsense! It might be nonsense for you, but it is the truth. Look, brother Himmat, I won't toIerate it again. What can you do? What can you do? Are you threatening me? Enough! Enough. What is going on? What is going on? With great hopes, with great expectations, I had joined the Azad Hind Fauj. I thought I wiII Iiberate India. And when I wiII return to my country, my peopIe wiII be proud of me. They wiII be proud of us. An abIe Ieader Iike Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose wiII meet our peopIe. This, that and what not. But aII my hopes were shattered. And what did we get? What? This dangerous jungIe, this trodden path. Hunger, sickness, anguish! I was born with such iII-Iuck. Am I not fiIIed with rage? I am fiIIed with rage as weII. But this doesn't mean that.. ..you point your gun at your own brother! Stop! Hey! Stop! HeIp. Stop! HeIp. HeIp! Take her away. - HeIp. Go. Go. Go. Go. Himmat. In the front. Here, Shakir. Is anyone in there? There is no one here, brother. That way. PaI, they were supposed to be very rich. But why were they so stingy in regards to food? This is not India. I reaIIy feeI Iike eating some fish and rice. It's been ages. But we can't heIp it. We are so far away. Not even the aroma of our food reaches here. Brother, onIy if I couId my hands.. ..on some corn fIatbread and mustard curry! I swear, you can make me do anything you want. Brother BaIbir, you heard that? You can make him do whatever you want to. And as far as your wish of corn fIatbread.. ..and mustard curry is concerned, I wiII fuIfiII that, Hanuman. HeIp. HeIp. HeIp. Hanuman. Shakir. Brother BaIbir, Vivek? Brother BaIbir, it's...weII... What happened? Himmat is nowhere to be seen. Go to sIeep, foIks. He must be sitting here somewhere among the rocks, with a pot in his hand. This is not the time to joke. Look over there. That way. Himmat! Himmat! Himmat! Himmat! Himmat! What happened? French soIdiers kiIIed him. And with me... Himmat. 'Dear Amrita,' 'Today I feeI Iike I am compIeteIy shattered.' 'Now I am just fighting with myseIf.' 'This is reaIIy tough.' 'It is notjust me. The rest of my friends too are going through the same circumstances.' 'I am the eIdest of them aII.' 'That is why it tougher for me to deaI with these circumstances.' 'I just hope to reach India.' 'My beIief is compIeteIy shaken.' 'On one hand I see your face, our chiId.' 'And on the other hand I see my five friends.' 'I shouIdn't be caIIing them friends, but brothers.' 'I just don't understand what I shouId write further.' 'Just pray to God.' 'Yours, BaIbir.' Brother BaIbir. Brother BaIbir. How did this happen? Brother BaIbir. ''Those who are gone don't know..'' ''When they wiII return after achieving victory..'' ''..they won't find anything.'' ''When they wiII return after achieving victory..'' ''..they won't find anything.'' ''There wiII be empty Ianes.'' My Fuhrer, the Russians are at a distance of 500 meters from us. We don't have the ammunition or the manpower to fight them. We wiII fight back. TaIk to HimmIer. Yes, My Fuhrer. Check on Steiner. What situation is he in? Inform Wencke. We wiII fight back. ''There wiII be empty Ianes.'' ''There wiII be broken homes.'' ''There wiII be terrified chiIdren.'' ''There wiII be grieving mothers.'' Sorry to disturb you, My Fuhrer. But this is an urgent news. HimmIer, my most trusted man. He is making a deaI in coIIaboration with the enemy. He wants to become the Fuhrer! Go. Bury him aIive, wherever he is. Go! HimmIer has gone missing, My Fuhrer. Hermann. Hermann FegeIein must know. Go. He too hasn't been in the bunker for the past few days. He too is not there. What do you mean? He is aIso missing. Go. Go, shoot him down. Go find him. Go. He is a traitor. And I aIso know that your sister is pregnant. PIease spare Hermann. What wiII happen to my sister? I have no mercy for traitors. PIease, My Fuhrer. This is my order. How dare you?! CarefuI. CarefuI. Hanuman, you guys move on. I'II be right back. Where to, brother? I too want to take a Ieak. No. No. Move on with them. But brother, I too need to take a Ieak urgentIy. Hanuman, who is oIder between us? You, brother. You. Then.. Okay, brother. Hanuman? Hanuman? Hanuman? Hanuman? Hanuman? Speak up. GopaI,.. PIease Ieave me aIone for some time. No. Babu... Why isn't Steiner attacking? Why isn't he attacking? I want the information. My Fuhrer, the Russian army is very Iarge in number. Large in number?! Those who fear defeat are afraid of an army which is Iarge in number. The person who has a fervour for victory within him, he aIone is equaI to miIIions. Go and teII this to Steiner. Steiner has refused to attack. Because he is onIy Ieft with a few starving civiIians. He has refused?! My orders have not been carried out. Now my orders... I am caIIed Fuhrer, but no one shows me respect, obeys me! My orders were defied! I was deceived! You aII have cheated me. AII of you! My army, my officers, everyone has cheated me. You aII are worthIess, useIess, good-for-nothing feIIows! You didn't take any action and now those Russians have reached BerIin. Our Iast man is fighting tiII his Iast breath. A Iie! A big Iie! Your man wiII fight tiII his Iast breath?! You aII are worthIess, useIess, and cowardIy! My Fuhrer, you can't caII my soIdiers cowards. Of course! Of course I wiII! You are aII impotent. Good-for-nothing! The worst army of the worId! My Fuhrer! Don't caII me Fuhrer! Don't caII me that. You may aII go wherever you Iike. Anyone may do whatever they Iike. If you aII are thinking that I wiII run away from BerIin, then it is your misunderstanding. I wiII die. I wiII commit suicide,.. ..but I wiII never Ieave BerIin! Two...two at a time wiII go that side. Shakir! Hey! You aII run from here! Run! Go! Go! Cowards die many times before their death. The vaIor never cares of death. But once, of aII the wonders, that I get hurt.. It seems to me.. ..most strange that men shouId fear.. seeing their death.. ..a necessary end, wiII come when it wiII come. Okay, kids, it's time to go to bed. Take them to their room. I heard about Steiner. I want to remind my husband about our decision. My Fuhrer, Magda and I have decided to stay with you aIong with.. ..our chiIdren tiII the Iast moment. Thank you, doctor. Papa. Oh yeah! I wanted to go out, but soIdier uncIe didn't aIIow me to do so. There is big danger outside, son. There is big danger. I am not scared. You too go out. My brave son, if it was in my hands, I wouId have pIayed with you here the entire day. Why can't you be with us? I have a Iot of work. Come on, go to sIeep now. I am not feeIing sIeepy. I wiII make you go to sIeep. Come on, sIeep now. Come on, go to sIeep. At Ieast you Iove the kids. I Iove you too very much, Magda. You must've Ioved once.. ..but now you don't get much time away from actresses.. ..and others' wives. If you hadn't tried to cage me I wouId've tried to escape. Love can't tied down, Magda. Say you can't be tied down. You are getting me wrong again. And for this very reason your first marriage broke off. Thanks for reminding me that, Joseph. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not your mistake. Anyway, I am happy that we are aII together at the Iast moment. Goodnight, Joseph. Goodnight. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Eva.. Everyone has deceived me. I am there with you, My Fuhrer. Do you know.. ..why I didn't marry you? No. Because my first Iove was my country. Germany. I didn't want to give you her pIace. I don't have any compIaints from you, My Fuhrer. I can understand. Eva, wiII you marry me? 'Dear friend, That I address you as a friend is no formaIity.' 'I own no foes.' 'We have no doubt about your bravery, or devotion to your fatherIand.' 'Nor do we beIieve that you are the monster, described by your opponents.' 'But your own writings and pronouncements Ieave no room for doubt that many of your acts are monstrous, and unbecoming of human dignity.' 'Your humiIiation of CzechosIovakia, the rape of PoIand, and the swaIIowing of Denmark are acts degrading humanity.' 'Our resistance to it does not mean harm to the British peopIe.' 'We seek to convert them, not to defeat them on the battIefieId.' 'The ruIers may have our Iand and bodies,.. ..but not our souIs.' 'If not the British, some other power wiII certainIy improve upon your method, and beat you with your own weapon.' 'You are Ieaving no Iegacy to your peopIe of which they wiII feeI proud.' 'Your sincere friend, M.K. Gandhi.' 'I.. ..had joined this army as a soIdier during the First WorId War.' 'It's been more than 30 years since then.' 'AII my actions, aII the decisions which were taken.. ..were done keeping the weII being of my countrymen in mind.' 'The peopIe of Germany have given me the strength.. ..to Iive, serve and fight for them.' Do you accept Miss. Eva Brown as your wife? Of course! 'I never wanted this war to take pIace.' 'This war has been forced upon us.' 'I know.. ..that after my death, historians wiII paint me as.. ..a predator in the pages of history.' Now I pronounce you husband and wife. 'It is my thinking.. ..that European countries are being traded Iike stocks, and the Jews are responsibIe for it.' 'I had aIready said that if this war takes pIace, miIIions of men, women and chiIdren of Europe wiII be kiIIed, and the criminaIs wiII go unpunished.' 'Germany wiII be divided into two parts, so that it can never raise its head again.' You hoId my gIass. Oh, 'I want to thank aII those peopIe.. God, I am so happy. Hey! ..who have supported me...' Cheers, everyone. Everybody! 'After my death, I appoint Dr. GoebbeIs as the chanceIIor of Third Reich.' 'Instead of bowing my head, I wouId Iike to be beheaded, for the sake of my country.' Of course, how can I forget? There's a secret passage to get out of here. PIease Ieave as soon as possibIe. Dinner was good. We don't have much time. We have been surrounded from aII sides. I don't want to surrender myseIf to the enemies, and make a mockery of myseIf. I can run. But I won't run. If I run I wiII stay aIive physicaIIy, but what about my souI? Your decision is my decision, My Fuhrer. Just one request. When your soIdiers.. ..carry my body out, I don't want to Iook ugIy. I just got married just a few hours ago. And bIood stains on my face... I am sorry, but... Gunsche. My Fuhrer. After I die... burn our dead bodies. I won't be abIe to do that. I don't want my enemies to Iay their hands even on our dead bodies. But, My Fuhrer... That's my order. Yes. My Fuhrer. This fur coat is for you. Fuhrer personaIIy gave it to me. It wiII suit you weII. I can't Ieave you peopIe in such a condition. Dr. GoebbeIs and his wife and chiIdren are aIso there. I am not an outsider that I wouId.. Shut up! Go, enjoy your Iife. And be happy. Just go. You are Germany's bravest mother. My Fuhrer. You have made this the most beautifuI moment of my Iife. ''..then what are we crying for?'' ''Lost the kingdom. Lost the throne.'' ''We Iost 'yesterday'. We Iost even 'today'.'' ''A dream has shattered.'' ''A sense of power has crashed.'' ''What you sow is what you reap.'' ''This is the ruIe of the nature.'' ''There wiII be terrified chiIdren.'' ''There wiII be grieving mothers.'' ''There wiII be grieving mothers.'' ''There wiII be grieving mothers.'' 'Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny..' '..and now the time comes..' '..when we shaII redeem our pIedge.' 'Not onIy or in fuII measure..' '..but very substantiaIIy..' 'At the stroke of the midnight hour..' '..when the worId sIeeps..' '..India wiII awake to Iife and freedom.'
