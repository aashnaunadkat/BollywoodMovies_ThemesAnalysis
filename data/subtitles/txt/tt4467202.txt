These two work for Sooraj. That's Salim and that one's Gangu. Why did you bring them here? Because we're going to use them as baits to lure him here. Get that? Hey BBM... We sent a BBM too... to Suraj. Enough of your 'Sing-song'. He's going to ring your bell 'ding-dong'. Sooraj! We've found BBM sir. Run, Brij. Sooraj.. ..do you think you're a hero? No! Changezi, I have my doubts. If you like gambling, then.. ..you should pay up like a good sport. Let's go, BBM. Sooraj! You've got some good punch lines. Let's test your punch as well. Changezi bhai, your men are getting beaten up. And you're comfortably eating chicken. Just saying. When Changezi stands up... he's taller than the world. Salim... Ibrahim uncle's daughter is getting married. So deliver 300,000 Rs to him. An Rathodi,...what was the name of that boy.. ..we promised to help for his MBA? Dinesh. Yeah. Give him 200,000 Rs. Why are you abusing me? What damage? He's right. We mean nothing to you, don't we? Sooraj, you do this all the time. Right, you're distributing our hard-earned money. Sooraj, we want our share. You Bengali. Did you invest this money that now you're asking for your share? What will you do with money? We'll party. You promised us. Yes. Sooraj. What do you say, Mangya? Party at a up-market place. Let's go. Sorry guys, I am late. But that Abhi, he's such a dimwit. I said it's over between us. "Where were you? Who were you with?" I told him it's over between us. You mean you broke up with him. So now he's your ex-boyfriend. Yes. Now I'm going to Paris in a month.. ..and I don't want any excess baggage along. I just want to be free. Let's take a bathroom selfie, guys. Come on, we need a refill. I am going to miss you. Let's take a selfie. Look what he is doing? Who's that crazy guy? Loser! What a loser! "We're the King of Hearts..." "we love to enjoy." "We sit on our car's bonnet..." "and have a feast." "We're the King of Hearts..." "we love to enjoy." "We sit on our car's bonnet..." "and have a feast." "Our demands are unique." "and wear torn jeans." "And let our shirt stay unbuttoned." "we're the legends of this dancing-floor." "We can make you sway..." "because we're the heroes of this realm." "Girls can't dance like this..." "we're the legends of dancing-floor." "We can make you sway..." "because we're the heroes of this realm." "We're the legends of the dance-floor." "We make the speaker go "Thump-Thump-Thump." "Show me... what you got." "You might have a Mercedes." "But I have a cycle." "You're the club's Shakira." "I am the neighborhood Michael." "You might have a Mercedes." "But I have a cycle." "You're the club's Shakira." "I am the neighborhood Michael." "All your brands are fake." "Why do you want to be a wannabe?" "You local boys don't know anything about international rhythm." "Girls can't dance like this..." "we're the legends of the dancing-floor." "We can make you sway..." "because we're the heroes of this realm." "Your turn." "What you got." "I am the original." "And you're the cheap rip-off." "My attitude's hotter... than your dancing."

"we're the legends the dancing-floor." "We can make you sway..." "because we're the heroes of this realm." I've been trying to call you for two hours.. ..and you're partying out here. Let go. Leave me. We've broken up, don't you understand? I will decide that. Stay away, I am going to call my dad. You get that. Leave me. Let her go. Let her go. Hey... stop the music. Security, close the exit door! Manager, call the ambulance! I am going to make him... This going to be really messy. Hey, stop... stop yo... Bloody rascal... Wait... wait... Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you... See. I told you it's going to be a big mess. Let's go. You should be all suspended. How could you let her go alone? Sir, you.. I said Radha won't go anywhere alone. Speak up now. Dheeraj. What? Yes... Dad. Tell me what happened? Ruchi. Ruchi. Baby. What happened? She's getting pains. Is it time? Shall we go? Dad... Help me. Dad, call the ambulance. Dad... baby coming. Dad, baby's here. Dad.. Hi, mom-dad. What's up? What's up? Do you know how worried dad was? But I did tell him. This won't do. You broke everyone's trust. Mr. Dheeraj. Yes. You're a pathetic actor. What? Yes. And you too. And you... stop being a drama queen. Dad. Dad, chill. Take a look at these security guys. Whenever my friends see them, my friends say here comes the Cavalry. This is wrong. No, dad. If you want me to get security.. ..then atleast get me some cooler, hipper guys. You can all go. Thank you very much. Dad. What's all this? Sorry. I promise I'll keep security from tomorrow. Don't be mad. And anyway, I am the IG's daughter. I am not scared of some Pasha or anyone else. "This is an important day for IG Srikant Mathur." "The Mumbai High Court..." "will hear the charge-sheet on the..." "PWD Minister Suryakant Pasha-Ranade case." "Pasha is accused for the murder of noted journalist Samay Patil." "And Srikant Mathur has put 40 years of his experience..." "at stake for this case." "Can Pasha escape?" Let's go. We've just confirmed that the Mumbai High-Court.. ..has issued a section 302 against Pasha for 1st Degree murder. The next hearing on this case will be on 18th February. Sir, Pasha says that you're falsely accusing him. Is it true? Do you think the court will pass judgment.. ..on Pasha or my word? The court wants evidence, which the Mumbai Police has. And we'll present it on the 18th. Okay? Yes, sir. Come. Sir, one more question.. Sir... please, sir.. Sir.. Sir... please, sir.. A senior journalist was murdered. And Mumbai Police's IG Srikant Mathur.. ..is investigating this case personally. IG Srikant Mathur... is a very capable officer. And a highly decorated officer too. He wants to retire with a bang. But... the case he chose is wrong. There is no evidence against me in the Samay Patil murder case. Jay Hind. I just don't understand what that IG has! I've been looking for it for six months. I did everything from greasing palms to putting pressure. But that IG is a living example of honesty.. ..and sc****ing us. What's he hiding? It's time to call him. I stopped you from doing so. But... this IG's honesty cannot be bought... It can only be shattered. And only he can do this job. Sooraj! Come on. Move. Oh God... So Surya... no time to spare for your father, huh! But you've been showing-off at discos. Father, I was just.. I was only joking. Sit down. It's been so long since we last met. And your smile... I completely forgot how it looked. See... I still couldn't do it. When he was a kid, I would try to pull off this trick every day.. But I would fail and he would laugh at me. Your mother was like a sister to me. She pestered me a lot. Each day she would come up and say.. "We need to help him today... or him.." She always cared about others more than herself. Ibrahim's daughter's marriage... Dinesh's MBA... I've the full report. Father... what's all this? I know. I want to get out of here. Will you do something for me? Stupid. Stupid. Can't believe them. You? You? I see... So dad sent you for my security. Yes. Inspector Sooraj Kaushik. Secretary Division.. Security Division! Crime Branch, Mumbai Police. Your life is in danger. Some people want to kidnap you.. ..and blackmail IG sir. Sir's orders are that we take you someplace safe. Give me your phone. He broke my phone last night. Start the car. I hate you Dhiraj.. Yeah, Radha. Dad, these officers are saying my life's in danger. Dheeraj, you take this car, I'll take the other one. Hello, dad, I can't hear you. Should I go with them? Just do as they say, okay. Thanks. Let's go. What? Are you hard of hearing? Let's go. Ohh... my bag's in the car. Constable, get the bag. Fine, we're leaving now. Call up Radha, okay. Okay, son. "This person's phone is switched off. Please try later." Mr. Mathur... This is absolute violation of my client. Hey... Lawyer... I'll see what you do? Behave yourself. He's the IG of Police, remember. It's a big post. Bloody rascal... Dad, please. Dad! Very good. Bravo, son. His daughter is missing. I can understand a father's condition. You're going through a tough phase, Mr. Mathur. Who knows where she is... or with whom? No one knows. Mr. Lawyer. Hmmm. When is the next hearing? 18th February. 18th February. That's too far. I can't help you from behind the bars. Pasha... You must have heard that.. ..parents can even give-up their lives for their children. You did, didn't you? This father... will take yours. Now do one thing. Get a picture taken... of yourself. Neat and tidy. For your mourning. Wow! IG broke the Law... Now he'll break. Send the message to Surya. Keep an eye on the girl. Keep her cozy. Get out! I said get out! How dare you bring me to this godforsaken ****... ..back of an excuse of a safe house. Madam, even we can abuse in English. Come on, Mangya. I cannot believe it. You're assaulting an on-duty police officer. You'll be arrested for this. Police officer my foot. I want to call my dad... give me a goddamn phone! Are you done? Give me the plate. Move. Hi. I've some fruits and extra blanket. It's quite cold outside. Cut it out. Don't pretend to be so good. Where are you keeping me? Damp... dirty... cold! This is what you will get here. We're taking care of you because those are the IG sir's orders. Blanket... and eat. I don't want your bloody or... Or what? You're hurting me. You can't call. There's no signal here. We must stay here until 18th February. You must be hungry, please eat it. What's wrong? At home we all eat together. I'm Not used to eating alone. Eat. It's a girl. Bring my Radha back, Sri. Do whatever you can, just do what they're saying. We cannot lose another child. I am a police officer. And a police officer's children is not.. Please! Please. "On the pages of my eyes... I wrote a hundred times." "The love that I had... was hard to convey." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." Salim, Gangu, where's the girl. Find her. What are you all looking at? Did you find her? I am the IG's daughter, I can do it. What to do? Crazy. She's seen us. Hide... hide... Stupid. Just wait. She's coming this way. What are you all doing here? We were looking for you. But what are you doing here, sister? Bathing. Any problem? You call this bathing! French Bath. French Bath? This is how people bathe in France. Ohh... I see.. French bath. Madam, if you want to bathe like Indians.. ..you will find hot water inside. Move. Finish bathing. French Bath! "O damsel... your eyes..." "I can even die for them." "You fight with me... and crazy for me too." "These tricks... won't help you in anyway." "O sweetheart... let's hold hands and let our hearts be one." "O sweetheart... someone yank the chain in her brain.." "and let her fall in love." "She laughs... shows attitude as well." "Some fix her." "Someone sprinkle some ice on her fire and chill her out." "O sweetheart... someone yank the chain in her brain.." "and let her fall in love." "But not with you." "You don't get it do you?" What? Water. Hot. Thanks. "O sweetheart..." "I can die for them..." What? Nothing. Are we short of water? Would you like us to bathe together? No! Stop, Suraj I can do it too. Stop. Pakya, give it here. Here.. here. Suraj, step aside. Stop it. Snow bath. Gangu. Salim! Hi.- Hi. Where's Gangu and Salim? Maybe they went to the market? Rathodi too? Yes. Does that mean we're all alone? Yes! Thanks. Okay. I mean... You take such good care of me. So thanks. You must be thinking "What a mess I am in". But after... Oh my God. So hot. And anyway, I am going to Paris. Dance scholarship. Dad won't let you go there with me. And you must have a girlfriend too. She won't let you come with me. I don't have a girlfriend. Really... I mean... why? Because I am a police officer. I hardly get any time for myself. So how will I find a girlfriend? But suppose you find sometime for yourself. So what kind of girl will you look for? I.. A bit shorter... and stout. And her hair.. Should be violet... same color. Stupid! Listen... Let me know if there's someone. "I've brought you to my world." "So what if our paths are separate.." "but our hearts are now one." "Your world... is different from mine." "But we can atleast hold hands for few moments." "Someone touch her lips, and make it sweet like chocolate." "Someone give her wings and let her love soar high." "She laughs... shows attitude too." "Some fix her." "O sweetheart... let's hold hands and let our hearts be one." "O sweetheart... someone yank the chain in her brain.." "and let her fall in love." Are you trying to fly a kite? No, poor people are getting humiliated. They promise us food, clothing and mobile. But what about network? Sir! Sir! We just received information from Jammu. He's one of Suraj's accomplices, his name is Rathodi. Yes, Dheeraj. Dad, we've found Radha. Another night, another bottle, no change. Let's change then, let's sleep this side. Where's my bottle? Over! This is over too! Now? What? Do you know what is today? Friday? No stupid. Do you know what day is it today? Salim, what day is it today? It's a dry day. No. Today is Valentine's Day. Do you know one does on this day? No. You hold your Valentine's hand. Look into her eyes, and... Hello... Mr. Valentine! Happy Valentine's Day! Mangya! Mangya! Mangya! Gangu! Mangya! It's okay. Gangu run! Radha run! Pasha's men. Yeah! Shall we? Where's Radha? Where's Radha? No! No! No one will fire at the bike. Stop firing! Sooraj's left with Radha. I repeat, Sooraj's left with Radha! Stop them. Block the road. Move fast. Move fast. The chopper hasn't arrived yet. Hold on. Hasn't the chopper left from Chandigarh yet? Sir, I did call them. Out! All units move down the river. I repeat. All units move down the river. He can't cross the bridge, it's broken. All units, stop him at the base. No firing! No firing. No one fires, we need to catch him alive. All units close-in, but no firing. I repeat, no firing. Don't let go! Never! He's going for the bridge? All units, move in. Move! Move! Move! Shoot! Shoot! Some very disturbing news coming in. IG Srikant Mathur's kidnapped daughter Radha Mathur.. ..and her kidnapper Sooraj Kaushik's bodies haven't been found yet. It's believed that the police opened fire.. ..in order to save Radha Mathur, and Sooraj was killed in the fire. Shut up! No! No! You made this personal. IG. Only four days left. He'll never make it to the court. IG's downfall... will start with his death. That sister's awake! That sister's awake! The boy... He's still unconscious. 'Lord Buddha, I want to take an oath.' 'Make Sooraj better, please.' 'And I will forsake all my bad habits.' 'I'll stop eating non-veg. I'll stop being short-tempered.' 'Never ever use bad-words again.' 'I promise.' 'Drinks... Fine, I'll quit that too.' 'And as soon as he gets up, I'll tell him..' I love you! But I could never say it because of your attitude. Stupid. But I have decided. When you're conscious, I... How long have you been listening? From "I love you". What..? Sorry, sorry. "I can live in your footsteps." "I can live with your love." "If you can't be mine.." "I will live in your heartbeats." "Why does your heart keep looking at me?" "Like it has conquered both worlds." "Since I found you..." "I... lost my heart... I lost my heart." "Since I found you..." "I lost myself." "There's love between us... so why is there a void." "I can neither touch you nor turn back." "I dwell in you... yet I don't exist." "I can't stop... or continue ahead." "Let's go somewhere far..." "there's just you and me in each other's arms." "I... lost my heart... I lost my heart." "Since I found you..." "I lost myself." "I... lost my heart... I lost my heart." "Since I found you..." "I lost myself." "I lost myself." "When I look into your eyes.." "I try to hide from my own sights." "There's magic in your love." "It destroys me makes me whole again." "I want to walk with you till the end." "Because I've conquered both worlds." "Since I found you..." "I... lost my heart... I lost my heart." "Since I found you..." "I lost myself." "I... lost my heart... I lost my heart." "Since I found you..." "I lost myself." Listen, as soon as we get to Mumbai.. ..you must come home with me. I've to introduce you to dad. The thing is... I never hide anything from my dad. So I'll tell him everything about us, as soon as we get there. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Everything will be fine. And anyway, he wants me to marry some police officer. So why don't you talk to your dad right now? We still have 2 hours before the flight takes-off. Oh wow! I thought you'll be giving your usual.. .. "this is not possible" speech again. Hello. Hello, sister-in-law. Radha. Yes, it's Radha. Mom. How are you? Where are you? I am fine, sister-in-law. But that officer, he's wounded. Officer? No one sent any officer? Sister-in-law, the security team.. ..that's been protecting me for two weeks. They aren't protecting you. They are Pasha's men. They kidnapped you. Listen... you just do something. "The dreams that I saw..." "they trickled down my face.." "as tears." "As the mirrors shattered, reality hit me Why don't you tell me now?" "Am I your hero?" "Am I your hero?" "Am I your hero?" "Am I your hero?" Trying to run away? Why did you come back? Even after you know everything. What you want is impossible? Do you love me? Sooraj, I need an answer. Do you love me? I know you love me, just tell me the truth. Truth! You want to know the truth. You want to hear it from me, don't you? Then listen. I deceived you. I am not a police officer! I don't care. Just tell me you love me. Radha... How can a goon love the IG's daughter? Have you lost your mind? Don't you have any brains at all? When you were born did your neighbors say.. "Congrats, it's a Goon." Radha, I kidnapped you. I am a goon now. If I get caught, I'll be jailed. Did you calculate how long you'll be jailed for? Look... 2 years for kidnapping. Anything else? No. Cool... then just press Alt+Ctrl+Delete. What? Delete your past. Surrender yourself. Radha, I.. Do you love me? Suryakant Pasha Ranade has now also been charged with.. ..kidnapping and murdering IG Srikant Mathur's daughter.. ..Radha Mathur, who's been missing for few days. Will this be Pasha's last day in the open air? Dheeraj. Yeah, Ruchi. Radha. Call IG sir. What happened? Dad, Ruchi just called. Radha is alive. She just talked to her. Yes. Sooraj! Sooraj! Sooraj, let's go. Come on, Sooraj! Sooraj! Radha. Radha, look at me. Alt+Ctrl+Delete! Everything changed, right? Radha... I am only joking. Just tell them, Sooraj. Tell them whatever they want to know. It will all be fine. No, Radha. I'll keep my promise that I made to you. But you don't make new relations by breaking the old ones. What's your relation with Pasha? Why are you saving him? He's a criminal. He's my papa! Sooraj. He's in police custody. The IG is interrogating him personally. I took care of him for 14 years.. ..but, it took him only 14 days too.. Bad days will come. Ms. Public Prosecutor, please call your first witness. My Lord, the State calls Ms. Radha Mathur to the stand. I'll speak only the truth... and nothing but the truth. I want to say that... Sooraj is innocent. My Lord, the witness has turned hostile. We turn to statement. Order! Order! I was kidnapped. My Lord, witness turning to hostile. We need a fresh statement. Sooraj kidnapped me. But he protected me for 14 days. Sooraj surrendered on my advice! He wants to reform. Start a new life. And maybe... if you can.. Give him one chance. If you slapped me because I hurt you, then I am sorry. But if you slapped me because I Love Sooraj.. ..then hit me again. Bela... your daughter has grown so sensible. Find someone who would be willing to marry your daughter. Ranvijay Shekhavat. He was my junior in college. He belongs from a big family in Rajasthan. These days he's in Paris, completing his MBA. Last year he came to India, for the college reunion. And met Radha. And mom, he often asks about Radha. I think he likes her. And Radha's going to Paris for her course. They both can meet out there. And if everything goes right.. Ruchi, what do you.. Dad, I was telling mom that this is Ranvijay Shekhavat. He was my junior in college. Dad, Radha has to go to Paris. To forget all this. To forget him! Brother, I can't believe you're doing this. I've been lying since we were kids to save you. And I did it again today. So what? Yeah, but.. Radha, don't worry about Ranvijay. He's a prince of Rajasthan, you're never going to find him. And I've no clue about where he is. Yeah, I do know he's not in Paris or India. So just go to Paris. Brother.. Listen... Listen... Sorry, sorry. Sit, sit... Radha, listen to me. Sooraj's been jailed for two years. During this time, if some other boy agrees to marry you.. ..then what will you do? Run away? Write a suicide note? Radha, please understand. We need some time. You know that dad is stubborn like you. And these days he isn't even talking to you.. ..let alone understand you. But two years later, things are going to be different. So if you want this Love story to work.. ..then buy yourself some time. Go to Paris, listen to me. Just go to Paris. Sooraj.. Rathodi said you came to say bye. Look, Sooraj, brother says I should go to Paris. He thinks if I go away I will forget all this. Forget you! But Sooraj, he doesn't know that I've promised myself. The day you're released.. ..I'll be waiting outside. Sooraj, I can never forget you. Nor can your dad, Radha. This jail isn't what's keeping us apart.. ..it's the reality of our life. And the truth is, Radha... your world is completely different. How can I be a part of it? Your brother is right. You should listen to your brother and your family. And you should listen to your heart, Sooraj. Hey Sooraj... at least give me a smile. Or the last thing I'll remember will be your crying face. I miss you, dad. Keep in touch, dear. Everything will be fine. "O beloved your memories torment me." "Brings tears to my eyes." "I cry alone." "Sitting under the moon all night." "O beloved your memories torment me." "Brings tears to my eyes." "I cry alone." "Sitting under the moon all night." "O beloved your memories torment me." "Brings tears to my eyes." "Without you, my heart doesn't beat." "Without you the heart's restless." "The tears trickle down my chest." "I swear on you, the tears don't dry up." "You know..." "and so do I." "What this is..." "it's the mistake made by our hearts." "You know..." "and so do I." "What this is... it's the mistake made by our hearts." "I am innocent." "But we're separated now." "I hope this separation doesn't kill us." "O beloved your memories torment me." "Brings tears to my eyes." "I cry alone." "Sitting under the moon all night." "O beloved your memories torment me." "Brings tears to my eyes." "Without you, my heart doesn't beat." "Without you the heart's restless." "The tears trickle down my chest." "I swear on you, the tears don't dry up." "Brings tears to my eyes." Sooraj! Sooraj! Seeing their good behavior in jail.. ..the court pardons six months punishment of.. ..Anand Gangopadhyay, Salim Amer, Mangesh Puranik.. ..Balichandra Rathodi and Sooraj Kaushik.. ..and releases them on parole. Alt+Ctrl+Delete! Now my new life begins. With you. The food in Paris must be so bland, right? Mom, their food might be bland.. ..but other things are quite hot. Meaning? Don't be too innocent. I mean... Ranvijay. Isn't he hot? We know all about your Love story. By the way, your dad likes him as well. When is he coming? He'll be here. Please layout the food. Yes. Go on. You'll get ice-cream as well. Ruchi, let me see the biryani as well. You go too. Before you start Losing it, I must tell you. I had no other option. Every day I would narrate some chapter.. ..out of a cheap romantic novel to dad. I told him that he wants to marry you, and.. ..even you're seriously considering him. You're not listening, are you? You're thinking about Sooraj and dad. You'll do what you've already decided, right? Introduce Sooraj to dad. When? Now. Hey mister, is someone dead? I've promised Radha! Sooraj! Sooraj, get up! So this is your Radha. Sooraj, I know you promised me that you want to change.. ..but he will kill you. Sooraj, get up. Sooraj, fight back. What Sooraj? He won't get back! Let me finish him off first. Later you can take his body. I'm telling you, Sooraj. This is all because I broke my vow. I swore not to eat non-veg. But in Paris... I had to eat it. And since I was missing you, I also had couple of drinks. I never stopped using bad words. Everything's going wrong. Even dad still thinks that.. That I am a goon. It's really difficult, Sooraj. I promised you. As soon as I get a job. What will you do, Sooraj? There are only two things I can do. Bossing people... and exercising! My days of bossing people around are over, thanks to you. But... body building.. "Oh damsel.." Darling, why you brought me to gym? You're my Mr. Right. But I need your body tight. Let's not fight. Come, beautiful, let's sweat it out together. I mean... let's sweat it out. Just... saying. What happened? Plan change, baby. Welcome, BBM sir. Your friends? BBM sir, you want to join our gym? No, no, we took a wrong turn. We want to make a body, not break it. Let's go.. Why BBM? This place is so cool. Yes, yes, place is very cool. But people are very hot. Let's go, baby. Sir... everything has changed. Don't worry.

Why so serious? You don't get it too, do you? Forget it. Radha. For the last two years.. For the last two years she's been waiting for the day.. ..when she holds your hand and proudly tell our family and dad.. ..that this is Sooraj. My Sooraj. Congratulations. Thank you. Shall we? Yes. Baba ka Akhada. (GYM) Your gym is rocking. Thank you, sir. No, sir. Call me brother. Okay, sir. Sorry. Sir? Sooraj. Just a minute. Please. I must admit, Radha. You really proved it. But I must confess one thing. Two years ago, when I asked you to go to Paris, I.. You thought I will forget him.. ..and that will be the end of my Love-story. No, of course not. Brother, you're lying? Yes. But there's only one thing that needs to end. The Ranvijay Shekhawat. Ranvijay Shekhawat. This 10 million is the boss' share. Will you pay the remaining 100 million here, or at the graveyard? Take care. Bye. Okay, bye. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Ranvijay. Ranvijay Shekhawat. Yes. Hi, I am Ruchi. Dheeraj's wife. Dheeraj Mathur, Velem's Boys. Batch of 2000. Say hi. What say hi? Come on, take my blessings. What? I admit you two aren't married yet, but still I am your sister-in-law. Come, let's go home. Come...

Ruchi's calling. She can't wait. Hello. The prince of Rajasthan is here. Ruchi, who are you with? Ranvijay? Ranvijay? Ruchi, where is Ranvijay? He's with me, and I am taking him home. Sister-in-law, please don't take him home. Ruchi, I can see you. Please stop the car, Ruchi. Please... stop the car. Sit... sit... I'll tell you everything. Sit... Dheeraj.. What happened? Can you please tell me something? I think he's gone mad. Now you want to make Ranvijay a part of your lie. I was pulling his cheeks. I was pulling his cheeks? You're worried about your cheeks.. ..Dad's going to strangle me for sure. How Long? Dad.. My dad taught me. I used tag along as his caddy. He plays golf. Dad, I want to talk to you? Yes. In private. You talk to dad every day. Let Ranvijay speak today. Aunty, what would you like to know? Dad, Ranvijay... Wait. Yes. Radha, come and sit. She's a bit upset. She must have made different plans for introducing you to us. She's a bit stubborn. Like her dad. There's no other flight. I think we'll have to cancel. Call Sheila, she will understand. Sir, please don't.. Not, sir. Call me dad. Dad! Bye, mom. Bye, dad. Sister-in-law. Ranvijay, thank you. No thank you, tell me how did I become a part of this story? Actually... You became a part of this story.. ..so that my dear brother realizes that the truth always shows up. And the truth is.. Sooraj, my boyfriend. Aah... let me guess. Dad... doesn't like him. Right. And you needed some time... so this lie. The fiancé, Ranvijay Shekhawat, someone dad likes. You must be getting late, my car will drop you. No, no, I am sure... my car followed me. I see. Best of luck with... What's his name? Sooraj? Right. Lucky boy. Yes, he went inside the house. Hold on. What are you Looking at? Walk faster, or I'll be out of here. And if I get out of here, your boss will permanently disconnect you. Understand? Time is money, you know. You ran off with our money. Now you're here to borrow some time. You have only five minutes, tell us how you're going to return our money. Tell us how you're going to return our money. Believe me, sir. I am the tragic end in Sooraj and Radha's life. I'll create chaos in their Love-story.. ..that Sooraj will regret the day he left you and chose Radha. Wow! And you want me to excuse your Loan of 125 million rupees. No, no. No, you'll give me 250 million instead. That our scores will be settled. Wow! You really are a rascal. Nothing will be fine. You shouldn't have lied. Look, Radha. I know it's difficult to convince IG sir. But I tried my best. I surrendered. Went to jail. Found a job. I did everything. And what will you say in excuse of this lie? Sooraj.. Radha, please! How Long will we keep lying to others and ourselves? Sooraj, you know.. I don't want to hear anything. You know I didn't lie to anyone. Do you have a better idea? No, right? So then fine, Sooraj. It's over. Good she left. Good riddance. What? What? What? What? Stop bothering him. This charade should've ended Long ago, get it? And Look Sooraj, we had decided Long ago.. Let me speak! Salim, we don't want anyone pointing fingers at us. Right. And Look Sooraj.. Sooraj. Shut up! All of you. You can go if you want? Go back to the filth. She considers you all a friend, and you're talking nonsense about her. Radha is ready to fight with the world for us. And you want to leave her. I am telling him to leave her? You left her. You let her go. She's not a girl, she's an express. She'll disappear over the horizon. Go on. Go. Run. Go on. Go. Run. Run. She must be rehearsing. Did it hurt? It did. Why you.. Do you know what's today? Madam, do you know what's today? It's Valentine's Day. Lover's Day. Remember. Do you know what one does today? You hold your Valentine's hand, Look into her eyes, and... Happy Valentine's Day. It's not Valentine's Day today. Fine, then... Happy Dry Day. Happy Friday. Happy Every day. Because when you're with me, it's happy every day. Sorry. Sometimes I feel like someone gives me a tight hug and says.. Everything will be fine. Promise? I promise. Amazing, wow! You're making promises to my bride. I've already committed to marry her. In French. I mean... if you don't mind, in French. And Radha, you forgot everything. Those evenings in Paris. The stars were in the sky. And you... were in my arms. It was a similar ambiance like this one. The beautiful countryside. Candle. Red wine. And me! Ranvijay. All said... all heard. Actually, there's been a deceit. The only reality was the moment when you were mine.. Only mine. Ranvijay. And end scene. How was my performance? Thank you for the dance. I was just.. I know... joking. Sooraj, right? Radha's reality... which can't be revealed. And you're Ranvijay. Radha's lie, which cannot be hidden. Are you done? Have you finished saying what you wanted? Did you finish doing? Why did you come here? I already thanked you. And anyway, I don't need a jerk like you. I am going to tell dad everything tomorrow after my performance. I only Love Sooraj, understand. And no one can separate us. Thanks again you dork-faced Muppet! Can't you women ever be punctual? Huh! We'll be late for Radha's show. Ranvijay. Dheeraj was saying you're out of town.. You should try wearing a sari someday. Why don't you trying draping a sari someday, and you'll know.. Look here. See... didn't I tell you. Keep giving pleasant surprises like this. I am here to give you all a shock, not a surprise. Ranvijay! What do you mean? Sooraj and Radha still.. What's he saying? Hello, Radha.. "Without you life is like... a soulless heart beating in my body." "How do we explain to the world... what Love is?" "Let's do something... in the path of Love.." "even if we separate tomorrow, we die without each other." "O Lord... tell me what lies in our fate." "We... we only Loved each other." "O Lord... tell me what lies in our fate." "We... we only Loved each other." "Today the colors have been drained from our lives." "Two fates are shattering in our hands." "The world won and our Love Lost." "I never imagined we'll ever be separated." "O Lord... tell me what lies in our fate." "We... we only Loved each other." "O Lord... tell me what lies in our fate." "We... we only Loved each other." Lovers are never afraid. Those who are afraid.. ..never fall in Love. Dad! Why did you have to humiliate me so much? I understood everything out there. I won't stop you. You go, Radha. Just a minute, IG sir. Is this what you want? I am ready to take you along? But can you go with me? Can you forgive yourself? I told you... A IG's daughter.. ..can never Love a goon. "I can stop breathing.." "but.." "I cannot..." Let me go. "part ways with you ever." "If the world doesn't understand.." Just one more thing, sir. "But you made me realize." I might go away... but I will only Love her. Stop me if you can. "Yes, I your hero." "Yes, I your hero." "Yes, I your hero." "Yes, I your hero." I want my honor back. "Yes, I your hero." I, Srikant Mathur. Disgraced Officer. Who gives a damn about it, dad. I care a damn! I do. And you came to advocate him... that Sooraj. To say that he's completely reformed. And that he Loves Radha. If that's true.. Listen.. If it's true, tell him to go to the Police.. ..and tell them everything about Pasha. Tell him to be the state witness. Yes. State witness? Sooraj, Pasha can be jailed only if you testify against him. Sooraj... I supported you in every way to help you reform. And what I am asking of you, is only for my dad.. Dheeraj. IG sir wants to put a price-tag on my Love.. ..by making me the state witness. He wants me to handover papa in return for Radha. This is not Love, it's a business deal. And I am sorry, I won't make my Love into a business deal. Sooraj. Radha's truth. And I am the lie. To keep this lie alive, truth has to die. Keep it. Your goodbye gift. Pasha sir, your Sooraj was planning to become the State Witness.. ..against you, for the IG. I've gift-wrapped him for you. Our deal's complete. Don't forget my money. Sooraj Baba... I know that Love made useless. But it made you a traitor. Traitor. State witness. Against your father. Pasha, show me the money. I've to catch a flight. Sooraj. Your IG's playing games, isn't he? He wants a witness, doesn't he. I'll give him a witness. A witness that will hate him all her life. Sooraj! Spit on him. Sooraj! Where are you going? Come here. Leave me. Shut up. Of course, Radha, we will let you go. So you can tell your dear father.. ..the consequences of betrayal. Betrayal? Sooraj can never betray you? He can.. Shut up. I saw him making a deal with your brother. He was going to be the state witness against, Pasha. Stop lying. And you believed him? Why you.. Sooraj chose to get beaten up. Sooraj chose jail. Sooraj chose to leave me. Because... Sooraj chose only you. You stopped considering him a son. But he... still considers you his father! Father... Stop it! Family... Bloody drama. Stop it. You will drive me crazy. My father... my son.. He left me... he deceived me.. Open the suitcase. Up, up... come on. Come on. Good! You made a big mistake. Guess both father and son are foolish. Changezi. Pasha's men are after Ranvijay. And he was last seen in Suraj Kaushik's gym. Sooraj! What did you say? Sooraj! Sooraj is dead. See. Oh... he's still breathing. So let's complete this task first. We'll turn you into corpses first. In the name of the Father, the Son... Keep it. Your return gift! Sooraj! If I had pressed this trigger two years ago.. ..then I wouldn't be Looking at the biggest mistake of my life. You can deceive the entire world, Sooraj, but not me. Because you know... I know people like you. You people never change. Your life... your upbringing. Blood doesn't run through your veins, crime does. Dad.. No, Radha. Let him speak. He's been humiliated. People made fun of him. But he never said anything. What were you saying, IG sir. Crime runs through my veins, right. I am a goon that loves an IG's daughter. If protecting your love is a crime, then I am a goon! I am a goon! I know Radha means the world to you. But you're not ready to accept that Radha can love someone like me. And you want to save this man.. He wants to destroy your world. You're proud of yourself, your uniform.. ..but I want to say something. There's not much difference between us, sir. You want to protect your love, and I my love. We're not different, sir, we're just against each other. Sooraj... So Sooraj... aren't you going to laugh today? Here's the gift for your marriage. I'm giving you my boy. He maybe a fake ..but he's useful. Keep it safe. Dad... My son. Dad... please press Alt+Cntrl+Delete. What's Alt+Cntrl+Delete? You tell him. It means... let's Restart. Let's start a new life, sir. No sir... Call me Dad. "On the pages of my eyes..." "I wrote a hundred times." "The love that I had..." "was hard to convey." "I am upset with myself, why am I speechless?" "My silence is my punishment." "My heart thinks... but I still don't know." "How do I tell you?" "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I walked every step with you on this journey." "Though were held hands, yet there was a void between us." "The feeling of love dwelling inside my heart, listen to them, without me having to convey." "My heart thinks... but I still don't know." "How do I tell you?" "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "You're the reason... I've found a desire to live." "My efforts are... to find a place in your heart." "I want to be only yours." "Can't live without you... that's all I ever prayed for." "My heart thinks... but I still don't know." "How do I tell you?" "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." "I am your Hero." <font color="#ffff80"><b>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</b></font>
