Sabarwal International school.. ..is one of the top five schools in India. Straight  and one.. Our teachers are not just from India.. ..they come from abroad too. Very good  now put your hands down. The motto of our school is.. Education is the Birth Right of every Child. Very nice. - But.. I cannot help you with your nephew's admission. I mean... Look at this. You can forget about fifth grade. According to our school standards.. ..we cannot admit him in second grade either. Look at him. He's only interested in playing video-games. Sorry  sir. Whenever Bittoo's nervous  he starts playing. Since his parents demise  he's got only two supports. Rimpi  and that PSP. He's completely addicted to it. But  don't worry. I'll personally do his homework and projects. Like all other parents. Just.. admit him in your school  Mr. Principal. What's this? Gift for sister-in-law. - What nonsense! Get out! Get out! Not out  look in. In! There's more. Rascal! You dare try to do a Sting operation on me. You think you're some kind of a hero. Who sent you? You will be the star tomorrow  sir. When you'll have more media people running after you.. ..than Aamir Khan. 'Kabootar'! - 'Kabootar?' Hey  what are you doing? Good morning  sir. Good morning. Why do you follow me? Why do you pull me back? Why are you after me? Come face me  and I'll slap you hard. Everyone say with me. Play on. Play on. You'll face the music. Yes  you'll face the music. You eat my bread and snap at me! You look like a dog. If you come back  I'll slap you again. Everyone say with me. Play on. Girlfriend tells her boyfriend to quickly remove her top. Boyfriend says okay. Play on. - And then girlfriend tells her boyfriend.. ..to now remove her skirt. Boyfriend says okay. Girlfriend scolds and says... Dare you wear my clothes again! It's either this guy or that.. just play on. Play on. Here or there  just play on. Play on. It's either this guy or that.. just play on. Here or there  just play on. Play on. Play on. Sukhi! Did you get admission? When are the exams? Sooner than you expect The principal's right behind us with the exam sheets. Let him come. Balloo. Gun! Is he a principal or a shooter? Balloo! Sukhi  are you having fun? It's just like when we used to.. ..flee from Agarwal's house with the noodles. But  Agarwal never fired at us. This way. - Stop. Stop  you rascals. There you go  mom. Our local cable's ready to broadcast breaking news. Shall I press the button? - No  'Kabootar'. This game's all about 'timing'. This goes on air only when I get the message from Ballu. Wait. Rascals! Come out! You think you can make breaking news out of me. Rascals! You don't know who I am. Mr. Sethi  we're your true admirers. And  we want to make you famous. If you don't believe us  call your wife. - Wife? What did you two did with my wife? Lover-boy. When you don't do anything with your wife.. ..what do you expect us to do? Dance? Stop firing.

Fine  we'll stop this nonsense. You can ask your wife to check again. What do you want? - 500 million. 500 million? - In cash. I don't have that kind of money. You rob the parents in the name of education. And now you say you don't have the money. You guys must have made around 700-800 million.. ..with admissions and donations alone. We're only asking for 500. Please believe me. I might have around 150 to 200 million  in cash. 300 million  final. - Look.. That's a small price for Sabarwal's reputation. Yeah. And  the admissions are still going on now. This scandal can cost you dearly. What's the guarantee that you won't make copies? Mister.

You should've seen the look on the principal's face. He couldn't understand.. ..why the police's taking his 300 million? Whose plan was it after all? Ballu the great  with my aunt's blessings. By the way  did you take a course in acting as well? You see  when your life's on the line.. ..the worst actor can give the best performance. Don't worry  brother. I am there. The 'Biryani's' ready.

It was an order for a grand wedding. The food was so delicious  I brought it for you. The mince-meat's really tasty. - Yeah. Kailash kept stirring it for two hours. You know. It's still a little uncooked. Should've let it cook some more. Nonsense. Thank God! We were successful in our plan. And it was a big victory too. We got the money  and video evidence against Sethi. After all  who made the film? - The film's yet to be made  son. We just managed to sum-up 300 million. We need 1.2billion more. Think. I know you don't like this. If you were alive  you wouldn't have let us do this. Remember  you would always catch me cheating in rummy. But  Mr. Baweja.. ..some mess can be cleaned only by crooked ways. We don't have another choice. Ravinder Baweja's an asset for our bank. He's our pride. Mr. Baweja. On this occasion  I would like to say that.. ..I want this bank to be for the middle-class  and common man. Where they can keep their money safe.. ..and earn good profit. Thank you. Sir  according to this scheme.. ..how can we give 15% for three months of cash deposit? Don't worry about the interest. Try to lock as many people you can in this scheme. What if someone wants to pay by cheque? No  Saira. This scheme's for the lower-income group. And  most of their income's in cash. This is why Mr. Sabharwal's opened.. ..a separate title account for this scheme. And  you two are the signing authorities. Here you go  Mr. Baweja. I had a small flat in Dwarka. I sold that and brought 900 000 for you These are some of my savings. Take these. The scheme certificate. Saira Madam. What can be a bigger assurance.. ..than Mr. Baweja himself. The scheme's doing really well. Mr. Gupta  these are the investor's money. Tally them and keep them safely. So  what were you up to till 4 am in the morning? Nothing. I've nothing to do. Is this the time to come home? If only you had approved my loan.. ..I would've come home on time. You're drunk. Go on. Get some sleep. - No  I want to say this. If he had approved my loan.. ..I wouldn't be installing cable-connections in Dariyaganj I'll hang you by those cables wires. Useless. Drunkard. I will. I will drink every day. I don't want to do this job anymore. You can do anything you like. But don't ever come back to this house drunk again. Fine  I'm leaving Delhi. - Stop  son. Don't go. Sukhi. You had to say it. Sukhi.

Where is our money? Will we get our money or not? We want to know. Mr. Baweja  what should I do with this? It's been five months. When will we get our money? Mr. Chadda  please calm down. - Why? The bank will return everyone's money  with interest. Interest? No  no  no.. We don't want any interest. We just want our money back. Has the cat got your tongue? Just tell us.. Sir  you're handing us over to the police. We deposited 1.5 billion of the investors.. ..in the title account  on your orders. What money? What title account? What are you saying  Mr. Baweja? Mr. Gupta  why don't you say something? You know I gave you the money. Yes  Mr. Gupta. Go on. Sir  he didn't give me any money. Sir  they are lying. - What? Baweja. Fraud  cheating with the bank. I've been serving this bank for 30 years You know my honesty.. - Shut up! You can say whatever you want at the police station. Take them away. Come on. - Listen to us  sir.. - Come on. What's going on here? Why are you making a racket? Mr. Sabharwal. Hello  sir My employees Baweja and Saira swindled your money. You won't get them back.. ..by making a racket in the bank. I want you to go and lodge an FIR against them at the station. But  still.. - Our money.. Quiet! Come on. - Leave. Who's going to return our money now? - Yeah  Who? The bank has washed their hands from this matter. - Right. Where's our money? They can't just disappear. My name's Chadda. - We will not let take our money. Look. There he is. Here comes the thief's son. Okay. - Let him come. We'll make him pay. - Right. We gave him our hard earned money. They can't take our money. I am sure  Mr. Baweja. You didn't do anything wrong. Mom  I want to say something. I never said this before.. ..how much I loved him. I know he always yelled at me. But  I always respected his principals. By God  we'll clear his reputation. Cheers for marriage  health and wealth. - Cheers. I've made the best arrangements for the wedding. Mr. Sabharwal  I feel that's expected. You see  today's television star.. ..and the future film star  that's my son Aman. Right? Mr. Sabharwal  I feel like you've found a gem. Do you see the ethics I imbibed in him? I asked him to get married  and he said yes instantly. You see  he has 2000 friend requests pending on Facebook. And  from girls. But you see  brother. I will fulfill my promise. Reception  in Taj Mumbai. Honeymoon in Europe. And  1.5 billion  they're all ready. You've just one daughter. You're bound to do that much  right? Yes. You're right. Once daughter's married.. ..then  I've a few more responsibilities. Once they're dealt with.. ..life will be really peaceful. Sabharwal  don't worry. We still have a long way to go? Which way? Shall I get the car? Why don't you explain him? Try to understand what I am saying. You didn't hear what I said. You see  I am trying to say.. ..once my sister becomes the cabinet minister.. ..then  just watch. I'll get that bank case dismissed completely. As far as your files are concerned. I'll get them cleared in a snap. You.. made me so happy by saying that. Really.. On that note  he'll tell you a joke. Go on. Sir  which one? Just tell him a joke. - Yes. Message..

And  send that dairy to Jenny. Tell her that I sent her a gift. But  ask her not to open it as long as I don't get there. Tell her I'll be at her place tonight. Are you Mr. Sabharwal's brother-in-law? First cousin from mother's side. Oh Mother.. - What happened? Don't complain about this to your brother-in-law. - I see. It won't affect this madam.

I'm with Mr. Sabharwal. I'll be right there. Okay? Of course. We'll definitely meet. Who was he? - Raman came with the fridge  so he was with him. And  those two guys are exchanging the fridge right now. I never ordered any replacement. Who is it? - They're there in the kitchen? Where? Who is it? Hey! Close the door. Hey! Open the door. Thank God! Brother-in-law! Yes. Rascals. I would've lost 500 million because of you. I've delivered your fridge  with balloon. Shut up! Balloons! The raid on the dairy was a fake. - What? Fake? Find out who they were? No wonder Sood left so soon. What's happening? Yes. Yes. But.. the money's safe. But  what's happening with me? You're going through a bad phase. The planets are not in your favour. Do something  please. Stay quiet until Gudiya's marriage. The wedding day's auspicious. Arrange for a feast and donation to 101 Brahmins before the marriage. You'll be rid of all problem's  Sabharwal. Okay. Mom  I did tell him that.. ..you trust that Manpreet too much. Mintu was right there. Ask him. Ballu  shut up. I wonder how Sabharwal turned up there. Otherwise  we would've finished the job. What do you mean how? Whose job was it to keep an eye on him? She was given just one job. But  she couldn't do that either. Let's forget what happened? At least we got our hands on 1.5 million. You can use that to buy stuff for your catering business. That's what it's good for. And him  lover boy. She'll set things right. Do you see now? I say chuck Manpreet out of this plan. Why chuck her out? Calm down! Calm down! We need to think what next? What else? I'll round up some boys. We'll rob the rascal at gunpoint. - No abusing here. Are you crazy? - Why? Because  we aren't professional dacoits. Taking our own money is not stealing. Like this? And  what if we're jailed after this. Who is going to explain him that? Okay  then you can do whatever you think is right. I am going. Ballu. Stop  son. - Bye! Ballu. Inspector Valli called today. The investors are after our lives. If we don't return them our money.. ..then we'll all be out on the streets. Nonsense! Look. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. I'm only worried about aunt. Look after her  please. And.. ..you too. Saira. I'll get you out of here soon. You two only find faults with me. What about Sukhi  who's ruining the entire plan.. ..for the sake of love? No point in fighting amongst ourselves  Ballu.

You've been duped big time. The money  for which you're getting married.. ..has disappeared from the bag. Forget the movie. You can't even make an ad film now. Check the bag before the nuptials.

Even I would like to know where my money is. Let's go inside and talk. Sabharwal  let's talk here. In front of everyone. And  where's the money? - The money.. You saw the money yourself  and.. Bagga! Bagga! Bagga! Bagga! Where's he? He was supposed to look after the money. Where is he? What's happening with me? Don't act innocent  Sabharwal. You wanted to trick us into the marriage.. With your average daughter.. - Hey! Shut up! Don't you dare say a word about my daughter. Or I won't spare you. - Brother-in-law's right. We've seen many TV stars like you. No need to endure anymore humiliation  brother-in-law. Hey you  TV Star. You and your guests just get the hell out of here! Stop this nonsense. Enough of this sham. Dad  the wedding's cancelled. Get out of here. - Wait. The wedding's definitely cancelled. Let me talk to him. Sabharwal. Hansal Mehta had already told me.. ..that you're a big fraud. But  I cannot believe you can stoop so low.. ..and cheat in your own daughter's wedding.. - Shut up! Rascal! Shut up  you rascal! Shut up! Do you know who you're talking to? Sabharwal! This is my empire! Who's this Mrs. Hansal? Tell me. Who knows me better? Who is it? Tell me. I am not Mrs. Hansal Mehta. Who are you? - Jasbeer Baweja. Ravinder Baweja's wife. Oh? Can't understand  Sabharwal? Wait a minute  aunt. We'll explain him with little jolts. We tricked the principal of your school Sethi.. ..and robbed you of 300 million. 'What brings you here?' 'You didn't visit the school for a long time..' '..so  I just wanted to see if you're okay.' And then  we raided your dairy as well. 'Brother-in-law  there's a problem.' 'There's been a raid at the dairy.' The video-recording has already been delivered to the police. And then  we made you dance to our tunes.. ..to take your money. Manpreet! Rascals. You don't know who I am. We know who you are. My father lost his life because of you. And sister-in-law Saira's still in jail. I am Sukhwinder Baweja  Ravinder Baweja's son. I swore to restore my father's reputation. Just like you robbed the investors.. ..and put the blame on Mr. Baweja. Similarly  we robbed you of your money. Robbed my money. Just try to take that money out of Sabharwal's house. The money's already left the farm house. And  you've personally returned.. ..the investors their money with interest. Fool. 'Come on. Please.' 'Keep moving.' Sir. How about a joke? Forget it. Today  you're the joke. Bagga  you.. You betrayed your own employer. And yes  Sabharwal's killed many Bawejas  and now.. Papa. - Gudiya  move. Move aside. Move! That's enough. I could never imagine.. ..you could do such a thing. After mom's death  you were everything for me. My hero. But you hurt me. Go away from here. Please go away. This had to happen  Sabharwal. You can't get a bigger punishment. Mr. Baweja's soul is finally at peace now. In view of all the statements and witnesses.. ..the court sentences Mohan Sabharwal.. ..to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment. 'Life didn't stop with Sabharwal's punishment. Sukhi and Manpreet got married. Granny got her free cable TV connection. Mintu's seen less cooking and more in religious parties. Ballu was always a fixer  and he still is. Kabootar got admission  without the donation. And  Bagga found a big family to tell his jokes. But  our mom's truly amazing. We've seen many super-heroes.. ..but  not a super-heroine like our mom.
