Excuse me.. Please hold the lift! Oh no! What's wrong? Hello? Hello boss? Is anyone there? What's happening? Hello! Is anyone there? Please answer the phone! Again? A ghost or a witch? What difference does it make? It's all because of you. As if I asked the ghost to scare you in your dreams! Coward! Kunal! Give me back the remote! Remote. Here you go! Let go of me! Let go of me, otherwise. Otherwise what? Shut up. What? You'll divorce me? You'll divorce me? No. I'll kiss Dhruv. Dhruv? Who is Dhruv? The hero of my story. A sexy ghost who sucks blood. Mosquitds suck blood too. Shut up. Go back to sleep. I've a lot of work to do. I'm sick of this. This atmosphere that you have created. Your weird lifestyle. You don't socialise. Non-stop horror movies.. Everything here from my wife to the television, is horror. It's called ambience. What? How many times do I have to tell you?! Why don't you try something else? Romance? Comedy? Why horror? Because I find ghosts damn cute. There is no such thing as ghosts. All you are doing is selling lies. When I was in the 12th grade. I had a friend at the hostel, Anita. Her life was full of problems. At home, with her boyfriend, in studies. When she came back to the hostel after vacations. She started behaving strangely. Strange? How? Like talking strangely, getting emotional. Laugh one minute then cry the next. I knew something was very weird. The next day we had our math exams. We studied through the night, on the terrace. In the morning, a friend of mine called me.. Do you know what she said? Anita had committed suicide. I couldn't sleep a wink that night. I kept staring at the ceiling fan. The ceiling fan. She hung herself from it. Have you ever seen a body of someone who has committed suicide? Bulging eyes, protruding tongue and a broken neck.. Like this! I still remember that night. Saturday. 13th June. Those were my last few days at the hostel. I was asleep one night and then all of a sudden, I woke up. You know what I saw? What? Anita. As a ghost. She was sitting by my foot. Staring at me. Then? Then? She sat there for a while. And then she left. After that, she comes visits me even] Saturday. Anita! You should an actor. That's what my publisher says too. Today is my final reading. All this ghost stuff is just nonsensical. Otherwise, why have I never seen a ghost? Kunal.. Even] fear has its moment. And your moment is waiting. Kunal! Your moment is waiting. "All we are saying is.." "Give pizza a chance." "Give me pizza!" "Don't get scared! Pizza boy coming." "Give it up!" "To the pizza boy!" "Check it out!" "He's the pizza boy!" "We'll cut the pizza, we'll all share." "You'll get some too. No one will be spared." "We'll cut the pizza, we'll all share." "You'll get some too. No one will be spared." "if no one gives you company then who will be your company?" "Have a slice and all your problems will be solved." "888844-triple zero." "Pizza boy, you are my hero!" "In the times of trouble, we must be strong." "Give me pizza." "What the world needs now is Pizza." "Joint, chillum, dope.. Have a drag." “Don't think, if you're hungry then call the pizza boy.“ "Butter chicken, pepperoni, veggie, margarita." "Give me.. give me.. give me.." "Give me pizza." "We'll cut the pizza, we'll all share." "You'll get some too. No one will be spared." "We'll cut the pizza, we'll all share." "You'll get some too. No one will be spared." Pizza is your right. Lobo! Lobo! Who are you? Quite. What's happening? A requiescat. Who is this bearded guy? I don't know. I thought he was a beggar so I told him to get lost. Then the boss came in. But I don't understand. What's going on? You don't need to know everything. Boss has his fingers in many pies. Who knows what toppings he's offered to which Gods! What do you think? He's got all this from selling pizzas? Only he knows what goes on in that cabin of his. What's going on? Yes? Get back to work! And you! How dare you call guru-ji a thief? A beggar, sir. I'll deal with you later. Go make sure he's alright. Stop staring and gawking. Get back to work. Sir.. What would you like? You took my boss's, might as well take mine too.. E r. . service. Tea? Idli (savoun/ cake)? Bananas? Pudding? Or rice and lentils? One medium veg pizza, with jalapefios and extra olives. Hey, waiten. Thin crust. Nikki! Hey, Nikki! Nikki! Come out, Nikita! Come out, Nikki! Nikki, why is my t-shirt wet? Why are you crying? Hey! Nikki! This is just great! I can't even say anything to you. Nikki.. The t-shirt I wore yesterday is wet. And today's stinks of sweat. What will I wear to work? You are at home the whole day. Can't you do one small thing for me? Don't give me an excuse of being a writer. You understand? Listen to me. Please.. Look, I'm worried too. We are living off your parents' insurance money. We aren't living, just barely sun/iving. You know I want to make something of myself. And for that you'll have to be a little more responsible. Look, I am not saying that I am perfect. But at least I am careful. I am pregnant. What do we do now? What's done is done. I don't mean it that way. Did you go to the doctor? What will you do? I'll go today. What Will I do? Why is that even a question? Come on, try to understand the situation. You are a struggling writer. I am a pizza delivery boy. We both are just scraping through. Yes, but that's not permanent. No. After 2-3 years.. I'll get a promotion. I'll be a manager, my salary will triple. That will be the right time to have a child. Fine! I'll tell the baby to stay in me for three years. Nikki.. Nikki, you don't need to get emotional over everything. Can't you be practical? I'm having a baby. I have a right to be emotional. You don't want this baby, that's fine. I want it. With or without you. And you know what? I just hope our baby doesn't turn out like you. Nikki! - Shut up! "Some things unsaid.." “Some things important.“ "Lingered on the lips, through eyes there were to be expressed." "Some things unsaid.." “Some things important.“ "Lingered on the lips, through eyes there were to be expressed." “Leaving everything incomplete. .“ "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." “Unnecessary tiffs, meaningless arguments. .“ “Unnecessary tiffs, meaningless arguments. .“ “Unnecessary tiffs, meaningless arguments. .“ "With whom will I have?" "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." 'This is the last time I am ironing your clothes.' 'l am not your maid to do all these things.' 'You are good at giving lectures on responsibility, aren't you?' 'But what about you?' 'You are a scoundrel, a dog, a liar, a beguiler..' 'And all those cusses which you use when you are with your friends.' Kunal.. Kunal! Kunal.. Girl or boy? What? Girl or boy? What happened to you all of a sudden? I realised that I am about to become a father.. And that I should stop behaving like a child. What brought about this sudden realisation? I have even thought of a few baby names. Chintu, Pintu, Kamlesh, Dharmesh. Yuck. Don't be upset. A have a few female names as well. Savitri, Kamla, Sughanda, Bhanupriya. Bhanupriya? Really? It was my aunt's name. Are you sure about this? Raina, Naina, Megha.. You just wait and watch. We'll have a girl. What's the point? She'll have Malkholkar as her surname. And this will continue for nine months. I will throw a lot of tantrums and make a lot of demands. You'll have to fulfil all of them. I'll endure all your tantrums and fulfil all your demands. Cake! Chocolate cake, one box sweets. ...tamarind pickle, chicken pepper fry, poppadum, blueberry ice-cream.. Done? Anything else? Red millet chips, tomato flavour. They come in three flavours but I want tomato flavour. S ix packets. How many kids are you pregnant with? Kids can wait, daddy is calling you. Okay, love you. Bye. Don't worry, Anna. I'll take care of everything. It's my responsibility. Yes, come in. I know everything . What, sir? I heard that you are going to have a child. Yes, sir. So, where's my party, sweets? Sir, I'll keep a small party right after my promotion. Oh. Then we'll have to wait for another 2-3 years. Here, take this box home. I don't need a gift, sir. You wished me. That's more than enough. Take this to my house. Okay, sir. Go. Hello, ma'am. Sir has sent this chocolate box. Ma'am.. <i>P n'! a ma' am?</i> <i>P n'! a ma' am?</i> Anjali! My name is Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! <i>'</i> Lei 90! I.. My name is Anjali! Ma'am! Let go of him! My name is Anjali! Let go of him! What did you say to her?! Anjali! Why are you staring at me? Call her husband! Come with me, ma'am. Anjali! Ma'am.. Call her husband! Come with me, madam. Come with me.. Sir.. After how many days is this happening? Her condition had deteriorated three days back. But it was not so bad.. Priya.. Not Priya! My name is Anjali! Anjali! You are back! What do you want? Anjali.. Who are you? What has my wife done to you? Why are you troubling Priya? Did you think about the child she is carrying? What do you want? Who are you angn/ with? Tell me. Who do you wish to seek revenge from! Tell me. Get him out of here. Leave, I'll see you tomorrow. Listen.. This.. Whatever that you saw.. Please don't tell anyone about it. I don't know who this Anjali is. She's possessed my wife. I have tried everything. After so many years, with guru-ji's blessing we are going to have a child. But this Anjali.. Listen, please don't tell anyone about it. Our boss's wife's condition makes me sad. People say that she is carrying a ghost, not a child. Lobo, you never told me. What could I say? You saw his condition, didn't you? All these years he wasn't having a child.. And now when he is having a child, there's this ghost. You know Priya has done a lot for me. She's treated us like family from the day we started working here. What will the boss do now? He's left no stone unturned. There is no shrine or temple that he hasn't prayed at. Priya ma'am and this child are his biggest weakness. He can do anything to save them. If needed he will even marry the guru. Quit fooling around. I know who will take me seriously. I am not joking, Nikki. There were so many people there. Why did she look at me? Nikki! I told you, you'll have your moment. Even] fear has its moment. And your moment has come. That was your moment. One chicken supreme special, regular. Sure, ma'am. Your order will be there in 30 minutes. Thanks for calling Slices. Lobo, one chicken special, regular. Yes, sir. That's one special pizza. Kunal!

This bungalow is ominous. Ominous? Why? Bad luck follows anyone who goes inside the bungalow. What's happened in this bungalow? The couple who lived here fought all the time. The guy suspected that the child his wife was carrying was someone else's. One night, in the fit of anger, he axed his wife to death. After that. He killed himself as well. And then?

It's me, Pandey. Yes, you had called me? Yes, I had called. How are you? Fine, sir. Listen, did you get any leads on that missing girl? Nothing unusual, sir. Her parents died in an accident. She was a struggling writer.. Yes. She was having an affair with that boy and then she married him. Okay, thanks. Sir, Mr. Pandey's call. Yes, sir. I didn't get much information about the girl. But let me tell you something, Mr. Kapoor. This boy is not as innocent as he looks. I am sure he.. Sir. It's not like that sir. He loves her a lot. Nowadays people kill because of love, sir. I see this everyday. Either the boy kills the girl. Or the girl's lover kills the boyfriend. In your case, I suspect the boy. Let me keep him for a day, I'll make him confess the truth. No, sir. Let it be. Please continue your investigation. And let me know if you find anything. Okay, sir? Okay, sir. Bye. Bye, sir. Grease his palms and get more information. Got it? Come in. Are you alright? You cannot be. No, sir. I am fine. I have brought this for you from Narsovawadi. Keep it with you. It is very powerful. As long as it is with you, no one can cause you any harm. Okay, sir. Do you get scared making deliveries? That's why I don't do deliveries post 6:00pm. Okay. Last warning. I am giving you the last warning. We will break the shop tomorrow. Give me one day, please. If we don't get our thing till tomorrow, then you are gone. Trust me, you will get. What happened, sir? They will break the shop tomorrow. What...? We'll have to go there. Sir, please.

It's open. Check the bike. Sir, batch... What happened? The bag is not here, sir. It must be inside. Yes. Let's go. Come on, let's go inside. The bag, sir. Sir.. Hurry up and open the door. Hurry up and open the door. Hurry up and open the door. Kunal! Kunal! Open the door, Kunal! Kunal! Open the door, Kunal! Kunal, open.. Open the door! Open the door! Hurry up! Get in, quickly! The key.. Where is the key? Kunal, we saw.. Shut up! No one will say anything. No one will say anything. Got it? But why? What happened inside? Just shut up. Everyone keep quiet. Sir, please. Please tell me what happened in that house. Who was in that house, sir? Was it that woman or that kid? Lobo, you tell me. For our friendship's sake. Sameer, you tell me. What did you see over there? Will someone say something? Why did you go to that house! I told you not to go there. Just like that house took my Nikita from me.. It will take away something dear to you. I somehow managed to get out of there. But that house didn't leave me alone. Now I feel as if someone is always with me. Someone is staring at me, following me. When I sleep I feel as if someone is next to me. Papa! Someone is trying to talk to me. Papa! <i>'</i> Yes! No! Kunal, have you lost your mind? What are you doing, Kunal? Sir.. I beg you. Please tell me. Don't hide it from me. What did you see in that house? Tell me. Will no one tell me? At least tell me whether my Nikita will return or not. Yes? Fine. I considered you as more than friends. That was my mistake. I will find Nikita on my own. In this world or the next. I will meet Nikita. Guru-ji, please do something. Sir.. What did guru-ji say? What was common between Priya, Nikita.. ...and that woman who was murdered in that house? What? They are all pregnant. And along with that woman, the child she was carrying, also died. And it took Anjali's form. Now it has become a ghost and is hunting for a womb. And whenever it gets a chance it possesses my wife. But.. The day Nikita went to that house to help Kunal.. It possessed Nikita. Sir, does that mean that Nikita won't be coming back? You saw Nikita in that house, didn't you? Did you look at her condition? Sir, no matter what, we have to tell Kunal the truth. Yes, sir. He's looking for her everywhere. If Nikita's leaves that house, Anjali's ghost. ...will once again try to possess my wife. Look, we are going to have a child after such a longtime. And in that house whether Nikita is alive or not.. We don't even know that. And as long as Nikita stays in that ominous house.. Priya and our child will remain safe. Sir, what will we tell Kunal? I'll talk to Kunal and make him leave this place as soon as possible. That poor guy will live on in the hope that one day Nikita will come back. And if you want your sister Priya to stay safe.. Then please, don't tell Kunal the truth. Promise me. Promise me, please. But Kunal.. Whatever that needs to be done with Kunal.. Whatever needs to be told to him, I'll tell him. I am there. I am there, believe me. But.. Please help me. Come.. Come in. Are you going on a delivery? Yes, sir. Sir, I wanted to ask you a question. What did guru-ji tell you yesterday? Just that Nikita will come back soon. I, too, feel that I'll be meeting her soon. Why don't do you do one thing.. Why don't you take a few days off? You will get some rest. Right? Leave for your village tomorrow itself. Okay? But sir, what if Nikita calls? Then we will contact you. Don't worn]. Take a break from this mess. You will feel better. Okay? Okay. Here's some money. Keep it. You might need it. "You were just here, but you are here no more." "Where have you disappeared all of a sudden?" "Now it's like all my dreams have left." "Now it's like no will left in me to live." "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." "You just left me alone." You are late, my ghost. It takes time to come here from the ghost world. You better stick to horror, romance is not your cup of tea. I'll push you. Yes, tell me? What should I say? You are still there? Where else should I be? Your wife is pregnant. So it's obvious that you should be with your wife. I'm on overtime. Hurry Up- I haven't eaten anything. I am starving. I have an idea. When I send a text message, order pizzas. I'll bring them home. Sir, this is today's collections. Good evening, thanks for calling Slices Pizza. Hi, sexy. Yes, ma'am. What will be the order? A pizza boy, smoking hot. Thanks for calling Slices Pizza. Your order will be ready in 30 minutes. Lobo, one chicken special, regular. Hello? It's me. Anna. Its urgent, listen to me. Just a minute. Listen carefully. Police has arrested my man. We will get into trouble if he rats us out. They might raid your shop. Move the goods from there. What is this, Anna? You said everything will be safe. What's happening? You'll have to take a risk if you want to make a fast buck. Get it out of the shop quickly. I'll come after two days and pick it up. Kunal! Here, take this box home. My home. Sure, sir. But I have to make a deliven/.. My wife won't eat you. Here you go, it was super. Change quickly. I am starving. No. I need to go to boss's house. I need to deliver something. Chocolates! For me? Nikki, it belongs to my boss. Don't touch it. So what? I'll take a few. He won't even know. Don't irritate me. Kunal.. Uncut diamonds. They must be worth millions. Nikki, keep it back in the box, please. Nikki, please. What if we don't return them? Don't talk nonsense. I'll deliver in a few months. Don't you want our child to get all the happiness that we didn't get? Kunal, if you cannot deliver a pizza in 30 minutes then it's a waste. Life too is somewhat like that. What's the point of finding happiness when we are 50? When will we live our life? No, Nikki. I cannot betray my boss. He is a nice man. This isn't about humanity. It is about opportunity. And we will never get such an opportunity again. But how? Where will we go? Just a minute. When I don't go back to the pizza parlour, my boss will call the police. We'll have to cozen your boss. Something believable. Everyone has a weakness. He too must have one. Yes. He does. Ghost. Superstition. So that's how the story should be.. 'Not Priya! My name is Anjali!' 'I don't know who this Anjali is.' 'Priya ma'am and this child are his biggest weakness.' 'People say that she is carrying a ghost, not a child.' Good evening, ma'am. Pizzas. Good evening. According to the plan the bike will be here. You keep the pizza bag inside. Anything else? What are you doing? What happened? Whose call is it? Oh! Now what? Nikita! Help me, Nikita! Hello? Kunal? What happened? Who is it? What who? It's me. Sir? - Listen, Kunal. I called at home. That box has still not been delivered. Did you deliver the Pizza? Hello, sir.. - Where are you? I cannot get through to your number. Sir, I am stuck in that house. Hello? I can't hear anything. Kunal! Sir.. I can hear you. Hello? Hello? I wonder where he is! You two go and find him. Boss will come here for his box of chocolates. I don't know when. But whenever he comes, you be ready for him. Scare him in such a way that he never looks back at this house again. Okay? I'll see you. Good luck. Just a minute. Just a minute. Where have you been? What are you doing, Lobo? Let go of me. Kunal.. Anjali was in that house. Where are your bike and your bag? I left it at the bungalow and then I came here, sir. Look at him. He's gone crazy. Hello? Hello, Nikki? I think they are convinced. Everything is going fine. Listen, don't get out until I tell you to. What are you doing at moment? I am getting ready to welcome them. We'll have to go there. No, sir. I won't go inside. Why did you go to that house! I told you not to go there. Just like that house took my Nikita from me.. It will take away something dear to you. Here's some money. Keep it. Thank you, sir. Wow. That means we get the pizza as well as the toppings. I cannot believe that we are going to start afresh from tomorrow. Okay, I'm leaving. Be at the airport by 10:00 pm. And you? I'm going to deliver the last pizza of my life. Then run! Or they'll deduct 150 bucks from your salary. Pizza Just a minute. Hey kid, the bill. "Run! Run!" "Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!" "Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!" "Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!" "Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!" "The storm's here!" "Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!" "Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!" "The storm's here!" Papa.. It's my birthday.
