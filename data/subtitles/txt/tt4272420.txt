I just saw two beautiful angels. Hi...hi...hi...hello. You know, PP, Indian women are a completely different story. Spicy, spicy. You're already up to your antics. Look, I don't want to get into this mess. I only love my wife. Hey...even I love your wife. - What do you mean? Relax. Relax. It's his old habit. He only loves others wives. That's why I don't get married. Those who love other's wives, say no to marriage. And anyway...once you're married.. ..love gets washed down the drain. And what happens next is you going brain dead. PP...if I tell this to your wife, she will beat you. Why? Are you looking for another member for your club? Club? - Don't you know? A club for husband's who get beaten by their wife. That's him. Hold on. Hold on. Listen...does your wife beat you every day? - No, no, no. She doesn't beat me regularly. You see...last month I was giving driving lessons to my secretary. Hold on. But giving driving lessons isn't a crime? - Let me explain. This man...was giving lessons to his secretary.. ..in the office, with him sitting on his chair and her on his lap. Which means...she was driving.. ..and he was blowing the horn. - Nice. And...his wife dropped in, caught him red-handed. And since then she hasn't allowed him.. ..to park his car in her garage. No entry. Come on, PP, stop laughing. You'll be caught red-handed someday. Your countdown begins today. Not possible. My wife has no time. Hold on, PP. Sister-in-law doesn't have time, and you didn't tell me. Stupid, I meant she has no time for me. Why? What is she busy with? God! Swamiji. How are you? - All well. Come. How are you? - All well. And...did you see the horoscope? I did. All fine? Everything was fine, but now there's a problem, Mrs. Patel. - What? There's a problem. A woman. Correct. Absolutely correct. Samsya. - Who? My maid, my house-help. She comes to work for 2 days, and takes leave for three. She really bothers me. This is not about your maid. - Then. It's someone who's a threat to you. - Oh my. Some girl will soon enter your life.. ..and she'll make your life hell. Disrupt your peace. Disrupt my peace? - Yes. Will there be quarrels? - A lot. Will we fight? - You will. I know who is coming. Who? My Jigolo. - Ji.. Jigolo. My son, Jigar. - Yeah, His wife. - Wife? Jigar's a grownup now. - He has. Since when? There's a system to know that a boy has grown up. When you clean a 7 year old boy's room, you'll find comic books. Yes. If you clean a 15 year old boy's room, you'll find sports magazines. Yes. And if you find something like I did this Sunday. You know he's a grownup now. - Find what? Playboy. Scared, weren't you? I'll soon become a mother-in-law. - You will. But this problem will soon enter your life. That woman is going to trouble you a lot. And I have a solution to avert this problem.. ..which I can give to you if you want. How much do I pay you? You know me really well, Mrs. Patel. - Right. Jigar! Jigar! Jigar! Who's going to clean this up? Jigar! Jigar! Stupid, fool...I've told you a thousand times.. ..stop playing that guitar and look after the family business. Why don't you listen? Have you lost it? - Shameless, what did you say to your father? And why are you playing it so loudly? So Naina can hear it too. Naina? Where is she? Hey...idiot. Stay away from a girl who's got two Na's in her name.' Look... Na-I-Na... Naina. Dad, what's in the name? She's a friend, and she's your neighbor too. Well that doesn't give her right to bathe in my pool. Can't she bathe in her own pool? And if still wants to take a bath.. ..can't she do it like your mother. Your mother completely dressed even in the shower. And look at her. Dad, it's a free-country. In every country girls spell trouble. Oh, God! When will he listen? Moron...you haven't delivered this box to the store yet. If your mother sees this, she will bury me alive. Get this to the store immediately. Dad, stop over-reacting. And listen to this. Over-reacting.. What the hell.. Koki's religious songs. Correct...this house is hell for me. Koki. Koki.. What...are you doing, Koki? These religious songs, and the dance won't get you in heaven. And if you dislocate a bone, I'll have to call a doctor. I know.. You want me to break a bone.. ..and land in the hospital. So you can do as you please. Do as I please? Do as I please? In 26 years, I only did that once. The result is sitting up there and playing the guitar. You know, you keep playing these songs all day. Someday the counselor will serve us notice.. ..and we'll have to evacuate. Get that. Praveen Patel...I am a Patlani from Mesana. Getting me out of his house is impossible. And anyways, this is a free country. Wow! Wow! Like mother like son. "It is a free country." It's free only for you two. I never got that feeling myself. Stop grumbling and listen. There's a live Garba program at the temple tonight. Come on, Praveen, let's practice Garba. We'll do Garba all night. I even brought your favorite dress from the laundry. You like coming on TV, don't you? Garba Kokila Jackson Studio. My dear...spare me. No Garba for me. I did it once in 1985...only once. I still remember that blow to my stomach.. ..and it still bothers me every morning. You won't understand my problem. - That reminds me, Praveen. You know...some female will soon enter our family. What female? My Jigolo's wife, who else? - Yes. Anyway...I'll have to find a bride for him. You know, Patel...I am so nice. Right? - Yes...you are. Ask the Lord... I am a satisfied soul. I never demand for anything. I've a small...miniature wish. My daughter-in-law should be a Gujarati. Even better if she's from our community. She must be beautiful, cultured, educated, religious.. ..and from a good family. She should be an expert in making Gujarati delicacies. And I'll teach her the rest. You know today's generation.. Sorry...sorry.. Why are you laughing? Is Jigar crazy after someone? - He is. Naina. Look, there he is. - Jigolo. Here. Have a sweetmeat. Eat it. I am taking some for Naina. Jigar, what's this? It's not mine, its Dad's. Hey.. - Praveen. It's not for me Koki, it's for the store. Praveen...if you sell these shameless DVDs.. ..then what values will you teach him? It's just business, Koki. Just business. And anyway, he never listens to me in the first place. Here, eat it. Eat it, son. Listen. Give those to Murgados. And tell him I am coming. I am going. Don't try to be a hero in front of mom. Go or I.. Hello, aunty. How are you? Very fine, dear. Black is back, right? Very smart. But, is that all you're wearing? Where's the rest? Mom? - Sorry, enjoy...enjoy. Bye, Naina... Na...na...na...na... Patel. Who eats powder for breakfast? I'll get you bread and curd. - Let it be. You won't understand. - I don't want to either. Listen, do you know any girl of marriageable age? I do...many. - Who? But how can I get married again when you're still around? I meant for Jigar. So should I look for one? You can do anything you want, just leave me alone. Okay. Finally we're alone. Just me and.. - Go take a bath. I will. Koko-dile. Sorry. Tonight...I give you my word. Just me...you and scotch. Jigar, good morning. Good morning. Working. Hot chic. - She's okay. My dad's favorite. - I know. How do you know? Jigar, are you ready? Yeah! Just crazy, dude. It's like Pandora's box. But why are you showing me this. Actually, I need a favor. You're in the music business, right? And my passion's music as well. So if someone need's a drummer.. ..will you please refer my name. I play the drums really well. If you're such a good drummer.. ..then what are you doing in this store? Family problem, sir. I've send money to my mother every month. Fine...you can play with me in my band. We'll jam together. Really? - Yes. Thank you, sir. I won't let you down. - Okay. Oh no...sir. - Oh no, dad. Jigar, leave. Yeah...one second.. Thank you, sir. See you in the evening at the jamming. Hi, dad. - Hey fool, where are you going now? Jigu, why don't you talk to your parents? I will. - When? Once I become a superstar, I will tell everyone. Even my brother? He hates you. He doesn't like you or your music. I see. Yes. - That's a compliment for me. And anyway, it doesn't matter whether he likes me or not. Jigar, why doesn't your mom like me? Of course she likes you. I'll talk to her. When? - Soon. No! Right now. What happened? Everyone thinks that you're just fooling around. You know, baby, that's not true. I love you. If you love me are you ready to marry me? - Marriage? Yes. I want to marry you. I want to have kids. I mean I am not saying right now. But if Rambo finds out that you're serious.. ..and want to marry me, then maybe.. What the.. Rambo! There's Rambo. Go talk to him now. I won't talk to him. Later. I will talk to him later. - Later. Everything for you comes later. But.. Then you also see me later. No. - Naina. Naina, wait. Hey. - Hey, Sam. Why so furious? Jigar's lies and false promises. And his fights with Rambo. I can't take it anymore. By the way, do you love him? Of course I love him. But there are problems in both the family. What do I do? Excuse me, why do you need to care about families.. ..when you love each other? Family matters. Even I am half Indian. We should value our family. Okay, and what about Jigar? Well, Jigar... Naina. "I wonder what bond I share with you?" "Your face...dwells in my eyes." "I'm right behind you like a shadow." "There's purity in your grace." "I've left my heart at your threshold."

Ma'am may I come in. - Yes. Yes, ma'am. Did you book the ticket for Kuala Lumpur? - Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, Mac Mohanta sir is here. We need to finalize dates for his movie. Shall I call him in? - Yes.

He looks younger. - Yeah, but why is he doing this? "They can lie like an expert." "Make even their son look like his father." Do you know how expensive this salon is? - How much? 300 for a haircut. - 300. What? I still need to buy clothes. You ripped me off for a haircut, now how do you expect me to buy clothes? 300.. "Just do what you're good at." "Something's definitely wrong." "Something's definitely wrong." "Something's definitely wrong." "Something's definitely...wrong." Something's definitely not right.

Shall we begin? - Yes. Your name. Your name. - Praveen.. PP. And your age. Whatever you feel's right. Actually...I am just 35. You look like you're 45. Fine...it's neither you nor me. Let's finalize on 40, right? Naughty at 40! Will do? And...sex? Yes...will do. Why not? Stupid... Male or Female? Stupid! You know Gujarati? I do. - Me too. Amazing. They say...one should look in the eye while talking. Not somewhere else. - Yeah. Sorry. My eyes slipped a little below. Sorry. Tell me...what about 'that'? That? - Yeah. I'm putting in all this effort for 'that'. Not 'that'...I mean marriage. - Sorry. I didn't. I am a bachelor forever and ever my love. Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? You? Yes, Naina. The old man is home. The old man is home. Yes, I know the old man's at home. Would you like to talk to him? Old man? Old man who? Was your uncle here? - You. This latest shirt and new haircut doesn't make you look young. Get real! First tell me...what are you doing here? Spying. - On who? You. - Why? I've seen and heard everything, dad. Dad. Stop it, dad, are you going to finish the bottle? - Yes, so? I will finish the entire bottle, so? A man and his bottle stay together forever. Understood? You didn't? Let me explain. Which bottle do you get when you're born? Speak up? Milk bottle. - Right, milk bottle. Remember. After that, which bottle do you get at school? Come on. Water bottle. Yeah. Then, when you're a grown up...it's the beer bottle. Which you drink, I know. After that...once you're married, it's the whiskey bottle. And after you're dead, it's the bottle of holy water. Get it. It's a deep bond. Whether anyone else stays with you or not.. ..but the bottle will never leave you. Understood. My tall-legged son. Dad, stop it now. You're drunk. What... Will you hear the tragedy of my life? - Tell me. Don't misunderstand me. You see...Koki has a clear heart. But she's only interested in praying, worshipping, saints.. ..her crab-dance...and her mixed vegetables. Other than that, she isn't interested in anything else. Shanaya...is my dream girl. She's my dream girl. I want to spend one...only one day with her. So that I can live my dream. I don't like this, dad. This doesn't suit you. And I love mom. I don't want her to get hurt. Hey...even I love my Koko-dile. I'll never do anything to hurt your mother. I promise you. You won't listen, will you? Promise. Koko-dile. Years later I'm watching father and son together. Thank you O great one. He's my son, who else do you expect to see me with? Correct. Listen up. Babaji has predicted that.. ..soon some lady will be entering our family. And she's your destiny. Yes, I know. It's Naina. Yes, mom. It's naina. I'll talk to her. - What? You shut up. Naina can't be a part of this family, son. She isn't a bad girl, she's nice. But there's a big difference in our lifestyle and hers. She can't adjust. - Mom, she will manage. Trust me. She won't, you trust me. Dad, say something okay. Fine, you two go out...let me think something. Go on. Thinking won't help. Keep thinking...but not Naina. Dad, you better take care. Pen. Congratulations. Same to you, sir. Shanaya, remember one thing. I will be your best friend off set. But on the set, I am a professional. And I expect the same from you. - You won't be disappointed, sir. I am sure I won't. And remember. If you really want to give life to this character.. ..then you must live in a middle-class Gujarati family. Only then will you be able to do justice to this role. Okay. Great. Let's have a photo. Good morning, sir. You're early today. This is my store. I can come whenever I want. Right, sir. Very good. Now do as I say, and don't think too much. Something might break inside. And just do as I say. Get all the Valentine's Day forms from the other stores. Okay, sir. Next, take all the forms in our stores. And shred the entire bundle in the shredder. Don't think... or something might break. Just go. How can anyone else win when there will be no form left? So I will win. I love you, Shanaya. I'll be your hero...and I'm your villain. Shanaya, my love. We'll definitely talk in 5 minutes. Hello and welcome to the Vjon presents 'Date with a Diva' contest. For the first time in television history.. ..the winner gets a chance to go on a romantic date.. ..with his favorite superstar on Valentine's Day. And that superstar is.. The stunning, the gorgeous, the reigning queen of Bollywood.. Superstar Shanaya! Welcome to 'Date with a Diva'.. ..with yours, truly Shanaya. As you all know, I am waiting for your...call. All that later, first talk to me. You will be my date for Valentine's Day. Talk to her! Talk to her! Hello. Hello. Who's that? How did his call get connected, and not mine? I think I can't hear you. I am sorry...I guess we won't meet on Valentine's day. Get lost... Hello. Hello. Your name? - What's my name? Praveen Patel! What kind of a name is Praveen Patel? Such a rotten name. One should think twice before suggesting a name.. ..it comes with an expiry date. Hello. Can you hear me? - I can even hear your heartbeat. How sweet. You haven't told me your name yet. What's in the name, Shanaya? You can call me anything you want. If you're Shanaya, I am radish. If you're a kite, I am your solar cell. If you're a bull, I am the bell. No...I am the bull.. Sorry...I fumbled, sorry. - You're so funny. But you will have to tell me your name. - I see. I've a very outdated name, huh! Don't mind. If you don't like it, I'll change it. My name is PP. Okay, Mr. PP. Are you ready to play a game? Can I ask you a question? - Yes. My first question.. What if I wasn't an actress? Third world war. - What? Look... If you hadn't been so gorgeous, you wouldn't be an actor. And if you wouldn't have come on television. And then people like me wouldn't have fallen in love with you. And without love, I would've joined the army out of frustration. And thousands of youngsters like me.. ..would've joined their army out of frustration. Think about it. If so many frustrated people, join the army in their country.. ..it could only lead to the third world war. Oh my, God! Your line of thinking is really unique. I can never think like that. Don't think, Shanaya. Don't think. Just ask the next question and make me win. Okay, PP, my last question. If I don't go on a date with you, then what? End of the world. - What? Let me explain. If I can join the army and start a Third World War.. ..even though I don't know you. So you can imagine, after knowing you, and talking to you.. ..if I don't get to meet you, what am I capable of doing. Third World War is a small thing, I can annihilate the entire planet. Oh... Shanaya, please don't mind, but.. ..you will have to go on a date with me. Not for me, not for yourself... But, for the future of this planet. For the future of small, innocent kids. For the betterment of the entire human race.. ..you will have to go on a date with me. Please, please... PP, I've been to every city in the world. But...I never came across anyone like you. But...you haven't seen me yet. - But I will soon. Because...with your unique answers.. ..you've won my heart, along with this contest. You're the winner, PP. Hail Lord! Thank you! Thank you! Jigolo...your father did a cool Jackson style. Hello. Is PP sir in? Hello? - Sorry, ma'am. Can I.. - PP sir has won the contest. Can you please give this to him? And tell him I came down personally to invite him. Okay? By the way, what's your name? - Murgados. But you can call me Muru. Okay, Muru. Thanks for everything. You're so sweet. Bye. Hello, Mr. Patel. - Hi. Sir. Are you okay? Yes. PP? - Yes Hi. Hi.. Sorry. Hi...Hello.. Happy Valentine's Day. But I didn't get anything for you. - So what? No, this is not done. Keep this banana. It's very nutritious. I don't eat bananas. I see. - I don't like. Have a seat. I have my.. Oh, sorry. Can we talk? - Sure. You know how I feel about you. Why don't you tell me how do you find me? Well...you don't look 40. Yeah, I've always looked older than my age. Sorry...sorry. Actually, I am not 40. It was my birthday yesterday, and I turned 41. Aah...happy belated birthday. - Thank you. If I had known, I would've brought another gift. You're in front of me, what could be a better gift? No one ever made me so happy in 45 years. What? - What? You said 45. - 45? Yes. Yeah...I mean 4 to 5. - Oh. 4 to 5... No one ever made me so happy in the last 4 to 5 years. You know, PP. The other day, when we were talking on the phone.. ..you only talked about me. Today I want to talk about you. - Me? Yes. I want to know everything. Your hobbies, your interests...what do you like. Forgive me...but the truth is.. ..you're my hobby, you're the one I am interested in. Do you like films? - Yes. You know, PP, that day when we were talking on the phone.. ..I realized you've a writer's mind. Really? - Yeah. Can you help me with my film's story? Yes, why not. By the way, I've made-up many stores. I need to cook-up lies for Kokila. Who's Kokila? Who's Kokila? Kokila, who? Who's Kokila? I was talking about my mother. We address our mother as Kokila. Kokila. By the way, my mother's name is Rama. And where is she? - She passed away. Two years ago... due to a heart attack. So sad. By the way, I love such families. You know...mom, dad, brother, sister.. Complete family. Who's in your family? Problem! The old lady's already dead. I'll have to lie about the old man now. What? Like I said...my mother passed away.. ..but, my father's still alive. I live with my father. 'If you really want to give life to this character..' '..then you must live in a middle-class Gujarati family.' 'Only then will you be able to do justice to this role.' PP. - Yes. Do you want me to be a big star? - Yes, of course. You know, only you can make me a star. Me? - Hmmm. I'm supposed to play the role of a Gujarati housewife. But honestly speaking.. ..I've no experience of any Gujarati family. I have no one. And I spent all my childhood in a boarding school. I grew up away from home. You know, I never had a family.. ..which consisted of parents or siblings. You know, like a proper Indian family. - Yes. I don't have such a family. But one man can give me such a family. - Who? You! - Me? Yes. I know it's a little awkward, but.. ..can I stay in your house? You know, to learn about a Gujarati family. You, mother, father.. I mean, if you have no objection. You... You will... You will live in my house? Objection.. I need an injection, I'm going to faint with happiness. Okay.. You.. PP...in-out. Are you okay? I'll come by day after tomorrow. We'll stay together for few days. - Yes. You, me and.. - And? Your papa. My papa? This isn't a dream, PP...its reality. Shanaya's going to stay with you. What about Koki? And what about Jigar? This is a serious problem. PP, God doesn't always give an opportunity like this. Don't let this slip from your hands. You can do this! You can do this! Now watch what I do? Hey...go on. Go get popcorn, cold drink and hurry back. There's lot of confusion left ahead. See you...after the break! Hi. Myself Praveen Patel. How are you? PP! How come you're so early today? No, no, you two are late. Wait, wait.. Stop. Hi. Why did you two come so late? It's alright. Listen, while I was working out, I.. I.. I was thinking... The world... The world's made of brass. If there's anything like pure gold, then that's friendship. Our friendship. You see, PP, I'm running low on my bank balance these days. And...I'm flying to India next week. If you can wait, I can arrange something next month. Hey... How can you think so low? I want to take you two out for lunch. You'll take us out for lunch. So what's the problem? You two are my best friends. What do you want, PP? - Nothing! Fine, I want a small favor. Small one. See, Velji. I knew it. When PP's too generous.. ..it means his shop's in trouble. It's not like you think. It's not like you think. Come on, speak up... what do you want? What do you want? Okay, okay. Listen. Somehow we've to get Koko-dile out of the house. ..and one of you has to pose as my father. What? Relax. Relax. Calm down. You'll get a heart attack. Let me explain, I'll explain everything. Listen. What's going on, papa? Are you drunk in the morning? Come. Oh my. Last night, when I was walking alone. You, alone? Don't interfere, I'll cancel your marriage. Okay, sorry. Go on. Last night, when I was walking alone.. ..my heart said to me "PP, you're no longer a young". That happened 20 years ago, dad. Sorry. Sorry. Go on. Go on. Continue. I want to bring a change. I...want to spend more time with my family.. ..with Jigar and his future wife, and with you. Now...it's time for a change, Koki. My coarse husband...is sounding sweeter than Shah Rukh Khan today. These pointy hairs like Sanjay Dutt. The colorful Himesh Reshamiya shirt. And.. Red shoes? Fine, fine. I am very happy. It's all babaji's blessings. - Babaji? Koki... - Compulsory. Hold on. - Okay Koki. - Yeah. Get me some water. - Now? Please. - I'll get it. Who is it, dad? Why don't you... mind your own business. Hello. - Hi, PP. I hope I'm not disturbing you, right? What are you saying? You can never disturb me. If you don't call me, I'll get disturbed. Please...don't be so formal with me. Treat me like a buddy. PP, you're such a darling. I called because.. I'll come on Saturday, not Sunday. It won't be a problem, right? What are you saying? Of course you can come, this is your home. Why Saturday, you can come today. Give me an hour, I'll call you and confirm it. Okay, PP. - Bye. I'll call Velji. Moron, what's your problem? You're always sneaking up on me.. ..either from inside the cupboard, or from behind the door. Are you my son or black-money? Who were you calling home? The stray-animal catches. They must be on their way, better hide. Oh Lord.. Patel. It's 11 o'clock. Hello. Hello. What hello...I made the call. Mansukh bhai. How are you? All okay? Keep speaking. What? Shanti Bai is serious. You're serious about Shanaya. Your grandma.. - Grandma! She isn't dead yet. She isn't dead. She's just serious. - I see, give me the phone. Hold on, I am talking to him. Yes, go on. What? She's only got few days to live. Shanaya's going to be your guest. Jigar's marriage. What is she saying? Her last wish! You're wish.. - What is she saying? Get Jigar married with Naina. - What? Yes. Koki and I will fly down tomorrow morning. Only Koki. Why? Give me the phone. Okay...here talk to Koki. Talk to Koki. Here. Here. Hello. Hello. Why can't I hear anything? - Give it to me. It's a trunk call. And you know you're going deaf. - Yeah. Yes.. Hello. - Pervert, why did you give the phone to her? Listen...I'll send Koki for Mumbai tomorrow morning. She'll take a train after she lands, and see you in three days. Fine, I'm hanging up. Yeah. Granny. Poor granny. Poor thing's worried about Jigar's marriage.. ..even when she's on her deathbed. - Yes.. But you.. - Yeah. Malindo.. - He's doesn't care. Be quiet. Malindo, tomorrow morning first flight booking. Mumbai. Thank you. Jigar. Jigar! Mom has to leave for Mumbai tomorrow. Help her pack, I'll go get the ticket. Get the red bag. - Yeah! Get it from the top shelf. She isn't dead, she's just serious. She isn't dead. Yea, but I will have to pack, right? - Okay. Get it. - Okay. Gomyo, we go to airport... hurry.. Listen, Jigar. - Yes. Take care of the house. Take care of your papa. And remember... I'll get a gorgeous wife for you from Mumbai. But, you just stay calm. - Mom, just go. - Okay. Hail Lord, son. - Hail Lord. Hail, Lord. Gomyo, let's go. Hey, Jigar. Are you excited? - Of course I am excited. Europe trip. Pre-honeymoon. But...how did you convince dad? - I didn't. In fact, he said...go take a trip to Europe. Very unlike him. - I know, but who cares. Mom's left already. We're leaving too. And dad's all alone. Naina...I'll call you in a minute. 0kay. Dad. Dad. You'll be alone the entire week, right? - Yes, so. And where's Shanaya? Sitting on my lap. Don't you see her? Why are you asking about Shanaya? Don't you want to leave? Get lost. You know...PP can't be so lucky. - What do you mean? We filled the contest forms as well. - Right? And what did PP say? He'll submit our forms personally. Right. But he didn't submit our forms at all. - Oh, God! And he won. Yes, you're right. I'll have to do something now. - Velji. Don't do anything absurd. Praveen is our childhood friend. Nothing absurd... This time...I'll teach him a good lesson. I mean...PP will have to pay for his sin. What? Yes, my soon to-be father. You see, PP, I can't pose as your father. What? You see... I can't deceive sister-in-law. Are you crazy? I clearly told Shanaya that I live with my father.. ..that's the reason she's coming over. But.. -Bye, bye. Hello. What the.. Your plan's failing, PP. Think. Think. Think. Think. Yes. - Is it possible for you to keep quiet for a while? It would be very helpful. It looks so easy in films. One man...playing two roles. Why not in real.. Hi, dad. Thanks, best gift ever. Happy? - Yeah. Sometimes too much happiness isn't good. It can cause a heart attack. You aren't going anywhere. - What? I am going. - I said you're not going. But, dad.. Naina will slaughter me. You can't do this with me. Listen to me. Listen to me. - I won't. Hold on. Hold on. - No. Just listen. Hold on. Listen to me. Yes, that's more like it. - Hold on. If you try to get fresh with Shanaya.. ..and cheat on my mother.. Swear on your mother, that.. ..you won't break my mother's heart. - Yes. I won't do anything like that. I promise. Okay, dad. I'll be your father. But...I've got three conditions. - Tell me. No 1. You will promote my rock band. Done. No. 2. Get me married to Naina. Done. And no.3; if I am going to be your father, Naina will be your mom. Are you crazy? I'll slap you. Hi, Teddy. I was waiting for your call. I need to do an experiment. - Experiment. With me. How exciting. By experiment I mean... ..you've to make my son look like my father. What? I am in a fix. What do I tell her? Naina. Tea? Coffee? - What now? Breakfast...food...anything. What do you two want? You say it. - You do it. No, you. - No, you. Listen to me. Our trip to Europe. - Yeah. So excited. I know...but, we'll have to cancel that. - What? Liar! I knew you were going to do this. But, listen to me. - Naina, listen to him. He wants to say something. - Can I? Dad said he'll get us married. But there's a small condition. - Small. What? You'll have to pose as an old woman. What? It's a good idea. Listen to the plan. Look, Praveen, when I'm done with them.. ..they will look young and beautiful. No, no, no. No! I want...I want them to look old and ugly. What? Experiment. Secret. PP! Teddy. PP...Come, Honey. Come on in. - Yeah. Are you ready? - Yeah. My teddy. - Yes. Ta-dah! "Something's definitely fishy."

What are you two doing? You can't prance around like this. Here. Bend over...and walk slowly. Do it. Do it. Bend. Thank you so much, sir. - Hey! It's not for you. Get those in carefully. You're already late. - Yes. Come in. Muru! I'll call you when I need you. Now go in. Dad, it's only Muru. What difference does it make? Jigar...I can hear your voice, but where are you? You fool...wandering soul, I am right here. Hey... Don't think too hard. And you? Do you want to get me killed? She must be on her way. Go inside. Hey... Come on. Sir! Is this Praveen Patel's house. Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! What sir.. Hi. Shanaya's here. She's here. This is for you. She's here. Sorry! This is for you. - Thank you. PP. Praveen? Shall we go inside? - Yeah. Come in. Bring those inside. Bye. This is my home. Muru. Shanaya... You're looking very nice. Really? - Yes, truly. Praveen, you're so sweet. Son, it's time for my nap. And what are you up to? This...is Shanaya, our guest. And he's my father. Hello, uncle. - Hello. You're very beautiful. Praveen's papa... Your milk's kept in your room. You won't like it if it gets cold. And stop getting so hot at this age. Otherwise, you won't like what I do with you. Father...shall I give you a hand. - I'll go. Your mom's waiting for me. - Go, go. Bye. - Shanaya, that's my mom. Mom, this is Shanaya.

She stays in her bedroom. She doesn't come out. Why? Why? The doctor has advised her bed-rest. Bed-rest? But, PP, she was just.. - Yes. Sometimes she.. You see, just like commercial breaks on television, she also.. But let's forget it. Why are we discussing her? Okay, it'll be good for me too. Influence. Female influence, right? - Yes. PP, where's my room? You...can sleep in my room. - PP, don't be naughty. I will sleep alone. - I didn't mean that. I meant...you can sleep in my room. And I will sleep in the study. PP...you're so sweet. But...why are we talking about bed? I mean...are you in a hurry to get in bed? - No. So let's sit and talk. - On the bed? No, here. Let's sit here. - I see. Shall we? - Okay. Come on. Yeah. Hold on. You? - Bloody useless...what kind of a son are you? Your father's standing outside and ringing the bell.. And you're not concerned about him at all. No, no.. What are you posing as? - Your father. See, see, did you see what kind of a son is he. I mean...I'm growing old and he's losing his memory. Anyways, I am Praveen's father...baby.. - Hold on. Come here. I told you no, didn't I? I wanted to help you out. I know why you're here you bloody pervert. Get out. Listen, either you let your father stay here.. ..or I will call Jigar's mom. You bloody.. What's happening? PP talking to papa. - No, no. PP, your papa.. - Yes. He's my second father. - What? I mean...my adopted father. - What? I mean.. Come here. You see... He's a distant relative. Relative. And...he separated from his son in a fair. - How sad. Since then he considers me his son. - So sweet. So you adopt him too. - What? I am sorry. I mean...consider him as a father too. He's a nice man. He won't bite, harmless. Okay. I guess...the bigger the family, better for me. Yes. What's that you say in Gujarati? - That?

Whose is it? - Mine. So you take it. - It's for you. Make up your mind, yours or mine? Sir, I wrote this letter for you. Hey...just tell me what's wrong. Actually, this is my resignation letter. - What? I am quitting this job and joining the band, as a drummer. You.. Are you crazy? You want to be a drummer. You have such a nice job. You get paid at the end of every month. You have a good boss. If you quit, I won't take you back again. Its okay, sir. Actually, sir, even I have dreams. You just don't see it, but that's okay. You get on with your life, and I'll get on with mine. Do you know how absurd you sound? Are you in your senses? I wasn't all these years, but I am now. I am a bit late, but I still got time. So...please, sir. It's okay. There you go. Hello. Who? - This is Vivek Hinduja. Who do you want? - I want Shanaya. And you are? PP. Praveen Patel. Shanaya. - Hey. Some PP's calling for you. Give me the phone. Be a sweetheart, can you zip me please? Oh yes, sure. It's good. - That's so sweet. Will you give me a second? - Please take your time. Hi, PP. - Hi. Who's Vivek? Your secretary? No, he's my costar. He's such a fabulous actor, and he's so sweet. What do I do if he's sweet? Are you getting jealous? Me...why would I get jealous? Actors come and go. I was just saying.. ..why don't you come down to my office for lunch. There's no one here. Even my assistant ran away. No possible, PP. I have just half an hour. And...it kind of sounds a little boring. So...now I am boring? - No, PP. Why are you getting so serious? - No. It's okay if you don't want to come. But don't forget to eat. Don't stay hungry. Don't worry, I'll eat with Vivek. And do you remember Naina and Jigar from the concert? They are coming to meet the director. Looks positive. "I don't know what bond I share with you." Hey, PP... Nice to see you. Hey, guys, look who's here. Mr. Praveen Patel, the owner of the house. Hi, Praveen. I hope you don't mind, I kept a music session here. Mr. Patel, you're a wonderful host. - Host? But I haven't done anything. Praveen, just listen to this young group's song. Guys, hit it. We can have it? One, two, three, four.. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! You guys can continue, I...I'll be.. What's wrong? Patel, speak up. They're playing so loudly. You should've thought about mom and dad. It must be bothering them. They went to the Prem Puri Ashram, they won't be back in the evening. And Velji? He isn't here either. PP, you're looking stressed. What's wrong? Not stressed.. You could've told me you're going to do this. No, I didn't mean that.. I mean.. You have time for this, you've time for parties.. ..you have time for Vivek, to have lunch and dinner with him. But you don't have time for me. Did you even ask whether I am tensed or not? Am I okay, or not? Did you ever ask? Have you finished? Yes! Sit here for five minutes, I'll be right back. Shanaya.. Where are you going? Shanaya, listen to me.. Don't touch me. You insulted me. Shanaya. Shanaya. Why are you crying? - So? What do you care? Why are you saying that? How else do I say it, Praveen? Shanaya, I am sorry. I shouldn't have screamed at you. But...I don't like Vivek at all. And when you spend time with him, I.. - You feel insecure. He's my costar, it's professional. I have to do it. I know, but I still don't like it. Why? Who am I to you? Shanaya, you mean everything to me. Then marry me? Marriage? - Why? Speechless? You can't marry me, can you? Your world looks at our world.. ..with a completely different perspective. I know what you think of actresses. Wherever I go, everyone's eyes stay on me. I know where they're looking, what they're looking at.. ..and what they're thinking about doing with me. Today when I am with you, you're proud to show me off. Look, there's an actress with you. All I did was hug my costar, and it made you jealous. It's my job, PP. If we were together, will you let me work? And if you do let me work.. ..can you adjust yourself with an actress' lifestyle? And when people stare at me.. ..will you be able to control yourself? Will you understand my professional behavior? You can't. Because your insecurities will eat you up. Every man fantasizes about an actress. But when he has her.. ..he doesn't know what to do with her. It takes a strong, secure man to marry an actress. So PP, you live your life, and let me live mine. Let me go. Shanaya, please. Shanaya... Shanaya, please don't leave me like this. You can't do anything for me. Shanaya, I'm ready to do anything for you. Bet on it, I'll do anything for you. Fine, when the time comes.. ..I'll ask you for what I want. Good morning, Mr. Patel. Congratulations, sir. Praveen...hello. Congratulations. Yo man, what a champ you are. Mr. Patel, finally you scored. Sir, you're dream walked out of the DVD. You hit the jackpot. Praveen, look at you. Someone get the groom ready. Roberto. Hi, Teddy. Roberto, what is this.. I personally picked this dress for you. You know, PP...I will miss you. Velji, what's happening? Am I dreaming? - PP, your dream is finally coming true. Are you crazy.. Guys, what's going on? Daddy, you're getting married. - What? Yes, dad, everything is going according to plan. Come on, Shanaya is waiting for you. But... How did this escalate to marriage? Will someone explain me? But dad you said you're going to marry Shanaya. And then leave with her. When did I say that? It doesn't matter, dad. You will marry Shanaya, I will marry Naina. Mom will stay with us. You'll be happy in your world, and we'll be happy in ours. Hold on. What's.. Take him away. - Where? Come on.. - What are you doing? Come on, PP. Come on. Come, PP. You said, PP...you'll give me whatever I want. Yes. So I want you...to marry her right here, right now. Look, Shanaya, I want to say something. Shanaya, I made a big mistake. Look, I lied to you. I cannot marry you, and.. ..sorry I can't marry you either. Look...I am already married and I love my wife. Forgive me, Shanaya, I.. - Hey, Patel. Didn't I tell you...I'm Mehsana's Patlani. It's impossible to even get me out of your heart, smarty. She...she...she... How? I'll tell you. That night when I went to my room, I met Kokila. She told me the entire story. That she's your wife. And Jigar's your son. You deviated, for a date and a dream. , Since that moment.. ..everything I did to you.. ..it was just acting. And this way...you all made a plan to teach you a lesson. All of us? - All of us! Jigar...only Naina and you knew about it. So this was.. You did all this you stupid fool. Hey Patel, don't abuse him in front of his bride. You can do it later. I was joking. I was saying, now that we've already spent a lot.. ..why don't we get these two engaged. Yeah! Great. Thank you, dad. Love you. - Mom. Now the bride and groom exchange rings. Congratulations. Congratulations. Shanaya, forgive me. I had strayed. But...everyone opened my eyes. Thank you very much. And once again sorry for lying to you. You're so sweet. You know, PP. I learnt much more about life, than my role. Gathiya, Undhiya, Khakra.. And Garba. It's always going to be a part of my life. But now I have to go. Baby - Control. Group Hug. "How will I say it?
