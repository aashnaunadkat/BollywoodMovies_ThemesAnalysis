00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,567
<i>The Father of our Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
wasn't just the first 'Satyagrahi'...</i>

2
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,317
<i>...but, also the first
'cleanliness activist' too.</i>

3
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:51,692
<i>Even though it's been 100 years
since Chaparan Satyagraha...</i>

4
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:53,359
<i>...we still couldn't get rid
of the filth in our country.</i>

5
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,109
<i>But now, under the leadership of
Prime Minister Narendra Modi...</i>

6
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,817
<i>...Gandhiji's dream of clean
India will become a reality...</i>

7
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:58,609
<i>...on his 150 birth anniversary,
that is 2nd October, 2019.</i>

8
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,692
<i>This is our small
contribution to his campaign.</i>

9
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:02,147
<i>Our heartfelt
homage to Gandhiji.</i>

00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:30,271
<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b>.</font>

11
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,484
Once she starts insisting,
there's no way to turn her down.

12
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:33,525
You just can't say no to her.

13
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,275
So why don't you go
for a third one?

14
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:37,230
I am not Farah Khan.

15
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,567
She's already had triplets.

16
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:40,775
But here, keep continue...

17
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:43,189
And if you're so fascinated by the idea
then why don't you try for another one?

18
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:44,397
Forget it...

19
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,522
I've my hands full with
one 'Ninja Hattori'.

20
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,605
By the way, Chulni, how is
your mother-in-law's knee?

21
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:53,939
It's as good as new.

22
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,150
No wonder she's been racking
her brains a lot recently.

23
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,689
My mother-in-law has
lost her marbles.

24
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,556
She makes me slog over the
sewing machine all day.

25
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:01,174
I see...

26
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,192
Well, speaking of machines, I've heard
Neelam goes on and on like a machine.

27
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,150
What have you been feeding
your husband these days?

28
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,109
Tell us too.

29
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:08,734
She can't stop smiling.

30
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:11,025
- Tell us too.
- Spill it out.

31
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:14,025
Our husbands fall
flat on the bed...

32
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,109
...as if they were moving
mountains all day.

33
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:17,814
Tell us...

34
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:20,442
Where did you find
this magical herb?

35
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:21,814
Tell us.

36
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,439
Tell us.

37
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,525
Oh, my... where did
you get that done?

38
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,355
Well, last month he took me
to Delhi... for sight-seeing.

39
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:36,897
We must get one soon too.

40
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,522
Normally, men get us pregnant
and then forget all about us.

41
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,814
Listen to my
mother-in-law? But why?

42
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:48,647
She just needs a reason...

43
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,439
You'll get a stomach-ache...

44
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,230
Who is he?

45
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:01,230
<i>Oh, my...</i>

46
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:06,442
That rascal intentionally
flashed his light on us.

47
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:08,855
- You are right.
- Rascal.

48
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:17,647
No, you go, I can't come?

49
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,775
Sonu has made a mess at home.

50
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:23,564
Hey madam, won't
you let me pass?

51
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:28,272
If I flash my dipper
now, you'll get furious.

52
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:39,147
Keep flashing your
dipper now. Rascal.

53
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:43,734
- Jaya...
- You taught him a good lesson.

54
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:45,147
- Bye.
- Bye.

55
00:07:56,897 --> 00:08:01,275
"There are many
beautiful girls.."

56
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,314
"But all eyes staring at you.."

57
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,314
Oh my, God! Oh my, God!

58
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:09,650
"But what do I say about me..
Even the moon praises me.."

59
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,272
Is someone going to lower the
volume of the television?

60
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,442
It's pointless...

61
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:20,817
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

62
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:27,439
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."
"Oh my baby doll of gold.."

63
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:31,605
Kakka... you won't
see more that way.

64
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:34,772
Actually, son, I can see more.

65
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,397
My number has increased.

66
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:37,484
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

67
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,442
- Kakka, let me take a look.
- No.

68
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,984
- Just once... only once...
- I said...

69
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,980
I hope you can see
all big and clear.

70
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:48,355
Vidya, you just broke
our concentration.

71
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,355
Scenes like these... makes
it a 'good morning'.

72
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,192
Jagdish, my son... why did
you change the channel?

73
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:55,317
- Why did you change the channel?
- Yes, why did you?

74
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:56,609
If he can watch it in front
of his daughter-in-law...

75
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,609
..then you can also watch it in
front of your young daughter.

76
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:02,355
She watches it on her
mobile, he on the computer.

77
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:03,814
<i>And 1 watch it on the TV...</i>

78
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,605
...Instead we should
all watch it together.

79
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,942
Why not? Let's forget all shame.

80
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:09,942
- Listen Sunny...
- Huh?

81
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:11,939
- I mean... what's her name?
- Vidya?

82
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:15,105
Listen Vidya, I may
have a dirty mind.

83
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,522
But I have a clean heart.

84
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:18,355
And... one of the
most religious..

85
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,067
..and cultured country in the world
has one of the largest population.

86
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:23,025
Kakka i had.. no
contribution in it.

87
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,314
I only have one daughter.

88
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,442
And for a fact, she's
so pampered...

89
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,439
...that she's still studying
when she should've settled down.

90
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:30,650
Haven't you seen kakka's
Japanese degrees?

91
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,439
Yeah.

92
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,775
It's only natural for some of his talents
to rub off on his granddaughter.

93
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:36,772
I wonder what good are these
Japanese degrees in agriculture.

94
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:38,980
No one even knows
what's written on them.

95
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:41,314
- And you know.
- You're spoiling our daughter.

96
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,022
- Me?
- Stop all this right now!

97
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:44,355
Don't you have any shame?

98
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:49,522
"Fair boys... fair boys..."

99
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:50,772
Sunny. again?

100
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:52,397
Not you..

101
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,772
"I sway my hips and dance. I
wear my earrings and dance."

102
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:58,105
Is it her birthday today?

103
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:05,647
You're going to look stunning
in your wedding dress.

104
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,397
Even you'll look quite
appealing in your suit.

105
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:16,314
Keshav, why do you keep playing
with my thumb all the time?

106
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:19,064
Can't help it, baby. That's as
far as I am destined to get.

107
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,984
Never imagined we'll be getting
married on the same day...

108
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:22,730
...but to different people.

109
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:26,980
Naru's calling. Here.

110
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,439
- Yeah, go on.
- Radhe-Radhe, brother.

111
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,442
Only five more minutes before
the Auspicious time to start.

112
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,814
Are you planning
on starting a war?

113
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,647
The bride's family is waiting.

114
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:39,650
Be quiet... you make it sound like
I am marrying Mallika Sherawat.

115
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,105
Doesn't matter... at least
she has the same name.

116
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:43,647
You see... the wedding cards
have been distributed...

117
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,484
...guests have arrived and the
procession is ready to leave.

118
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:47,064
So... where are you?

119
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,234
- Naru.
- Yes.

120
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,355
Is that Keshav?

121
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:53,609
Tell him, if we miss
this auspicious day...

122
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:55,525
...the next auspicious date
comes only after 36 years.

123
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:56,605
Tell him.

124
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,855
I'm sure you heard everything.

125
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:00,567
Tell him... I'm going
through a break-up.

126
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:01,730
This will take time.

127
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,980
So... what are your plans
for your wedding night?

128
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:07,355
What about you?

129
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,605
Don't forget to take the
glass of milk on time.

130
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:10,772
Forget it...

131
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,397
Your beloved wife will bring
an entire milk dairy with her.

132
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,689
Well, then I'll send you all
the cottage-cheese you want.

133
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,897
My God, cottage cheese
makes you blush.

134
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,939
I wonder what you'll
do if I say cream?

135
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:30,730
Well, that's the end
of this love-story.

136
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:33,647
Now go marry your groom.

137
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:37,442
I wish you had mustered some
courage to talk to your father...

138
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,189
...then you would be
getting married to me.

139
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:40,522
And not with that Mallika.

140
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,942
Doesn't matter... we both
had our share of fun.

141
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:45,942
We had some really good
time together, right.

142
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:49,105
Listen... we'll keep meeting even
after the wedding, won't we?

143
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:50,817
After the wedding... never!

144
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:51,775
I have a strict policy...

145
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:54,647
Never fiddle around with
someone's television or wife...

146
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,942
You'll get the shock
of your life.

147
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:58,439
Oh my boy of principles.

148
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,064
Are you going to post your
wedding photos on Facebook?

149
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:02,522
I will, sis...

150
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,230
Get lost. Go marry
that milk-maid.

151
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:18,647
Radhe-Radhe, brother. Brother,
father is very furious.

152
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,939
Then ask father to sit
at the dais in my place.

153
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:23,859
Guess you're in a
bad mood today.

154
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,230
But this is amazing...

155
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:26,692
You give those girls
driving lessons, but...

156
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:28,355
...they switch partners when
they need a permanent driver.

157
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,692
You know what, the day I
find my kind of girl...

158
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,564
...I swear I will rattle
Panditji's world.

159
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,109
You can say anything
you like out here.

160
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,439
Because you can't say a
word in front of father.

161
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:40,814
Come, brother. Time to suit up.

162
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,397
Sister-in-law Mallika
beckons you.

163
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,480
"Mallika is all grown up..."

164
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:49,439
"...like a dairy of milk."

165
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:54,855
[CHANTING PRAYER]

166
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:12,689
Come, Sister-in-law.

167
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:19,939
He's Manglik.

168
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,939
Plus, the planets and stars in
his birth-chart are unfavorable.

169
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:24,272
Only this Buffalo can
save his life now.

170
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,355
Congratulations.

171
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,647
Finally, there's some hope
for Keshav to get married.

172
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,692
Only when we find someone with
two thumbs on her left hand...

173
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:32,942
...can he get married?

174
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,522
- I see?
- Yes...

175
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:44,564
Bless you. Bless you two.

176
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:48,525
Great...

177
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:49,980
That's called moving up in life.

178
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:51,817
From Mallika the Buffalo to
Mallika the sister-in-law.

179
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,397
Congratulations, brother Keshav.

180
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:14,980
Naru!

181
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,609
- Naru.
- Yes.

182
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,397
- Where are you, you numbskull?
- Coming, father.

183
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:22,900
Have you got ants
in your pant...

184
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,814
...that you're running
around like this. Huh!

185
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:26,942
The shipment hasn't arrived yet.

186
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:30,359
Well, father, we've already
placed an order for cycle chains.

187
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:33,564
Brother and I will catch a train and
go buy those tubes for the cycles.

188
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,564
The accounts are in a mess.

189
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:38,400
It's hard to believe
there's a discrepancy...

190
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,314
...on brother Keshav's
watch, father.

191
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:42,730
Really? Where is your brother?

192
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:44,522
Enjoying his honeymoon?

193
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:53,564
- Tell him.
- Yes, father.

194
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:55,109
This week I will
sit in the shop...

195
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:57,150
...Chandu will take an off, and
you two will do the cooking.

196
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,105
Okay father...

197
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
But father...

198
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,064
- Radhe-Radhe, brother.
- Rad he-Rad he.

199
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:12,105
Cooking bread, are you?

200
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:17,647
You know what, I can't see
you in this predicament.

201
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,439
Should I call
sister-in-law instead?

202
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:20,772
She will cook bread for you.

203
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:27,439
You're pulling my
leg, aren't you?

204
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:29,692
You see... your
sister-in-law has solved...

205
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:31,939
- ...half the problems in my birth-chart.
- Yes.

206
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,230
I've 50% chances of
getting married now.

207
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,855
Now just wait and watch when I bring
a beautiful and smart wife, like me.

208
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,942
I'll even cook bread for her.

209
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,522
And you'll be fuming
with jealousy.

210
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,730
Let's not get so far
ahead of ourselves.

211
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:45,859
Did you forget about
father's second condition?

212
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,730
Where will you find
someone with two thumbs?

213
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,314
Will she descend from the sky?

214
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:53,522
Take my advice, brother.

215
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,814
Forsake all hopes
of getting married.

216
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,522
And you should mourn instead.

217
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,984
Even the children of your friends
are now going to school.

218
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,525
And that Kabir Bedi got
married for the fourth time.

219
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,605
And you couldn't even find one.

220
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:05,775
It's not your cup of tea.

221
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:07,397
You're going to
die a bachelor...

222
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:08,730
That's the limit.

223
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:10,439
Can't we brothers
talk in private?

224
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:12,730
Why does sister-in-law keep
getting offended all the time?

225
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,025
- Uncle, move aside.
- Yes, dear.

226
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:19,189
Everyone's standing in the way.

227
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:20,650
I'll just make a quick
visit to the toilet.

228
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,939
I'm coming too.

229
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:24,525
- Yuck...
- What happened?

230
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,939
At least let me pee
in peace, madam.

231
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:29,567
Disgusting people... why
can't they lock the door?

232
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,734
Men think why should
we lock the door?

233
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:33,734
Real maturity is about
peeing with the doors open.

234
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:35,734
- No shame at all.
- Right...

235
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:37,564
They knew the door was open...

236
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,314
...but thought it was against
their pride to knock.

237
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:40,900
Wouldn't you call
that impolite, Naru?

238
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,359
This isn't your house's main
door that we need to knock?

239
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,605
Of course not, it's a garden...

240
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,605
...where you can take
a stroll freely.

241
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,942
Hey brother, talk to me.

242
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,022
Get it?

243
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,980
What are you staring at?
I am talking to you.

244
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,439
Hey, brother...

245
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:11,564
Call me rude, but don't
call me brother.

246
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,817
Look at your age.

247
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,855
Are you going to teach
this to your children too?

248
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,272
How can I have kids?

249
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:17,980
I am still a bachelor-.

250
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:21,272
I see... no wonder.

251
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,855
No wonder he looks so desperate.

252
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:24,772
Move.

253
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:26,105
I said move.

254
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:28,647
You didn't even wash
your hands. Yuck.

255
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:36,980
She just publicly
humiliated you.

256
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,189
Doesn't matter, Naru.

257
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:43,064
It's my fault, so I
must pay the price.

258
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:46,147
What a big heart?

259
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,564
I washed my hands.

260
00:17:58,355 --> 00:17:59,605
Are you crazy?

261
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,314
He just splashed
water in my eye.

262
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:02,647
Crazy man.

263
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,105
Hey...

264
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:12,647
"May no one throw
stones, at my lover.."

265
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:14,730
Come, the station has
arrived. Let's go.

266
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,147
Great... you're here.

267
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,692
- Here you go, Uncle.
- Get down.

268
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:33,567
- Your cycle has arrived.
- Okay.

269
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,855
On-time delivery.

270
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:37,314
Bravo...

271
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:40,147
Did the blunder. What is this?

272
00:18:40,397 --> 00:18:41,939
What happened, uncle?

273
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,442
I asked for Sunny Leone...

274
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,064
...but you got me
Sunny Deol instead.

275
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:47,314
Did he ask for a lady's cycle?

276
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,442
I don't remember. Maybe...

277
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:50,942
What do you mean you
can't remember?

278
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:53,272
- Check the order again.
- We're checking, again.

279
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:54,147
Please do.

280
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,397
No need to worry, uncle.

281
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,855
You must have a saw at home.

282
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:00,064
- Just cut off that middle rod.
- That's right.

283
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:02,442
- And it will be a lady's cycle.
- Right.

284
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:05,439
And uncle, you can use that rod
to drive away the monkeys.

285
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:06,442
Get on...

286
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:07,980
- That's no way to do business.
- This is how we do it.

287
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,400
Listen... Radhe Cycle,
this isn't right.

288
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,439
- Get lost.
- I will not spare you.

289
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,314
Brother, it's that way.
What are you doing?

290
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:21,275
What's going on?

291
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:22,939
Attending to the customer.

292
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:24,647
Come on... get the saw.

293
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,064
We'll cut off that rod.

294
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:27,605
What made you change your mind?

295
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,689
- You were leaving.
- What's going on here?

296
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:31,859
Did you buy a new cycle for me?

297
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,522
I thought I'll give
you a surprise.

298
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:34,855
But these guys from
Radhe Cycle...

299
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:36,064
- Listen.
- Yes.

300
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:38,442
I've found that thief who's
been stealing our clothes.

301
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:39,234
Coming.

302
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:40,480
It's amazing.

303
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:42,859
Well, it was supposed
to be a lady's cycle...

304
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:43,942
...but we mixed up the order...

305
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:45,522
Why are you going off-track now?

306
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:48,730
You?

307
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,400
The rude guy from the bathroom.

308
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,772
No, I'm the cycle guy.

309
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:53,609
Your father ordered
a lady's cycle...

310
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,647
...but we got a gents
cycle instead.

311
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:56,484
Doesn't matter.

312
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:59,234
This one's a gents cycle,
isn't it? I'll keep it.

313
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:00,234
How can you keep it?

314
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:02,609
- It's our fault, we'll fix it.
- What do you mean?

315
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:04,939
I like this design,
I'll keep this one.

316
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,025
This isn't a joke. How are
you going to ride this?

317
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,400
There's a rod in the middle.

318
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,980
- Hey, Radhe Cycle...
- Keshav.

319
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,522
Whatever your name is?

320
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:14,230
Try to keep an open mind,
not the bathroom's door.

321
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,730
For your kind information...

322
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:19,314
...what did women wear when
cycles were invented in 1860?

323
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:20,522
Dresses.

324
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:23,234
And the rod in the middle was
removed for their safety.

325
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:24,605
And what do we wear now?

326
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:26,397
- What?
- Jeans.

327
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:27,772
So the rod doesn't matter.

328
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:29,984
Her general knowledge
is better than yours.

329
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:33,647
Doesn't matter... she's a female.
You spoke really well, madam.

330
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:37,647
But after 1860, in 1885
came safety cycles...

331
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:39,564
...which had a chain
and peddle as well.

332
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:42,400
Ladies got their freedom
of movement after that.

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,980
Great...

334
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:46,647
- Yes, but...
- I'm on your side, madam.

335
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:48,855
I don't differentiate
between ladies and gents.

336
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,442
That's why I prefer trains.

337
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:53,025
There are no separate toilets
for ladies and gents.

338
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:56,234
- But you must lock them.
- Of course.

339
00:20:56,314 --> 00:20:57,980
Whether it's a ladies or gents.

340
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:01,900
Well, that's enough
lesson for one day.

341
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,772
No... please go on,
I am loving it.

342
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:06,939
Jaya, what happened?

343
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:09,150
What's wrong? You're still here.

344
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,855
Well, uncle, I was
just leaving...

345
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,689
Jaya got me talking.

346
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,234
- Shall we go now?
- Yes.

347
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:15,859
Okay, uncle...

348
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:16,564
Hold it.

349
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,442
If you ever have a problem,
just give me a call.

350
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:19,147
Yes.

351
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:21,900
My personal mobile number is
written behind this cycle.

352
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,730
- Give it to your entire family.
- Yes.

353
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,980
- I forgot to shift gears.
- Yes.

354
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:28,480
See you... Okay.

355
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,522
Papa“.

356
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:35,692
Brother... it's falling...

357
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:38,272
What are you doing? Can't you
see through those glasses?

358
00:21:52,314 --> 00:21:54,605
What happened?

359
00:21:57,397 --> 00:21:58,814
What happened?

360
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:03,064
Is that her or am I
imagining things?

361
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,772
That's her alright?

362
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:06,397
She's a topper.

363
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:09,189
Don't even think about her.

364
00:22:11,105 --> 00:22:13,939
Do you have the number of
Kanhaiyya, the computer guy?

365
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:16,564
Yes will get it.

366
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,772
"Since the day we met..."

367
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:34,772
can't stop smiling."

368
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:45,564
"I keep telling
everyone... I see."

369
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:56,897
"Stay away from this fantasy
or life will be doomed."

370
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:58,734
"Quit smiling, silly.."
- Brother, give me tea.

371
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:02,484
"..or I'll fall in love."
- Madam, tea.

372
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:07,272
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

373
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,939
Bloody thief.

374
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,939
Hello. How are you, Vasudev?

375
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,067
Where are you?

376
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,564
Madam, what's the time?

377
00:23:24,022 --> 00:23:25,147
- 9:00.
- Thank you.

378
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,105
Yes.

379
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:31,359
"I used to feel... love's
too far-fetched for me..."

380
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,525
"...because I had no dreams."

381
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:38,647
"But since we met, I feel
a little unrestrained."

382
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:43,984
"I feel like I'm
lost in your eyes."

383
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:48,897
"Like sandalwood gets
dissolved in water."

384
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,480
She has only five fingers.

385
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:54,272
"The heart's willing
to do anything."

386
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,439
Move.

387
00:23:55,939 --> 00:24:01,147
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

388
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,064
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

389
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:11,689
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

390
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:14,064
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

391
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,730
- Jaya.
- Yes.

392
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:17,480
Isn't that you?

393
00:24:20,397 --> 00:24:21,605
Why that...

394
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:26,064
Where is he?

395
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:27,605
Where's that bloody Radhe cycle?

396
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:28,605
<i>Why...</i>

397
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:30,980
Who do you think you are?

398
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:32,855
Kuldeep, get a cup
of tea for ma'am.

399
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:33,939
Yes, ma'am?

400
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:35,355
With whose permission
did you put that up?

401
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,939
With whose permission did
you take my picture?

402
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:38,397
You think you're smart?

403
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,067
I'll shut down Radhe
Cycles for good.

404
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:44,275
Cancel the tea, get a cold drink.
Calm down, madam, calm down.

405
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:47,189
You're a topper. I really
care about education.

406
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:48,939
It's just a marketing strategy.

407
00:24:49,105 --> 00:24:53,480
I swear since we put your face on the
hoarding, sales have gone up 8%.

408
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:56,147
And it's also sending a
message to the girls.

409
00:24:56,814 --> 00:24:59,567
Whatever... I didn't top my
class to increase your sales.

410
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:02,067
- I know...
- Then know this.

411
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:04,939
If you don't take all the
posters down by tomorrow...

412
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:06,439
...you will be in big trouble.

413
00:25:06,897 --> 00:25:08,189
Moron!

414
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:15,355
Madam, you... forgot your phone.

415
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:18,355
As well as my mobile
number in it.

416
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,314
Yes, Anu.

417
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,064
Brother, I did exactly
like you said.

418
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:28,189
But that Jeetu is
terrified of his father.

419
00:25:28,272 --> 00:25:30,189
He says he won't elope with me.

420
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,939
Did he lose a leg?

421
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,730
Why won't he elope with you?

422
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:35,355
Of course, he will.

423
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,022
Get two tickets for
Gorakhpur Express. Yeah...

424
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,605
Pack your bags and get
to the station tonight.

425
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,942
I'll handle the rest.

426
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,480
- But will Jeetu show up?
- Give me my phone.

427
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:46,689
Give me my phone.

428
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:49,150
You're such a disgusting man.

429
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,567
You're advising
someone to run away.

430
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:52,355
- Who are you talking to, brother?
- Hold on.

431
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:54,772
She's my cousin.

432
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:58,355
Whether I give her my advice, or
anything else why does it matter to you?

433
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:01,484
- Anu.
- Mad.

434
00:26:01,564 --> 00:26:04,355
- Yes, brother.
- From Gorakhpur head straight to Nepal.

435
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,230
Nepal?

436
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,564
Nepal is an amazing place.
Economical, reliable and realistic.

437
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:10,439
- I'll send you money from my mobile.
- But, brother...

438
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:13,314
Listen, sis, India is a
lot more advanced now.

439
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,897
Radhe-Radhe... take care.

440
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:17,147
Very good.

441
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:20,772
The brother inside you suddenly wakes
up and sacrifices your own sister.

442
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:22,814
How is it right to run
from your problems?

443
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:24,647
This is the best
advice right now.

444
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,775
This thinking...

445
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:29,397
This thinking... has
doomed this country.

446
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:31,275
If you have the guts
to love someone...

447
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:33,897
...you should be man enough
to admit it to your family.

448
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:38,189
Look, madam, their family
only has hatred and anger.

449
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
Because it doesn't take
time to hate someone...

450
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,522
...but, takes time
to understand love.

451
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:48,647
Soon the hatred will resolve until
then, let them enjoy their honeymoon.

452
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:52,314
Our thinking is so different.

453
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:53,859
No, it's not.

454
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:57,234
You're saying 'talk to the
family', I am saying 'run away'..

455
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,522
..but we're both on
the side of love.

456
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:00,772
Crazy...

457
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:02,442
You're crazy.

458
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:04,605
Madam, listen...

459
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:07,022
It's quite late,
I'll drop you home.

460
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:08,772
No need for that.

461
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:11,314
I swear I won't elope with you.

462
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:13,022
I can go myself.

463
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:15,439
Oh God, she's so
fluent in English.

464
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:24,730
Look straight... Stop ogling.

465
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:02,355
"Just like one needs
to breathe..."

466
00:28:02,564 --> 00:28:06,064
"Just like one needs
to breathe..."

467
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,564
"...to stay alive."

468
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:12,647
"All I need is a sweetheart..."

469
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:15,355
"...for falling in love."

470
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:20,734
"All I need is a sweetheart..."

471
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:23,105
"...for a massage."

472
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:26,189
Hey, brother, you're in
a colorful mood today.

473
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,522
Guess Holi isn't too far.

474
00:28:28,814 --> 00:28:30,984
By the way, brother, it's
your first Holi post wedding.

475
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:32,984
What color will you
put on sister-in-law?

476
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,397
Every color's going to suit her.

477
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:38,022
Radhe-Radhe... You're
in love, brother.

478
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:40,480
Don't get emotional and
pull her on your bike.

479
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:43,314
Just watch, she will definitely
sit on my Honda some day.

480
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:47,147
My advice is... load her on a truck and
take her to see Agra's, Taj Mahal.

481
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,772
I can build a Taj Mahal for her.

482
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,522
Oh brother, now
that's happy Holi.

483
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,609
Sister-in-law's grown young.

484
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:57,730
She's become a dairy...

485
00:28:58,397 --> 00:28:59,522
Are you crazy?

486
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,230
Are you crazy?

487
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:05,564
You just ruined my mood.

488
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,605
Get lost.

489
00:29:07,064 --> 00:29:09,480
I only said milk...

490
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:11,980
No, enough.

491
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,234
Wow, dear...

492
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:21,064
That's a really cheap ringtone?

493
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:22,689
Who is calling?

494
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:24,564
Don't ask, mom.

495
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,022
- My phone fell in the drain.
- I see...

496
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:29,439
I want to change your
mother's ringtone as well.

497
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:34,022
Are you listening? He wants
to throw you down the drain.

498
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:35,939
Pass me the salad.

499
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:41,022
Hey, brother, you're brushing
your teeth a lot today.

500
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:43,897
Just refreshing my breath.

501
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,522
I'm washing my underwear and
you're refreshing your breath.

502
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,189
That's what you're good for.

503
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:06,022
Brother... goggles, deodorant...

504
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:09,192
- What are you preparing for?
- It's a lover's parade...

505
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:11,355
Should be grand.

506
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,022
[FOLK SONG]

507
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:42,439
[FOLK SONG]

508
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:53,939
[FOLK SONG]

509
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
It should be stopped now.

510
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,730
Who beats their
husband like this?

511
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,230
They are simply venting their
anger on these poor souls.

512
00:31:07,397 --> 00:31:08,855
Look at their condition.

513
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Fine, then you don't
beat your husband.

514
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:14,439
I will never...

515
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:15,647
Look, there..

516
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:22,064
Hold on.. wait.. wait..

517
00:31:22,522 --> 00:31:25,314
Brother, thank God we
didn't get married.

518
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:27,355
Look at the size
of their sticks.

519
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,025
The men in our country hate
the idea of apologizing.

520
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,275
They certainly deserve this.

521
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:36,359
Hold on, aunty...

522
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,314
Coming through...
coming through...

523
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:46,272
- Oh my, God.
- He's flat on the ground.

524
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,814
- Hey.. Radhe.
- Don't beat him.

525
00:31:52,939 --> 00:31:54,689
Look there... there...

526
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:57,022
So brother... no. 19.

527
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,022
No...

528
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,647
No. 1.

[FOLK SONG]

531
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:10,439
Listen...

532
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:14,064
I need to talk to her
today at any cost.

533
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,314
Okay.

534
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:20,647
[FOLK SONG]

535
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,564
It's Holi!

536
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,234
She will be here...
She will be here...

537
00:32:35,314 --> 00:32:39,189
She will be here soon... She
will be here... be patient.

538
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,025
She's here... she's here.

539
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:44,189
Happy holi..

540
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,442
She is looking this way.

541
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:46,734
Even her friend's good looking.

542
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:48,980
When she comes here,
you guys leave.

543
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:50,897
She is still standing there.

544
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,025
She's here... she's here.

545
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:55,480
Tell her everything today.

546
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,355
Are you done yet?

547
00:32:58,105 --> 00:32:59,397
Chasing me around.

548
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:02,105
Your friends even teased
you taking my name.

549
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,272
You've been staring
at me all this time.

550
00:33:04,522 --> 00:33:06,605
You must be getting a kick
out of it, don't you?

551
00:33:06,772 --> 00:33:08,439
Are you clone ogling at me?

552
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:09,897
Satisfied now?

553
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:12,772
You boys think it's
right to ogle at girls?

554
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:16,105
Huh? Look at me, I
am talking to you!

555
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:19,397
All this doesn't suit
you. Look at your age.

556
00:33:19,522 --> 00:33:20,980
Don't you get it?

557
00:33:21,272 --> 00:33:23,272
There can never be
anything between us.

558
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:25,939
- Madam.
- What?

559
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:32,105
It's already
happened between us.

560
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:37,272
But you can't see it, or
maybe you're ignoring it.

561
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,980
You're the one
ignoring reality...

562
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:40,442
There's a big
difference between us.

563
00:33:40,522 --> 00:33:41,397
Do you get it?

564
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:47,439
I am just a college pass-out but my
GK's better than anyone out here.

565
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,814
I am a Pandit's (PRIEST) son,
but I eat eggs after praying.

566
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:57,064
I maybe over-age but, no kid in
this village can beat me in a race.

567
00:33:57,355 --> 00:33:59,900
From my sunglasses to my
t-shirt, everything is a fake...

568
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,730
...but I'm still pretty
rustic at heart!

569
00:34:03,147 --> 00:34:04,900
Now you decide whether you
want to tie the knot with..

570
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,939
...some ordinary IAS,
doctor or engineer...

571
00:34:07,022 --> 00:34:09,147
...or are you looking for
some romance in life.

572
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,897
And yes...

573
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,355
Let me tell you one
thing honestly.

574
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,314
Since the day I saw you...

575
00:34:19,355 --> 00:34:22,314
...I decided that I'll stand up
against the whole world for you!

576
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,147
And about following
you around...

577
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:29,439
Here you go...

578
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,064
I've deleted my number.

579
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:34,522
From your phone
and mine as well.

580
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,397
Goodbye. Let's go.

581
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:42,692
Bro, you were great today.

582
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:45,064
Bro, you were amazing today.

583
00:34:56,355 --> 00:35:06,522
"Feels like these days, I've been
capriciously riding the waves."

584
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:17,480
"And never leave without watching
my reflection in your eyes."

585
00:35:18,189 --> 00:35:28,480
"How do I stay away from your thoughts
you're the only one I think about."

586
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:33,980
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

587
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:39,022
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

588
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:44,480
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

589
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:50,397
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

590
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:53,230
Take these tires,
when the customers...

591
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,105
Hey, Radhe Cycle.

592
00:36:13,022 --> 00:36:16,022
Your nameplate's fallen
off. Put it back.

593
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:19,397
If something's wrong with my
cycle where am I going to call?

594
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:22,647
If you can take it off, then
you can put it back too.

595
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:25,105
You didn't have to come all
the way here for that.

596
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:26,147
Leave.

597
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,189
I may have studied BCA but, my
GK isn't better than yours.

598
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:35,442
I'm a Joshi's girl, but
I ride gents cycle.

599
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:37,525
From head to toe, I am
completely rustic..

600
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:39,647
..but my thinking's
completely modern.

601
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:40,897
Now you decide...

602
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:44,480
...whether you want to tie the knot
with some ordinary, homely girl or...

603
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:46,814
...do you want some
romance in life?

604
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,317
Sudhir... put the radium
nameplate on madam's cycle...

605
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:57,022
...so that my number
glitters even in the dark.

606
00:36:57,189 --> 00:37:00,147
And see to it that she
has no more trouble.

607
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,272
And take this one down.

608
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,397
I'll do a photoshoot for you.

609
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:17,692
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

610
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:23,022
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

611
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:28,480
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

612
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:33,897
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.

613
00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:37,730
- Listen.
- Huh.

614
00:37:38,772 --> 00:37:41,730
Will you come to topper,
with the marriage proposal?

615
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:42,814
No.

616
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:46,480
In fact, my advice is that you
shouldn't either. Just WhatsApp her.

617
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:49,980
- Aren't you my brother?
- No.

618
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,109
But if you still
insist on going...

619
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:55,022
...then be honest with them and
tell them about the 'two thumbs'.

620
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:58,605
They are educated people, you fool. Let
me make an impression on them first.

621
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,314
Otherwise, they will
show me the way out.

622
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,817
Will you come along?

623
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:08,105
Take me to Syria instead.
I am not coming with you.

624
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,942
How could I say no to
brother, isn't it, aunty?

625
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:14,525
So I had to come down to talk.

626
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:16,234
And uncle, I knew
this since the day...

627
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,855
...brother put up huge
hoardings of sister-in-law.

628
00:38:21,314 --> 00:38:23,605
- Can I ask you a question, son?
- Yes.

629
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:26,480
- I hope you won't mind.
- Not at all.

630
00:38:26,814 --> 00:38:29,064
Guys your age normally
have two kids.

631
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:31,480
- So why...
- There's Mallika.

632
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:34,105
I mean he will treat
sister-in-law like a queen.

633
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,897
- I see...
- You see... he's also past that age.

634
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,442
But he has many desires.

635
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:40,522
You see, aunty, I
never got the time.

636
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:43,397
In fact, I never came
across anyone like Jaya.

637
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:45,355
That's true.

638
00:38:45,814 --> 00:38:47,814
- Have some tea, son.
- No...

639
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,900
- I'll get you some cola.
- Get some cola for him, aunty.

640
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,442
But make sure it's sugar-free.

641
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:53,814
You see, brother likes
to maintain himself.

642
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:54,814
- I see...
- Right?

643
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,067
- No-no-no...
- I'll go get it for you.

644
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:57,359
- No need for that.
- Let's get to the point.

645
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,064
Yes.

646
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:00,984
Do you put the holy thread
over your ear while peeing?

647
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:04,522
No... not at all, uncle. No
formality in an emergency.

648
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:06,064
No... not at all.

649
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:07,192
Mahatma Gandhi has said...

650
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:09,689
"Be the change you wish
to see in the world."

651
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,772
Because the world...

652
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:14,064
International knowledge.

653
00:39:14,147 --> 00:39:15,147
Uncle...

654
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,480
I just love wise men.

655
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,939
- Sunny Leone or Mallika Sherawat?
- Huh?

656
00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:22,567
Tell him to stop..

657
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:23,189
What?

658
00:39:23,272 --> 00:39:25,814
- Sunny Leone or Mallika Sherawat?
- He's at it again.

659
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,564
Sunny Leone.

660
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,480
Give me five.

661
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:33,067
- Radhe Cycle.
- Yes.

662
00:39:33,147 --> 00:39:34,355
Take a seat.

663
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,984
Well... I completely
trust my daughter Jaya.

664
00:39:39,064 --> 00:39:40,064
I do too.

665
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:43,192
If she's chosen you, then there
must be something about you.

666
00:39:43,272 --> 00:39:45,147
- Yes.
- All I have to say is...

667
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:47,355
..just keep her happy.

668
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:51,230
Uncle, I can shut shop and
take up a government job.

669
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:54,647
- No-no...
- Just say it...

670
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:56,814
By the way, son, who else
is there in your family?

671
00:39:56,897 --> 00:40:00,230
There's me, Naru and
Panditji, my father.

672
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:02,814
All men.

673
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:07,772
Yes... mother passed
away when I was a kid.

674
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,400
- And our grandma lives in Gorakhpur.
- Okay, okay.

675
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,147
And anyway, aunty,
once he gets married..

676
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,022
..they will carry
forward the lineage.

677
00:40:17,522 --> 00:40:18,564
Children.

678
00:40:18,647 --> 00:40:19,939
So let's take this
one step ahead.

679
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:21,689
When is Keshav introducing
us to Panditji?

680
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:23,855
Don't ask him, sister-in-law.

681
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,564
Father will give
him special time.

682
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:29,147
Isn't that right, brother?
Let's go see father.

683
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:38,980
He seems to be in a good mood.

684
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:40,939
I'll go first.

685
00:40:44,147 --> 00:40:45,480
Guess who, father?

686
00:40:46,605 --> 00:40:47,942
Now what trouble is this?

687
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:52,064
Rascals, never let me
do anything in peace.

688
00:40:53,647 --> 00:40:57,189
Don't just stand there and
stare, say something.

689
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,897
Father, I was saying...

690
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:01,230
Father...

691
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:04,147
You want to go to Mumbai to
become a hero at this age.

692
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:10,105
Is business running in a loss?

693
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:14,355
Then what else is it?

694
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:16,942
Speak up.

695
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:18,275
Father, I... he...

696
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:20,605
- Brother...
- I want to get married.

697
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,564
Get me married.

698
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:27,105
Curses.

699
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:30,022
- I can see that.
- What, father?

700
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:32,064
The volcano erupting inside you.

701
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:33,864
What?

702
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:35,439
You've got some of
father's pee on your cheek.

703
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:40,817
You numbskulls... I've
told you a thousand times.

704
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:44,897
Your wife must have two
thumbs on her hand.

705
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:47,439
We already have a buffalo tied
in our courtyard with two horns.

706
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:49,189
Let's stop ranting
about two-thumbs.

707
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:53,230
You fool... that was just to get rid
of his 'Manglik' (INAUSPICIOUS) phase.

708
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,230
What about the faults still
left in his birth-chart?

709
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:57,564
And why do you think...

710
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,355
...I am insisting on getting
him a wife with two thumbs?

711
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:02,689
According to the scriptures...

712
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:07,814
...Water, Earth, Sky, Wind, and
Fire. The thumb... represents fire.

713
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,105
Only double fire can absolve the
final faults in his birth-chart.

714
00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:16,192
So... you must marry
someone..-...

715
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,772
...who has 'double fire'
on her left hand.

716
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:20,064
Yeah...

717
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:23,689
This is really
terrible, brother.

718
00:42:25,147 --> 00:42:29,105
I wonder what I did to
deserve this imbecile?

719
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:34,109
Can I say something, brother?

720
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:37,564
I think you should shift in the
barn with sister-in-law Mallika.

721
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,855
I've another idea.

722
00:42:40,314 --> 00:42:41,689
Should I ask Hrithik?

723
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:43,314
Maybe he knows someone.

724
00:42:49,605 --> 00:42:51,025
You know what...

725
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:52,650
...why don't you put up
posters for this too.

726
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,272
"Wanted! With two thumbs."

727
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:58,689
I'm in a real tight spot,
and you think it's funny.

728
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,900
Look... on a serious note...

729
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,442
Why don't you tell
father everything?

730
00:43:03,522 --> 00:43:05,814
Hang me upside down father.

731
00:43:07,105 --> 00:43:10,067
You're 36 years old... and
still scared of your father.

732
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:12,234
Not at all, I'm not
scared of my father.

733
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:14,355
- Really.
- I am scared of myself...

734
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:17,980
If I lose my mind, I swear, I
will make father's life hell.

735
00:43:18,272 --> 00:43:19,105
Of course.

736
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:23,772
Don't you have a solution
on your computer.

737
00:43:23,897 --> 00:43:25,689
For this? No...

738
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,855
Only some quick-fixer can
find a solution to this.

739
00:43:32,772 --> 00:43:36,355
You're right... why move mountains
when we can find a quick-fix for it.

740
00:43:36,605 --> 00:43:38,939
Absolutely right, mister.

741
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:42,022
It's a question
of our image now.

742
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,234
Brother, two cups of
tea... with ginger.

743
00:43:45,314 --> 00:43:46,730
- Make it good.
- Yes.

744
00:43:46,814 --> 00:43:50,064
- Brother, no ginger in mine.
- Okay.

745
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,984
- Listen.
- Yes.

746
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:06,939
- Can you knit?
- Yes, why?

747
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,397
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

748
00:44:23,147 --> 00:44:24,272
Consider it clone.

749
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:31,022
O benevolent Lord,
get me married.

750
00:44:33,397 --> 00:44:37,689
"There isn't a moment of peace without it."
- Keshav.

751
00:44:37,897 --> 00:44:42,314
- Are you dead?
- "Always keeps you on your toes."

752
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:46,105
"Spins around like the
wheel of a cycle."

753
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,855
"Anyone in this predicament
is always happy."

754
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:57,067
"The path of love isn't easy."

755
00:44:57,147 --> 00:45:03,397
"There's nothing more
complicated than love."

756
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:11,272
"There's nothing more
complicated than love."

757
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:28,189
"I got cheated by
my own heart..."

758
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,439
"...and started believing you."

759
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,025
"I got cheated by
my own heart..."

760
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:37,192
"...and started believing you."

761
00:45:37,272 --> 00:45:39,525
"Finally my heart
took the bait..."

762
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:43,564
"...and sacrificed all
its dreams for you."

763
00:45:44,897 --> 00:45:49,359
"Small issue, lots of pain."

764
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,605
"There's nothing more
complicated than love."

765
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:03,105
"There's nothing more
complicated than love."

766
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,397
Just remember three things.

767
00:46:05,522 --> 00:46:08,397
Don't try to scratch with it...
or the nail will come off.

768
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,397
Keep it away from fire,
or it will melt.

769
00:46:10,522 --> 00:46:13,605
And don't use it for legal purposes
it doesn't have a fingerprint.

770
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,775
Not at all. Never.

771
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:17,980
- Congratulations on your wedding, brother.
- Get lost.

772
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:33,689
Impossible!

773
00:46:34,147 --> 00:46:36,272
Just like Hritika Roshan.

774
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,480
Where did you find her?

775
00:46:39,814 --> 00:46:43,230
Father, last night Goddess
Laxmi came in my dreams.

776
00:46:43,397 --> 00:46:45,734
And in the morning when I
went to the riverside...

777
00:46:45,814 --> 00:46:50,022
...this fell on
me from the roof.

778
00:46:50,355 --> 00:46:53,272
When she came looking for this, I
did the smart thing and hid myself.

779
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,730
I swear father, there was
fire emitting from her.

780
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,730
She was double
fire, take a look.

781
00:46:58,855 --> 00:47:01,105
See, this.. See, father.

782
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,397
Father, get me married.

783
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,314
Father...

784
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,022
Come, Come..

785
00:47:25,272 --> 00:47:27,605
Hey stop please.

786
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:28,730
Who is it?

787
00:47:28,814 --> 00:47:30,064
- Bless you.
- Careful.

788
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,939
Come here.

789
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:43,480
[CHANTING PRAYER]

790
00:47:47,522 --> 00:47:49,022
Hurry up. Hurry up.

791
00:47:50,522 --> 00:47:56,064
[CHANTING PRAYER]

792
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,314
Bless you, two. Bless you.

793
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:08,897
- Father... double fire.
- Yes.

794
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,355
Everything's going to
be just delightful now.

795
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:14,355
Not just delightful, now brother's
going to tango every night.

796
00:48:15,522 --> 00:48:17,022
Am I right, Sister-in-law?

797
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:21,022
Brother Keshav, come please.

798
00:48:24,314 --> 00:48:26,355
Congratulation Brother Keshav.

799
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:28,067
Well done..

800
00:48:28,147 --> 00:48:31,022
You are great!

801
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:33,730
Come dance with me.

802
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:35,397
Very good.

803
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:41,355
Brother Keshav, do
the serpent dance.

804
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:46,605
Well done Father..

805
00:48:52,147 --> 00:48:54,355
Hail to Brother keshav!

806
00:48:56,564 --> 00:48:58,064
Dance with me also.

807
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:07,314
Come sister-in-law.

808
00:49:08,314 --> 00:49:09,730
Come brother.

809
00:49:10,689 --> 00:49:12,647
Aunty, your
daughter-in-law's here.

810
00:49:14,689 --> 00:49:16,855
Right foot, sister-in-law...
right foot.

811
00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:19,939
Come, sister-in-law.

812
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,855
Welcome, sister-in-law.
This is our courtyard.

813
00:49:31,022 --> 00:49:32,189
Welcome.

814
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:33,397
Stop-stop-stop.

815
00:49:33,522 --> 00:49:35,064
Let me introduce
you to his first.

816
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:37,814
You're the second wife, not
the first. She's his first.

817
00:49:37,897 --> 00:49:40,067
Her name is Mallika you must
meet and greet her first.

818
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:41,605
You can meet her later.

819
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:42,692
- Come here first.
- This isn't right.

820
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:44,439
Listen to me...

821
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:46,025
You're in a lot of hurry today.

822
00:49:46,105 --> 00:49:47,942
Do you always have to
interfere? Get lost.

823
00:49:48,022 --> 00:49:50,772
I am not going anywhere. I'm
going to sleep in the middle.

824
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:22,647
What is that?

825
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,980
- 'Sande Ka Tel'.
- Shameless.

826
00:50:27,564 --> 00:50:30,189
Here... my mistress sent
this for you. Drink it.

827
00:50:30,314 --> 00:50:32,439
You can't even take
a joke nowadays.

828
00:50:32,605 --> 00:50:34,439
Even you kept me in the dark.

829
00:50:35,105 --> 00:50:36,980
I want a divorce, that's it.

830
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:38,939
<i>1 see...</i>

831
00:50:40,022 --> 00:50:41,234
Let's get on with the
wedding night...

832
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:43,480
...and I'll divorce your
entire family in the morning.

833
00:50:44,897 --> 00:50:47,355
Will you come
quietly... or jump?

834
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:49,480
- Jump.
- <i>Jump!</i>

835
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:55,439
Sister Mallika...

836
00:50:56,022 --> 00:50:58,022
Sister Mallika, help!

837
00:50:59,314 --> 00:51:00,689
Curse those two.

838
00:51:13,064 --> 00:51:14,897
Sister-in-law.

839
00:51:17,064 --> 00:51:18,605
Sister-in-law.

840
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,147
Get up.

841
00:51:22,105 --> 00:51:23,397
Get up.

842
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:26,859
You already woke me up
three times last night.

843
00:51:26,939 --> 00:51:28,939
I am a man, not a machine.

844
00:51:29,772 --> 00:51:30,939
Useless.

845
00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:39,025
Sister-in-law, recognize me?

846
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:41,272
I am Sana. We met
at your wedding.

847
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,775
Yes, Sana, but...

848
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:44,192
It's already 4:15.

849
00:51:44,272 --> 00:51:47,355
Everyone's eagerly waiting to
welcome you to our LOTA party.

850
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,772
Sana, is it going to take long?

851
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:53,314
Get the new daughter-in-law
quickly. It's getting urgent.

852
00:51:54,772 --> 00:51:57,147
You go, Sana. I'll
meet everyone later.

853
00:51:57,439 --> 00:52:00,105
It will be dawn soon.

854
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:02,939
You go, I am coming.

855
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:04,730
Hurry up then.

856
00:52:05,064 --> 00:52:06,522
We've a long way to go.

857
00:52:09,397 --> 00:52:11,355
Wake up. Keshav, wake up.

858
00:52:11,689 --> 00:52:12,417
Wake up!

859
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,650
My dear, are you going to
wake me up like this every day?

860
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:15,939
Why didn't you tell me?

861
00:52:16,147 --> 00:52:18,859
But Naru did tell
you about Mallika?

862
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:20,022
Stop joking.

863
00:52:20,147 --> 00:52:21,775
Why were these women
calling me out?

864
00:52:21,855 --> 00:52:23,689
Don't you have a
toilet in your home?

865
00:52:24,689 --> 00:52:25,480
Toilet?

866
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,064
No toilet... where?

867
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:32,109
There's one in my home.

868
00:52:32,189 --> 00:52:34,064
Why didn't you tell me
before our marriage?

869
00:52:35,939 --> 00:52:36,814
Tell you what?

870
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,814
That you don't have a
toilet in your home.

871
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:42,522
Why are you making
a scene for it?

872
00:52:42,772 --> 00:52:43,939
Where should I go then?

873
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,522
Same place everyone
else is going.

874
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,150
Socialize with everyone, get to
know everyone in the LOTA party.

875
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,397
Be their leader...

876
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,942
Be their leader!

877
00:52:53,022 --> 00:52:56,314
Listen to me. Such
anger for a toilet?

878
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,939
If I had known, I would've
never married you.

879
00:52:59,397 --> 00:53:00,230
Move!

880
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,689
Didn't anyone in the village
build a toilet, Sana?

881
00:53:15,022 --> 00:53:17,147
No, sister-in-law,
there isn't one here.

882
00:53:17,272 --> 00:53:19,192
What's the matter?
Is there a problem?

883
00:53:19,272 --> 00:53:22,355
Don't you think it's a problem...
to defecate out in the open.

884
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,272
But this is important.

885
00:53:24,522 --> 00:53:25,980
How can we do without it?

886
00:53:26,147 --> 00:53:28,230
No walls or doors.

887
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:31,439
- What if someone sees you?
- Now I get it.

888
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:33,817
I guess there's been
an incident with you.

889
00:53:33,897 --> 00:53:35,522
Is everyone waiting for
an incident to happen?

890
00:53:35,689 --> 00:53:37,067
Until then, let things
continue the way they are.

891
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:37,855
Isn't it?

892
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:39,772
Are you two going
to chatter alone?

893
00:53:39,855 --> 00:53:40,980
We're here too.

894
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:43,064
You're really beautiful.

895
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:45,147
Also, you had a love-marriage.

896
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,234
Yes, of course, that's what girls
do when they get educated.

897
00:53:48,314 --> 00:53:50,772
Yes... that's what they
teach us in college.

898
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:52,730
She's got a sharp
tongue, sister.

899
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,147
He was always so predictable.

900
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:58,814
We always knew, Keshav will marry
some English-speaking girl.

901
00:54:00,939 --> 00:54:03,439
- How much further?
- Just a little more, sister-in-law.

902
00:54:05,564 --> 00:54:06,900
What if we have to
go during the day.

903
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,480
Control it.

904
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:12,230
Hurry up, daughter-in-law,
it will be dawn soon.

905
00:54:29,355 --> 00:54:32,647
Will you just stand there and
stare at us, daughter-in-law?

906
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:34,939
Aren't your in-laws feeding you?

907
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,480
She feels embarrassed.

908
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:41,730
Forsake all your inhibitions
and get down to business.

909
00:54:42,855 --> 00:54:44,522
I'm not used to it.

910
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,855
Did your parents build
a palace for you?

911
00:54:47,939 --> 00:54:48,942
You are right.

912
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:52,147
Yes... there was a
toilet in my home.

913
00:54:52,855 --> 00:54:54,064
I can't do this.

914
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:55,484
- Listen...
- Daughter-in-law.

915
00:54:55,564 --> 00:54:57,189
You'll get in trouble later.

916
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:07,980
Just watching television.

917
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:23,272
Come... Father's not at home.

918
00:55:26,897 --> 00:55:28,397
You're still angry with me.

919
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:31,189
Say something.

920
00:55:33,105 --> 00:55:34,814
Why are you making such a scene?

921
00:55:40,189 --> 00:55:42,522
I can't defecate out
in the open, Keshav.

922
00:55:44,939 --> 00:55:46,897
Do something... or I'm leaving.

923
00:56:04,022 --> 00:56:04,855
Father...

924
00:56:05,689 --> 00:56:08,314
..we delivered Gokul's
consignment yesterday.

925
00:56:08,814 --> 00:56:10,605
Some minor things to do.

926
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:13,980
I've called a handyman.
The roof was leaking.

927
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:16,480
And build a small
toilet in the room.

928
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:18,814
- What did you say?
- The spare parts will arrive from Agra...

929
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,814
- Huh?
- What did you say?

930
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,355
Spare parts...

931
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,272
Before that.

932
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:29,189
- The roof was leaking.
- After that?

933
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,439
Build a small toilet...

934
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,897
What happened, father?

935
00:56:41,105 --> 00:56:43,192
I can't swallow a
single morsel...

936
00:56:43,272 --> 00:56:45,605
...if anyone mentions a
toilet while eating.

937
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:52,564
And now our... topper daughter-in-law
wants a loo in our home.

938
00:56:56,439 --> 00:57:00,730
No respect for our culture or knowledge
of our tradition and rituals.

939
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:06,272
Over-education makes
you a failure in life.

940
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,855
- Give me some bread.
- Yes, me too...

941
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,730
What is this?

942
00:57:26,897 --> 00:57:28,439
Father's share of bread...

943
00:57:59,189 --> 00:58:00,480
Go give this to father.

944
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:06,355
Come along, father
will like that.

945
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:09,189
Come.

946
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:25,105
Father, please eat...

947
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:30,730
Stop venting your anger
on food, father.

948
00:58:31,605 --> 00:58:34,105
Daughter-in-law cooked this food
without going to the toilet.

949
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,939
I won't eat this.

950
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,355
By the way, father, if we can have
a living room, a dining room...

951
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:49,022
...then, we can certainly
build a toilet.

952
00:58:49,855 --> 00:58:52,189
Then why take the body
to the crematorium?

953
00:58:52,439 --> 00:58:54,439
You can burn me right
here in our courtyard.

954
00:58:54,522 --> 00:58:56,397
And then build a toilet.

955
00:59:37,522 --> 00:59:39,230
Come Jaya, it's really late.

956
00:59:46,272 --> 00:59:47,147
Jaya...

957
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:49,189
Jaya, I am trying.

958
00:59:49,772 --> 00:59:52,147
I've already put in a
request with father.

959
00:59:56,522 --> 00:59:58,980
Darling... just a few more days.

960
00:59:59,272 --> 01:00:01,147
Soon we'll find a
solution for this.

961
01:00:03,022 --> 01:00:04,064
What solution?

962
01:00:04,439 --> 01:00:07,189
Build a fake toilet,
like the fake thumb.

963
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:10,439
- Trying to make quick-fixes.
- Jaya..

964
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,355
No-no-no... look.

965
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:31,647
Look closely who defecates
out in the open.

966
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,397
There should be some difference.

967
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,689
Here... it's your uncle calling.

968
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:44,689
Tell him... what you thought
was a smartphone...

969
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:46,647
...turned out to
be a small pager.

970
01:00:56,772 --> 01:00:59,814
- Radhe-Radhe, uncle.
- Everything okay.

971
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:03,230
Tell me... how can there be
so much peace in Mandgaon.

972
01:01:03,439 --> 01:01:05,647
We sent a storm from here.

973
01:01:06,064 --> 01:01:09,439
Forget the storm, uncle, I am
preparing for World War 3.

974
01:01:09,647 --> 01:01:12,189
- Have faith in me.
- I do...

975
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:15,855
Keep a firm grip on
those cycle-sellers.

976
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,272
<i>Hmm...</i>

977
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:21,522
Why are you sounding so
low? Is everything alright?

978
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:22,439
Give it to me.

979
01:01:23,439 --> 01:01:24,522
No, uncle.

980
01:01:25,647 --> 01:01:27,647
I was just feeling tired.

981
01:01:27,939 --> 01:01:30,855
Right, I guess you don't
get much sleep these days.

982
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:34,692
Listen, tell Keshav that
Sunny's new film is releasing.

983
01:01:34,772 --> 01:01:35,900
We'll go watch it together.

984
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,692
- Uncle...
- Let me talk properly...

985
01:01:37,772 --> 01:01:40,064
Dear... is everything fine?

986
01:01:42,272 --> 01:01:45,189
- Yes..
- When are you coming home?

987
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:49,772
Hello-hello.

988
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:51,355
- Hello.
- What happened?

989
01:01:58,814 --> 01:02:02,605
There's always a villain
in every love story.

990
01:02:02,939 --> 01:02:06,355
And in my case, it's the toilet.

991
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:09,230
I must fix this
once and for all.

992
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,397
I have an idea.

993
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,897
Take your problem
to the Pradhan.

994
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,064
Get out of here... the Pradhan.

995
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:22,689
Pradhan!

996
01:02:25,189 --> 01:02:27,814
[FOLK SONG]

997
01:02:29,939 --> 01:02:32,272
[FOLK SONG]

998
01:02:35,564 --> 01:02:38,189
I'm asking you for the fourth time. Why
bring me here at the crack of dawn?

999
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,689
Wait, sweetheart. Be patient.

1000
01:02:40,897 --> 01:02:43,772
Everyone must change with time.

1001
01:02:44,272 --> 01:02:46,025
I've heard she's well educated.

1002
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:47,855
Are you planning on letting
her take up a job as well?

1003
01:02:47,939 --> 01:02:48,814
<i>Oh, no...</i>

1004
01:02:49,355 --> 01:02:52,022
It's up to her. She can
do what she wants.

1005
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:54,147
Jaya, go and meet
grandma upstairs.

1006
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,359
She's bedridden and can't
move or walk. Go on.

1007
01:02:57,439 --> 01:02:59,147
Yes, why not.

1008
01:03:00,189 --> 01:03:02,939
That's why they had to build
a toilet in grandma's room.

1009
01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:04,192
I'll send her.

1010
01:03:04,272 --> 01:03:07,525
No-no, she will manage
herself. Go on.

1011
01:03:07,605 --> 01:03:09,064
Don't be hasty.

1012
01:03:09,272 --> 01:03:10,942
Haste makes waste.

1013
01:03:11,022 --> 01:03:12,564
Right, wifey, right.

1014
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,397
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1015
01:04:13,647 --> 01:04:15,355
What now? What are you
fuming about now?

1016
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:16,397
It's nothing.

1017
01:04:18,147 --> 01:04:19,814
What do you want?

1018
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,897
What kind of a question is that?
Don't you know what I want?

1019
01:04:24,272 --> 01:04:27,647
I felt like a thief
just to go to the loo.

1020
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,397
- You've made my life miserable.
- I can say the same for you.

1021
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:33,192
You've done me a big
favor by marrying me.

1022
01:04:33,272 --> 01:04:35,147
And now I must tolerate
your educated tantrums.

1023
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,480
What?

1024
01:04:37,105 --> 01:04:39,605
You really think I am
throwing tantrums.

1025
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:43,272
Isn't a woman even entitled
to a toilet in her home?

1026
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,817
For years women have
been adjusting...

1027
01:04:44,897 --> 01:04:46,730
...to the methods practiced
in her in-law's home.

1028
01:04:46,939 --> 01:04:48,647
It's nothing new.

1029
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:51,855
Education has got to your head.

1030
01:04:54,772 --> 01:04:56,359
Chaubey, check the tubes
before you buy them.

1031
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:58,022
Or else we'll get the
defective stuff again.

1032
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,272
Brother, did you get
the bike serviced?

1033
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,022
Father has to leave for Mathura.

1034
01:05:02,564 --> 01:05:04,730
Wouldn't I rather
sabotage the brakes?

1035
01:05:05,522 --> 01:05:06,522
Here.

1036
01:05:06,897 --> 01:05:08,647
And don't forget to
wash the lunchbox.

1037
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:16,772
Frankly speaking, brother, God has
put you in a really fine mess.

1038
01:05:17,397 --> 01:05:19,939
I'm sure he wrote
my fate in the loo.

1039
01:05:20,272 --> 01:05:22,355
Yes... and flushed it too.

1040
01:05:25,064 --> 01:05:27,442
You know what, brother
why don't you buy...

1041
01:05:27,522 --> 01:05:29,605
...sister-in-law her
own personal field?

1042
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,605
That way, you can have
your cake and eat it too.

1043
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,689
Have you lost your mind?

1044
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:37,897
- Go mind your own business.
- Don't come asking me for advice again.

1045
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,439
Keshav. Keshav, wake up.

1046
01:05:45,564 --> 01:05:46,525
Keshav, wake up.

1047
01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:48,025
- Wake up. Wake up.
- What's wrong? Is it an earthquake?

1048
01:05:48,105 --> 01:05:49,772
- Take me to the field quickly.
- Field.

1049
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,359
No 'ifs' or 'buts'.

1050
01:05:51,439 --> 01:05:53,772
This is not the time for
your tantrums. Let's go.

1051
01:05:54,814 --> 01:05:55,814
I am sorry.

1052
01:05:56,897 --> 01:05:59,064
I was very rude
to you yesterday.

1053
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,189
- I apologize.
- Doesn't matter. Let's go.

1054
01:06:04,272 --> 01:06:06,397
By the way, the fields
are very romantic.

1055
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:08,855
- We can romance...
- This is no time to be Shahrukh Khan.

1056
01:06:18,522 --> 01:06:20,230
Curses.

1057
01:06:21,814 --> 01:06:23,814
Radhe-Radhe.

1058
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,022
I'm right here.

1059
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,147
Good luck.

1060
01:07:44,522 --> 01:07:45,772
Father!

1061
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:27,939
Peel these.

1062
01:08:33,272 --> 01:08:34,525
Are you clone with
your work in Mathura?

1063
01:08:34,605 --> 01:08:36,272
- First wash my hands.
- Yes.

1064
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:46,689
What's all the racket about?

1065
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:33,272
Clear your throat for good.

1066
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:39,105
Father.

1067
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:45,897
She's just tensed about what
happened today in the field.

1068
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,359
You're worried about
what happened to her.

1069
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:50,605
And what about the fact that
I fell in a pile of garbage.

1070
01:09:51,272 --> 01:09:52,814
These things happen.

1071
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,230
Don't complicate things.
It wasn't so serious.

1072
01:09:56,397 --> 01:09:58,230
Daughter-in-law did
cover her face.

1073
01:09:58,397 --> 01:09:59,897
- Then.
- I see...

1074
01:10:01,105 --> 01:10:03,105
That's a fine example, father.

1075
01:10:03,272 --> 01:10:06,855
Then we don't need to cover our
faces anymore in this house!

1076
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,439
Jaya.

1077
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:15,730
Father...

1078
01:10:32,064 --> 01:10:35,772
Brother... are you planning to
jump in front of the train?

1079
01:10:37,564 --> 01:10:38,272
No...

1080
01:10:39,772 --> 01:10:42,605
I'm thinking of throwing
you in front of the train.

1081
01:10:43,855 --> 01:10:46,480
Why didn't you stop me
from getting married?

1082
01:10:47,064 --> 01:10:49,605
That doesn't make sense.
Why would I stop you?

1083
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,897
First of all, I am not getting
married because of you.

1084
01:10:52,272 --> 01:10:55,564
Father was the hurdle in your
life. And you're in mine.

1085
01:10:56,647 --> 01:10:57,897
He's been married twice.

1086
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,689
But no one's concerned about me.

1087
01:10:59,897 --> 01:11:01,734
My brother, you don't
know how happy you are.

1088
01:11:01,814 --> 01:11:02,980
I don't want to be happy.

1089
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:05,189
Even I was overexcited
to get married.

1090
01:11:05,564 --> 01:11:06,439
And I did.

1091
01:11:06,522 --> 01:11:09,272
You can see how she's
turned my life into hell.

1092
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:10,897
What are you saying, brother?

1093
01:11:11,064 --> 01:11:13,442
Your wife's one in a million.

1094
01:11:13,522 --> 01:11:16,814
It's better not to have
one..not like her.

1095
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,105
She's got my life
trapped in an urn.

1096
01:11:20,772 --> 01:11:22,317
Stop discussing our
family problems outside.

1097
01:11:22,397 --> 01:11:23,980
What family problems?

1098
01:11:26,105 --> 01:11:29,605
When there's a problem at home a man's
going to vent it out somewhere.

1099
01:11:30,355 --> 01:11:31,439
Right, Rastogi.

1100
01:11:31,522 --> 01:11:33,609
What happened, brother? Be
a little more specific.

1101
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,355
How about I tell you in detail?

1102
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,564
- Stop provoking brother, you rascal.
- Naru!

1103
01:11:38,814 --> 01:11:40,272
Show some respect.

1104
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:44,314
He's 35 years older than you.

1105
01:11:46,689 --> 01:11:47,897
Shameless...

1106
01:11:48,022 --> 01:11:51,439
It's nothing, Rastogi.
Life's a big mess.

1107
01:11:51,772 --> 01:11:53,314
Will you be a little
more specific?

1108
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:54,939
Who made a mess and where?

1109
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,147
I am stuck.

1110
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:01,064
Actually, your poor sister-in-law
isn't asking for too much.

1111
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:02,355
One toilet.

1112
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:07,567
I am ready to give her open fields,
the jungle, trees and bushes.

1113
01:12:07,647 --> 01:12:08,647
But no...

1114
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:14,105
She insists on a 4x8 toi... let.

1115
01:12:15,272 --> 01:12:17,564
Bloody hell.. Where do
I get her a toilet?

1116
01:12:17,647 --> 01:12:18,525
So that's the problem.

1117
01:12:18,605 --> 01:12:22,272
It's not a problem,
its blasphemy.

1118
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:24,355
And then there's Panditji.

1119
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:27,772
He's like the permanent
problem in my life.

1120
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:30,314
He's like father-in-law
from hell.

1121
01:12:31,022 --> 01:12:33,605
I pray no one has to go
through this ordeal.

1122
01:12:33,897 --> 01:12:36,314
They have made my life hell.

1123
01:12:37,022 --> 01:12:38,689
Look, brother Keshav,
my advice to you is...

1124
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:41,564
...take sister-in-law to
Gorakhpur, to see your grandma.

1125
01:12:41,814 --> 01:12:44,397
The train halts for 7
minutes in your village.

1126
01:12:44,564 --> 01:12:46,980
So... when do I
book your tickets?

1127
01:12:47,272 --> 01:12:50,522
- I don't want to go anywhere.
- Give it to me.

1128
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:51,647
Okay.

1129
01:13:00,939 --> 01:13:01,939
What did you say?

1130
01:13:02,814 --> 01:13:05,189
- How long will the train halt?
- 7 minutes.

1131
01:13:06,814 --> 01:13:08,897
- Will the train halt for 7 minutes?
- Yes.

1132
01:13:30,189 --> 01:13:33,105
Remember our first
meeting and climb up.

1133
01:13:33,397 --> 01:13:34,897
Go on, you have seven minutes.

1134
01:13:39,814 --> 01:13:44,067
"Your love's slowly
growing on me."

1135
01:13:44,147 --> 01:13:48,272
"Like ginger blends
with the morning tea."

1136
01:13:48,397 --> 01:13:52,022
"Your love's slowly
growing on me."

1137
01:13:52,564 --> 01:13:56,689
"Like ginger blends
with the morning tea."

1138
01:13:57,147 --> 01:14:02,689
"I eagerly wait for you, like for
the morning rays in winter."

1139
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:08,484
"I'm prepared to ride all
the way to the moon."

1140
01:14:08,564 --> 01:14:10,817
"The morning train..."

1141
01:14:10,897 --> 01:14:14,067
"Your love's like
the morning train."

1142
01:14:14,147 --> 01:14:16,525
"The morning train..."

1143
01:14:16,605 --> 01:14:19,689
"Your love's like
the morning train."

1144
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,150
"I stay awake all night..."

1145
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:25,359
"Your love's like
the morning train."

1146
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:27,817
"The morning train..."

1147
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:31,772
"Your love's like
the morning train."

1148
01:14:32,814 --> 01:14:34,022
It's three...

1149
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:35,442
- Oh, God!
- Yes.

1150
01:14:35,522 --> 01:14:37,814
- I won.
- What is this? I don't want to play.

1151
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:39,647
You know what, you go.

1152
01:14:39,772 --> 01:14:41,564
Your sister-in-law and
I are going to play.

1153
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:43,692
Where are you taking the game?

1154
01:14:43,772 --> 01:14:44,609
Brother's going to play
another games with you now.

1155
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,397
How are we going to play now?

1156
01:14:47,064 --> 01:14:48,064
Let’s Play-

1157
01:15:00,147 --> 01:15:05,314
"We set out before dawn."

1158
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:11,192
"Let the world be envy."

1159
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:16,314
"We set out before dawn."

1160
01:15:17,064 --> 01:15:22,230
"Let the world be envy."

1161
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:25,192
"The heart keeps chugging."

1162
01:15:25,272 --> 01:15:27,984
"Keeps stopping on the way."

1163
01:15:28,064 --> 01:15:30,775
"The heart keeps chugging."

1164
01:15:30,855 --> 01:15:33,359
"Keeps stopping on the way."

1165
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:38,734
"And sometimes beats fast
like an express train."

1166
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:41,275
"The morning train..."

1167
01:15:41,355 --> 01:15:43,442
"Your love's like
the morning train."

1168
01:15:43,522 --> 01:15:44,689
- Keshav.
- Yes, father.

1169
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:50,522
Give this to the Pradhan when you
go out for one of your joyrides.

1170
01:15:50,605 --> 01:15:51,397
Yes.

1171
01:15:52,522 --> 01:15:53,522
Oh no!

1172
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:56,897
- We're late today.
- No, we're not.

1173
01:15:57,022 --> 01:15:59,564
I'll just go deliver this
to the Pradhan. Okay.

1174
01:16:01,064 --> 01:16:03,355
- Come back soon.
- I'll be back in a jiffy.

1175
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,442
Check the next
compartment, dear.

1176
01:16:11,522 --> 01:16:13,314
- You'll find an empty one.
- Thank you.

1177
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,022
Move. Move, mister.

1178
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:17,980
Read it.

1179
01:16:26,105 --> 01:16:28,647
- Hurry up.
- The train's about to leave.

1180
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,897
- Radhe-Radhe, Pradhan.
- Radhe-Radhe, son.

1181
01:16:45,022 --> 01:16:46,192
What brings you here so early
in the morning, Keshav.

1182
01:16:46,272 --> 01:16:50,025
Father sent these documents
for attestation.

1183
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,525
Take a seat... let's have
a cup of tea. Vimla.

1184
01:16:52,605 --> 01:16:54,897
No-no-no... not now. I'm
getting late. Maybe next time.

1185
01:16:55,147 --> 01:16:58,647
Take a seat, it's not like
you've to catch a train.

1186
01:17:05,897 --> 01:17:06,855
What...

1187
01:17:10,064 --> 01:17:11,150
- Okay, see you then.
- Okay.

1188
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:11,980
Radhe-Radhe.

1189
01:17:12,064 --> 01:17:13,939
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1190
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:17,442
I only want the betterment
of this village.

1191
01:17:17,522 --> 01:17:19,522
That's true. Anything
for this village...

1192
01:17:43,897 --> 01:17:45,355
Open the door!

1193
01:18:01,605 --> 01:18:03,855
Quickly. The train's
leaving, Open the door!

1194
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,525
- Open the door.
- Yes, we're moving it.

1195
01:18:07,605 --> 01:18:08,734
Open the door.

1196
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,525
The train's leaving,
Open the door!

1197
01:18:10,605 --> 01:18:12,525
Yes, we're moving it.

1198
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,442
Get everything aside.

1199
01:18:14,522 --> 01:18:16,564
- Move.
- Yes, we're moving it.

1200
01:18:28,564 --> 01:18:30,272
Keep it here...

1201
01:18:31,355 --> 01:18:32,480
Come... come..

1202
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,064
Jaya, get down.

1203
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,689
Jaya, pull the chain.

1204
01:19:01,064 --> 01:19:02,647
Pull the chain!

1205
01:19:03,522 --> 01:19:04,939
Pull the chain!

1206
01:19:06,605 --> 01:19:07,814
Jaya!

1207
01:19:08,605 --> 01:19:09,814
Jaya!

1208
01:19:10,564 --> 01:19:12,605
Jaya! What are you
doing? Pull the chain.

1209
01:19:14,772 --> 01:19:17,064
We're running out of platform.

1210
01:19:19,564 --> 01:19:21,272
Pull the chain!

1211
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:29,522
Jaya.

1212
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:36,522
Jaya. Pull the chain!

1213
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:11,397
Shooting.. Shooting..

1214
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:17,730
Even if you call 100 times you'll
get the same answer, Keshav.

1215
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:18,984
I am not coming back.

1216
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,564
Think about the rumor
people are going to spread.

1217
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:24,064
Keshav's wife left
him for a toilet.

1218
01:20:24,147 --> 01:20:27,272
Will you feel proud if your
wife defecates out in the open?

1219
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:29,439
You're getting it all wrong.

1220
01:20:29,897 --> 01:20:31,689
We'll find a way.

1221
01:20:31,897 --> 01:20:33,272
You mean another quick-fix.

1222
01:20:33,564 --> 01:20:35,650
When in love, the best
solution is to run away.

1223
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,689
Fake thumb for marriage and,
using the loo on the train.

1224
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:40,314
Listen carefully, Keshav.

1225
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,314
No more quick-fixes.

1226
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,772
Find a permanent solution.

1227
01:20:43,855 --> 01:20:47,272
You know what, you can take your
demands and sit in your toilet.

1228
01:20:47,397 --> 01:20:48,522
Okay. Okay.

1229
01:20:52,439 --> 01:20:57,022
See... she's publicly
embarrassed us.

1230
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:58,439
What happened, father?

1231
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,730
Read, son. Read.

1232
01:21:01,897 --> 01:21:04,189
She's made us Pandit's so proud.

1233
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:07,230
- Your grandma called.
- Yes.

1234
01:21:07,397 --> 01:21:09,022
She's coming down from
Gorakhpur next week.

1235
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:09,855
Yes, father.

1236
01:21:12,605 --> 01:21:15,192
She just made a big
joke out of us.

1237
01:21:15,272 --> 01:21:16,272
Brother.. look..

1238
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:19,064
Tell him, Naru.

1239
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:21,522
Now he must take care
of the household.

1240
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:23,772
Couldn't even take
care of his wife.

1241
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:28,105
She's not some piece of cloth
which needs to be taken care of.

1242
01:21:28,814 --> 01:21:29,855
Come on.

1243
01:21:30,605 --> 01:21:32,480
He's only good for
cleaning up dung.

1244
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:35,564
Only animals are allowed
to shit in this courtyard.

1245
01:21:35,772 --> 01:21:37,192
Which scoundrel
published this news?

1246
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:39,192
We've been betrayed
by one of our own.

1247
01:21:39,272 --> 01:21:40,564
Rastogi from Jagran.

1248
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:45,192
- Brother Keshav.
- Bloody traitor...

1249
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:47,439
How dare you!

1250
01:21:47,855 --> 01:21:51,150
How dare you
humiliate my family!

1251
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:52,775
- Now he's got the respect he deserved.
- Brother, please...

1252
01:21:52,855 --> 01:21:54,109
Come on.

1253
01:21:54,189 --> 01:21:58,064
Whatever I did, was
for your own good.

1254
01:21:58,397 --> 01:22:01,192
Shut it down. Shut it
down. Go back inside.

1255
01:22:01,272 --> 01:22:02,605
You bloody...

1256
01:22:02,814 --> 01:22:04,275
Speak up!

1257
01:22:04,355 --> 01:22:06,314
- Tell me.
- Listen to me, brother, please...

1258
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:08,609
I'll tell you if you
stop hitting me.

1259
01:22:08,689 --> 01:22:10,314
Speak up. Yes, tell me.

1260
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:11,814
Listen to me...

1261
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,314
This news would've
been out soon enough.

1262
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,314
My newspaper didn't
expose some hidden scam.

1263
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:23,272
Thanks to your newspaper. Those
who didn't know also know.

1264
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,314
Just wait and watch...

1265
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:27,400
...sister-in-law will come
back home due to this article.

1266
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,314
How?

1267
01:22:28,939 --> 01:22:31,730
The bride's family never likes to
see such news in the newspaper.

1268
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:33,150
There must be chaos
in their house.

1269
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:34,230
All of them must be
completely shaken.

1270
01:22:41,105 --> 01:22:42,772
'You said...'

1271
01:22:43,022 --> 01:22:46,022
Can someone please lower the volume so
we can discuss more important issues?

1272
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:50,230
These so called 'important' issues
are what's ruining the country.

1273
01:22:50,522 --> 01:22:53,275
"How long are we going
to mourn and cry."

1274
01:22:53,355 --> 01:22:56,189
"Pull up the blanket over
your head and sleep."

1275
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:57,980
Please stay quiet.

1276
01:22:58,689 --> 01:22:59,984
I can't hear the
dialogues, mother.

1277
01:23:00,064 --> 01:23:02,109
Of course, just listen
to the dialogues.

1278
01:23:02,189 --> 01:23:03,814
Did anyone read
today's newspapers?

1279
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,772
What is everyone's
opinion about it?

1280
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:09,314
This is Kakka's contribution in 'Swacchta
Abhiyan' (CLEAN INDIA MOVEMENT).

1281
01:23:09,397 --> 01:23:12,605
Today's newspaper was fit to
be used as waste and so I did.

1282
01:23:12,772 --> 01:23:17,314
Waste should always go into
the wastepaper basket.

1283
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:19,147
- 'They will die for you?
- Yes.'

1284
01:23:20,147 --> 01:23:23,189
'But I am not like
them. I am different.'

1285
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:28,814
My thumb.

1286
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:41,897
Daughter-in-law's thumb?

1287
01:23:48,855 --> 01:23:50,855
What if Rastogi's
right, brother?

1288
01:23:51,147 --> 01:23:53,317
Maybe sister-in-law will come
back after reading this news.

1289
01:23:53,397 --> 01:23:54,980
She won't.

1290
01:23:55,147 --> 01:23:57,272
I wonder how many times I
will still get humiliated...

1291
01:23:57,297 --> 01:23:58,004
Useless!

1292
01:23:59,147 --> 01:24:01,564
Both of you are useless!

1293
01:24:01,855 --> 01:24:02,980
Useless!

1294
01:24:04,022 --> 01:24:05,772
This...

1295
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,230
This fake thumb that you made...

1296
01:24:09,564 --> 01:24:11,605
It's not for me or religion.

1297
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:16,564
She left it behind for
you, your topper madam.

1298
01:24:16,897 --> 01:24:23,022
And now... even the Lord
can't absolve your troubles.

1299
01:24:23,272 --> 01:24:24,814
- But, father, sister-in-law only...
- Shut up.

1300
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,942
Don't you dare mention
her name here again?

1301
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:28,897
Yes, father.

1302
01:24:30,564 --> 01:24:32,939
They want show
religion the finger.

1303
01:24:33,522 --> 01:24:34,689
Stop pretending!

1304
01:24:35,855 --> 01:24:37,314
Get up brother.

1305
01:24:55,605 --> 01:24:57,564
Field clear.. silence.

1306
01:24:57,647 --> 01:24:58,234
Taking.

1307
01:24:58,314 --> 01:25:00,192
- Ready, sir.
- Action.

1308
01:25:00,272 --> 01:25:02,105
Do I look stupid to you?

1309
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,230
- I'm sorry.
- What sorry.

1310
01:25:11,772 --> 01:25:13,317
You think I can't see.

1311
01:25:13,397 --> 01:25:15,564
You were flirting with her,
I saw it with my own eyes.

1312
01:25:17,105 --> 01:25:19,105
You don't trust me.
You trust me right?

1313
01:25:25,522 --> 01:25:26,314
I love you.

1314
01:25:26,397 --> 01:25:27,105
Cut it.

1315
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:32,814
I see... so these oversized
boxes are toilets.

1316
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,272
Your sister-in-law will be
really comfortable in this.

1317
01:25:38,314 --> 01:25:38,939
Huh?

1318
01:25:39,564 --> 01:25:42,355
Brother, I don't think
your intentions are good.

1319
01:25:43,564 --> 01:25:45,855
Careful. Careful.

1320
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:47,689
Pull.. Pull..

1321
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,484
How do you feel carrying a loo
on your shoulders, Rastogi?

1322
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:53,939
- I feel like Mother India.
- I see...

1323
01:25:54,064 --> 01:25:56,397
Brother Keshav, it looks new.

1324
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:58,897
Don't publish this
in your newspaper.

1325
01:25:59,064 --> 01:26:03,400
Brother, after that beating, I'll
only print what you tell me to.

1326
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,817
Brother, what if they file a
complaint with the police?

1327
01:26:05,897 --> 01:26:07,564
Only if they find it.

1328
01:26:07,855 --> 01:26:09,897
Where will we hide it?

1329
01:26:10,147 --> 01:26:12,734
We'll hide it in our
courtyard for a day or two.

1330
01:26:12,814 --> 01:26:13,397
And cover it.

1331
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,022
Later, when father leaves for
Agra we'll shift it in my room.

1332
01:26:16,105 --> 01:26:16,772
Come on.

1333
01:26:46,189 --> 01:26:47,814
Can't live without me?

1334
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:49,564
There's something I
want to tell you.

1335
01:26:49,689 --> 01:26:51,855
That's what phones are for.

1336
01:26:52,314 --> 01:26:53,522
Not like this.

1337
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:54,855
Let's meet.

1338
01:26:55,314 --> 01:26:56,397
What is it this time?

1339
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,855
Some quick-fix again.

1340
01:26:58,022 --> 01:27:00,480
No quick-fix... this time
I've come up with an idea.

1341
01:27:01,272 --> 01:27:02,272
Can we meet?

1342
01:27:03,105 --> 01:27:04,189
Then come home.

1343
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:05,480
I won't come home.

1344
01:27:05,772 --> 01:27:07,272
Things will just
get complicated.

1345
01:27:07,897 --> 01:27:09,564
Why? Are you feeling
embarrassed?

1346
01:27:09,939 --> 01:27:11,855
Fine, let's meet tonight.

1347
01:27:12,105 --> 01:27:12,855
Why?

1348
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:14,855
Are you embarrassed to
meet me during the day?

1349
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:15,942
Of course, I am.

1350
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,189
I don't want people to
think that I gave in.

1351
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:22,689
So where are we going to
meet my beloved wife?

1352
01:27:24,147 --> 01:27:25,939
Near the field with the tower.

1353
01:27:26,355 --> 01:27:28,355
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1354
01:27:34,064 --> 01:27:38,397
Are you enjoying, meeting secretly
like this even though we're married.

1355
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,272
Yeah... I've been having
fun for 36 years, madam.

1356
01:27:41,647 --> 01:27:44,564
I used all the tricks up my sleeve
to get a wife but she left me too.

1357
01:27:45,647 --> 01:27:47,897
We should've eloped instead.

1358
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,564
This distance is
taking effect on you.

1359
01:27:52,814 --> 01:27:55,397
So tell me... why did
you call me here?

1360
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:58,480
Better prepare yourself
to come back home.

1361
01:27:58,564 --> 01:28:00,647
I just solved this
problem permanently.

1362
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:03,064
I see... How?

1363
01:28:03,314 --> 01:28:04,564
See for yourself.

1364
01:28:05,022 --> 01:28:08,980
Soon I'll take you back home,
like wedding procession.

1365
01:28:09,272 --> 01:28:11,855
You could've said
this over the phone.

1366
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:19,147
I wanted to see you.

1367
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:22,480
But not me.

1368
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:28,314
Why are you on-line
last night at 12:30?

1369
01:28:28,855 --> 01:28:31,189
Were you watching
my profile picture?

1370
01:28:31,522 --> 01:28:35,605
You must have run your fingers
on my photo, like this.

1371
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,689
I see... how do you know?

1372
01:28:42,730 --> 01:28:44,230
Were you keeping an eye on me?

1373
01:28:45,314 --> 01:28:48,814
I have a drone hovering
over your father's home.

1374
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:50,814
And it keeps telling me.

1375
01:28:51,855 --> 01:28:57,189
You know, since the day I left, I've
been sleeping embracing your picture.

1376
01:28:57,439 --> 01:28:59,397
So... stop doing it until
day-after-tomorrow.

1377
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,314
- Why?
- Everyone will think that you gave in.

1378
01:29:11,314 --> 01:29:12,897
Your phone's vibrating.

1379
01:29:16,022 --> 01:29:17,147
Hold on.

1380
01:29:19,314 --> 01:29:20,647
Speak up, bloody jinx.

1381
01:29:32,272 --> 01:29:34,064
Now you guys are stealing
toilets as well.

1382
01:29:34,564 --> 01:29:38,022
Because of people like you even mugs
have to be chained in train's toilets.

1383
01:29:38,147 --> 01:29:42,397
Fine, but I don't want to stand out
in the open like you guys and pee.

1384
01:29:43,189 --> 01:29:44,522
Are you listening to his taunts?

1385
01:29:45,189 --> 01:29:47,230
You take the necessary
action, Inspector.

1386
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,522
He has tainted my religion.

1387
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:51,189
By bringing this sin home?

1388
01:29:51,272 --> 01:29:53,442
They have been committing the
sin till now, Inspector.

1389
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:55,192
What did his
daughter-in-law do wrong?

1390
01:29:55,272 --> 01:29:57,230
Only animals defecate
out in the open.

1391
01:29:58,105 --> 01:29:59,314
<i>1 see...</i>

1392
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:06,814
I raised him into this
37-year-old man that he is now.

1393
01:30:06,897 --> 01:30:09,730
And now you think it's wrong
to defecate out in the open.

1394
01:30:10,189 --> 01:30:13,189
You're right. You
raised me to be a man.

1395
01:30:14,064 --> 01:30:16,522
That's why I never
thought about women.

1396
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:21,772
Let him stay in jail.

1397
01:30:32,189 --> 01:30:34,234
Grandma. Grandma,
come in. Please.

1398
01:30:34,314 --> 01:30:37,275
- Come in. Please.
- I will never cross this threshold!

1399
01:30:37,355 --> 01:30:38,855
I just came here to say..

1400
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:41,814
..that you've raised your
daughter with some great values.

1401
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:45,397
Keshav stole a loo for her.

1402
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:48,689
And now he's locked up
in jail, for stealing.

1403
01:30:49,105 --> 01:30:50,234
And this princess...

1404
01:30:50,314 --> 01:30:53,105
She's sitting in her
home, over a loo.

1405
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:55,397
Unbelievable, grandma.

1406
01:30:55,689 --> 01:30:57,234
You're saying this even
though you're a woman.

1407
01:30:57,314 --> 01:31:00,650
I'm saying this because I am a woman.
We've to compromise all the time.

1408
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:02,275
That's the plight of women.

1409
01:31:02,355 --> 01:31:04,855
But she left her home.
That's not the way.

1410
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:07,689
This never happened in
our village before.

1411
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,689
Out on your joyride again-.

1412
01:31:11,564 --> 01:31:14,730
The men can do it right
in their backyard.

1413
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,314
But we're women.

1414
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:18,855
We've to work harder
for everything.

1415
01:31:19,022 --> 01:31:19,980
Isn't it?

1416
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:22,230
We're expected to make
all the compromises.

1417
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,439
Because that's what our
culture teaches us.

1418
01:31:24,605 --> 01:31:25,984
Control your urges.

1419
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,814
Wait for nightfall.

1420
01:31:28,105 --> 01:31:30,150
Men can do it during the clay, but
you got to do it in the dark.

1421
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:31,355
But stay quiet!

1422
01:31:32,814 --> 01:31:36,067
If men look at you with lusty
eyes then just cover your faces..

1423
01:31:36,147 --> 01:31:37,314
..but stay quiet!

1424
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,775
And when some pervert
flashes his torch at you...

1425
01:31:39,855 --> 01:31:41,814
...then cover your faces, rather
than covering your backside!

1426
01:31:42,064 --> 01:31:43,900
So that he can go to
his friends and say...

1427
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:46,439
"I caught a glimpse, but
don't know who it was."

1428
01:31:48,314 --> 01:31:50,025
Every day they kept flashing
their headlights at you...

1429
01:31:50,105 --> 01:31:51,689
...but it never struck you.

1430
01:31:52,314 --> 01:31:56,689
You're happy because LOTA party
has a new agenda to discuss!

1431
01:31:58,897 --> 01:32:00,355
This is okay Neelam.

1432
01:32:00,939 --> 01:32:03,105
If you're having periods,
stay out of the temple.

1433
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:04,897
If there's a pyre burning we
stay out of the crematorium.

1434
01:32:05,022 --> 01:32:07,147
And if we want to relieve
ourselves go outside the village.

1435
01:32:07,564 --> 01:32:08,480
Why?

1436
01:32:09,147 --> 01:32:12,314
Why make these rules?
Why only for us?

1437
01:32:14,647 --> 01:32:18,234
It was their fault... but
now, it's our fault!

1438
01:32:18,314 --> 01:32:19,484
What do you want, Jaya?

1439
01:32:19,564 --> 01:32:20,980
Do you expect us to leave
our home like you?

1440
01:32:21,147 --> 01:32:23,147
We don't have a toilet
even in our parent's home.

1441
01:32:23,397 --> 01:32:24,397
I don't know.

1442
01:32:24,647 --> 01:32:26,564
I only found a solution
to my problem.

1443
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:29,480
But the rest of you don't even
realize that you're in trouble!

1444
01:32:30,897 --> 01:32:33,397
Someday... Someday you will be
reduced to ashes in these urns.

1445
01:32:33,689 --> 01:32:35,772
Even now you're trapped
in it while you're alive!

1446
01:32:42,022 --> 01:32:44,314
Serve water to your
husband in this urn...

1447
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:48,939
...and we'll see... whether
they make a scene, or not.

1448
01:33:17,897 --> 01:33:19,480
- Come, sir.
- Please.

1449
01:33:20,897 --> 01:33:23,442
- Brother.
- Hello, sir.

1450
01:33:23,522 --> 01:33:24,522
Yeah...

1451
01:33:26,689 --> 01:33:27,855
Jaya.

1452
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:33,689
- Sir...
- Yes, thank you.

1453
01:33:38,355 --> 01:33:40,772
This was your solution
to my problem?

1454
01:33:43,397 --> 01:33:45,480
Do me a favor, Keshav.

1455
01:33:46,647 --> 01:33:49,272
No more quick-fixes for me.

1456
01:33:52,522 --> 01:33:53,772
Forgive me.

1457
01:33:53,897 --> 01:33:55,397
Don't say that, Jaya.

1458
01:34:02,772 --> 01:34:06,647
Strange, you're bailing out
the guy who stole your loo.

1459
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,855
No thief in the world will
steal a toilet, Inspector.

1460
01:34:11,105 --> 01:34:11,980
<i>1 see...</i>

1461
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:13,855
Okay.

1462
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:16,189
- Let Keshav go.
- Thank you, sir.

1463
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:30,689
Come, brother. I guess
it's going to rain.

1464
01:34:31,147 --> 01:34:32,564
Let it rain, Naru.

1465
01:34:33,314 --> 01:34:36,314
Even the Lord's taunting me now.

1466
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:40,772
Guess you're drunk...
you're not in your senses.

1467
01:34:41,355 --> 01:34:45,355
I am drunk... and even
more determined now.

1468
01:34:56,772 --> 01:34:57,897
- Mom.
- Yes.

1469
01:34:58,022 --> 01:34:59,939
Where's my silver-waistband?

1470
01:35:00,689 --> 01:35:01,980
<i>Wow...</i>

1471
01:35:02,064 --> 01:35:05,355
If Keshav sees you today he
will take you back home.

1472
01:35:05,772 --> 01:35:07,025
Let him come.

1473
01:35:07,105 --> 01:35:08,772
I will break his
head with the stick.

1474
01:35:08,855 --> 01:35:10,022
Listen...

1475
01:35:10,355 --> 01:35:12,314
He isn't asking for dowry.

1476
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:14,605
Or raised his hand on you?

1477
01:35:15,314 --> 01:35:18,105
He loves you, think about it.

1478
01:35:18,355 --> 01:35:20,314
End this right here
and go back home.

1479
01:35:20,439 --> 01:35:22,022
You've made things more
complicated than it is.

1480
01:35:22,105 --> 01:35:23,105
Complicated?

1481
01:35:23,772 --> 01:35:26,189
Bravo, Vidya. Bravo.

1482
01:35:26,397 --> 01:35:29,314
Do you know what happened
with the kids in Badhai?

1483
01:35:29,564 --> 01:35:31,480
Poor kids went out
in the evening.

1484
01:35:31,605 --> 01:35:33,772
They were raped and
hung from the tree.

1485
01:35:33,939 --> 01:35:36,984
And a 17-year-old girl in
Jharkhand, committed suicide.

1486
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:40,064
Why? Because her father
didn't build a toilet.

1487
01:35:41,397 --> 01:35:45,064
God forbid if something like
that happens with our child...

1488
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:47,772
...will you still say that
she's complicating things.

1489
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:50,314
You women are your
own worse enemies.

1490
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:51,730
Like they say, Vidya...

1491
01:35:51,814 --> 01:35:53,855
Don't wait till it's too late.

1492
01:35:54,355 --> 01:35:56,689
It's a good thing that our
child took this step.

1493
01:35:56,897 --> 01:35:58,314
When Keshav shows up today...

1494
01:35:58,397 --> 01:36:00,480
...hit him hard on
my behalf as well.

1495
01:36:00,897 --> 01:36:03,480
Forget it, grandpa. I am not
even going to look at him.

1496
01:36:20,314 --> 01:36:24,442
"I crave for your glimpse..."

1497
01:36:24,522 --> 01:36:28,484
"...and finally I realized."

1498
01:36:28,564 --> 01:36:36,897
"I want to rub the mud under your feet
on my head and sanctify my sins."

1499
01:36:45,022 --> 01:36:48,984
"You didn't invite me... but I
still came down your lane."

1500
01:36:49,064 --> 01:36:55,605
"You can punish me for
all unfair treatment."

1501
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:05,564
"You didn't invite me... but I
still came down your lane."

1502
01:37:05,855 --> 01:37:09,442
"You can punish me for
all unfair treatment."

1503
01:37:09,522 --> 01:37:12,689
"Don't spare your
beloved today..."

1504
01:37:12,897 --> 01:37:14,734
"...because he never learns."

1505
01:37:14,814 --> 01:37:18,230
"Your beatings feel so sweet."

1506
01:37:18,772 --> 01:37:22,480
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1507
01:37:22,855 --> 01:37:25,064
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1508
01:37:25,147 --> 01:37:28,689
"You're the only one I love."

1509
01:37:29,064 --> 01:37:33,147
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1510
01:37:52,230 --> 01:38:01,484
"As my veil fluttered..."

1511
01:38:01,564 --> 01:38:04,734
"...you colored it
with your love."

1512
01:38:04,814 --> 01:38:09,272
"...you colored it
with your love."

1513
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:17,859
"When I look into your eyes..."

1514
01:38:17,939 --> 01:38:21,397
"...my eyes were overwhelmed."

1515
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,605
"...they were overwhelmed."

1516
01:38:25,689 --> 01:38:29,984
"My tear-filled eyes
couldn't sleep all night."

1517
01:38:30,064 --> 01:38:32,025
"They are crazy about to you."

1518
01:38:32,105 --> 01:38:34,025
"They are crazy about to you."

1519
01:38:34,105 --> 01:38:38,064
"When I heard your
sweet talks..."

1520
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:40,442
"...my heart was hooked on."

1521
01:38:40,522 --> 01:38:42,775
"My heart was hooked on.."

1522
01:38:42,855 --> 01:38:46,730
"I came to you leaving
the world behind."

1523
01:38:47,105 --> 01:38:51,189
"I severed all ties
just to be with you."

1524
01:38:54,897 --> 01:38:56,942
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1525
01:38:57,022 --> 01:38:59,359
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1526
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:03,359
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1527
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:07,355
"I've forsaken everything for you,
now punish me in any way you want."

1528
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:10,900
"We're incomplete
without each other."

1529
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:15,275
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1530
01:39:15,355 --> 01:39:19,314
"Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1531
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:24,355
"Pray to your God for me."

1532
01:39:26,939 --> 01:39:30,022
"I've let go of this shield."

1533
01:39:30,272 --> 01:39:31,859
"Color me red..."

1534
01:39:31,939 --> 01:39:35,525
"...only you can set
things right for me."

1535
01:39:35,605 --> 01:39:39,355
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1536
01:39:39,647 --> 01:39:41,730
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1537
01:39:41,814 --> 01:39:45,230
"You're the only one I love."

1538
01:39:45,689 --> 01:39:49,897
"Come dear and hit me hard."

1539
01:40:19,022 --> 01:40:21,022
This is really
humiliating, brother.

1540
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:23,980
Stop acting like some Romeo.

1541
01:40:24,314 --> 01:40:26,525
Let's go inside.. It's
your in-laws home.

1542
01:40:26,605 --> 01:40:28,022
Throw your weight around.

1543
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:30,230
How can I show my face?

1544
01:40:31,855 --> 01:40:33,314
I made a big mistake.

1545
01:40:42,772 --> 01:40:45,609
Well... you try talking
to sister-in-law.

1546
01:40:45,689 --> 01:40:47,272
I'll wait for you
in that corner.

1547
01:40:49,272 --> 01:40:51,314
And whoever hurled
that balloon at me...

1548
01:40:51,397 --> 01:40:52,900
...I'll show him when
he comes to my village.

1549
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,025
I am keeping my mouth shut because
this is my sister-in-law's home.

1550
01:40:55,105 --> 01:40:56,564
Otherwise I would've showed
you how we play Holi.

1551
01:41:45,272 --> 01:41:46,689
That won't do any good.

1552
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,272
Apply some dirt.

1553
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:50,147
Apply some dirt!

1554
01:41:50,647 --> 01:41:51,814
Apply some s*** instead.

1555
01:41:52,314 --> 01:41:54,189
You're never going to
move ahead of that.

1556
01:41:54,897 --> 01:41:56,650
You claim to have the best GK...

1557
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:59,397
...but never use
it in real life.

1558
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:01,605
Will dirt cure your wounds?

1559
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:04,939
But it will definitely
cause infection.

1560
01:42:09,272 --> 01:42:12,147
You've all made a fine mess in the
name of tradition and customs.

1561
01:42:13,064 --> 01:42:15,897
When in trouble, find
an easy way out.

1562
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:19,397
Change others, but not yourself.

1563
01:42:23,105 --> 01:42:26,314
Since the time I was born, I've
always used a toilet, Keshav.

1564
01:42:27,814 --> 01:42:29,522
Why should I change
my habit now?

1565
01:42:36,689 --> 01:42:40,855
Listen... it's really
painful, isn't it?

1566
01:42:41,730 --> 01:42:43,397
You're the one who
got beaten up.

1567
01:42:49,605 --> 01:42:52,689
But I gave you the wounds.

1568
01:42:55,314 --> 01:42:56,814
Come back home.

1569
01:42:58,022 --> 01:43:00,022
I swear I'll change everything.

1570
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:02,397
What will you change?

1571
01:43:04,314 --> 01:43:05,647
Everyone's opinion?

1572
01:43:12,314 --> 01:43:13,855
I won't die without you.

1573
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:16,730
I am happy-

1574
01:43:54,397 --> 01:43:55,855
You didn't go?

1575
01:43:56,689 --> 01:44:02,105
You see, brother never leave a patient
in hospital or a lover alone.

1576
01:44:02,355 --> 01:44:04,522
What did sister-in-law
say? Is she coming back?

1577
01:44:07,605 --> 01:44:10,939
No, Naru. And she
shouldn't either.

1578
01:44:12,314 --> 01:44:14,605
I finally realized now.

1579
01:44:15,564 --> 01:44:18,564
How can she do something she
never did all her life?

1580
01:44:31,272 --> 01:44:33,022
This isn't just about a loo...

1581
01:44:33,814 --> 01:44:35,230
It's about everyone's view.

1582
01:44:36,022 --> 01:44:40,439
Jhoni... tell me
everything. What happened?

1583
01:44:40,564 --> 01:44:44,064
What can I say, grandma...
this is getting uncomfortable?

1584
01:44:44,522 --> 01:44:48,647
They're always in the jungle before
us, with their lights and camera.

1585
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:51,355
At first, we thought
its the shooting crew.

1586
01:44:51,647 --> 01:44:54,022
But soon we realized
they were after us.

1587
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:56,189
Guess they are from
some news channel.

1588
01:44:56,605 --> 01:45:00,105
They record us like we're
indulging in foreplay.

1589
01:45:00,397 --> 01:45:03,022
It's entirely Keshav
and his wife's fault.

1590
01:45:03,189 --> 01:45:07,689
Laxmi... what did she do now?

1591
01:45:08,022 --> 01:45:11,689
Your news was published in the
newspaper and we're paying the price.

1592
01:45:12,022 --> 01:45:15,939
Jhoni, you claim to be the
leader of LOTA party...

1593
01:45:16,105 --> 01:45:18,230
...then why so embarrassed
to come on TV?

1594
01:45:18,314 --> 01:45:20,230
What are you saying, Keshav?

1595
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:23,230
- Are you drunk?
- Yes, grandma, I am drunk.

1596
01:45:23,355 --> 01:45:25,067
This is entirely
your fault, Keshav.

1597
01:45:25,147 --> 01:45:26,939
Repercussions of getting
an educated wife.

1598
01:45:27,022 --> 01:45:29,150
You should be thanking us.

1599
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:31,647
You've become a model at
this age, thanks to us.

1600
01:45:31,897 --> 01:45:33,439
Every day you defecate
out in the open.

1601
01:45:33,605 --> 01:45:35,980
So how about showing some
skin for TV as well.

1602
01:45:48,314 --> 01:45:52,564
It's alright, Panditji. He doesn't
know how to respect women.

1603
01:45:52,647 --> 01:45:56,022
The women in this country
can't respect themselves.

1604
01:45:56,397 --> 01:46:00,439
Otherwise, they would've never agreed
on defecating out in the open.

1605
01:46:07,689 --> 01:46:10,189

We'll come up with a solution.

1609

- We'll...
- No, Naru.

1610
01:46:46,939 --> 01:46:49,022
We're clone with finding
quick solutions.

1611

1613
01:47:00,897 --> 01:47:04,189
The shooting is taking place on
the border of both the villages.

1614
01:47:04,355 --> 01:47:06,730
The shooting crew
has been warned...

1615
01:47:07,022 --> 01:47:09,022
...that they should
stop wasting water.

1616
01:47:09,272 --> 01:47:11,564
The matter is under control now.

1617
01:47:13,022 --> 01:47:16,647
The next agenda, Keshav's
wife has left him.

1618
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:19,984
And Keshav has put
in a request...

1619
01:47:20,064 --> 01:47:23,022
...to build a public toilet
outside the village.

1620
01:47:23,147 --> 01:47:28,772

thumb impression on this paper.

We won't give our
thumb impression.

1623
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:40,814
Young man, did you get this
idea from the shooting crew?

1624
01:47:40,897 --> 01:47:45,939
People won't forget their values
even if you build loos for them.

1625
01:47:46,022 --> 01:47:47,939
And stop defecating
in the fields?

1626
01:47:48,022 --> 01:47:50,439
Keep this stupidity
restrained to your home.

1627
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:52,564
Stop joking, village-head.

1628

If you try to burden us
with your problems...

1630
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,397
...then, we'll have
to face the music.

1631
01:47:58,522 --> 01:48:00,314
We got freedom from
the British rule...

1632
01:48:00,397 --> 01:48:02,609
...do you want us to be
slave to their culture?

1633
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:04,064
That isn't right, village-head.

1634
01:48:04,355 --> 01:48:05,692
There are other women
in the village.

1635
01:48:05,772 --> 01:48:08,105
And their safety is the village
council's responsibility.

1636
01:48:08,397 --> 01:48:10,692
- We're happy with our LOTA party.
- Yes.

1637
01:48:10,772 --> 01:48:13,897
And what about openly
humiliating yourself.

1638
01:48:14,105 --> 01:48:16,939
Keshav, don't talk
about respect.

1639
01:48:17,022 --> 01:48:18,980
Your wife left you.

1640
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:21,150
Show some respect to others.

1641
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:24,105
That's what he wants. That
we s*** in our homes.

1642
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:25,814
Or maybe s*** in our kitchens.

1643
01:48:25,897 --> 01:48:27,817
I only want the
village council...

1644
01:48:27,897 --> 01:48:31,230
...to put in a request with
the government for a toilet.

1645

Don't try to teach us
our responsibility.

01:48:33,522 --> 01:48:34,980
This is an ancestral village.

1647
01:48:35,314 --> 01:48:37,984
Our ancestors didn't build
a toilet in our homes...

1648
01:48:38,064 --> 01:48:39,650
...and we're not Gods either.

1649
01:48:39,730 --> 01:48:42,609
If we build a bathroom in our
homes, won't that dirty our homes.

1650
01:48:42,689 --> 01:48:44,525
And what about the stink.

1651
01:48:44,605 --> 01:48:46,064
You want us to invite
diseases in our homes.

1652
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:48,859
Don't try to teach the
villagers, Keshav.

1653
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:50,980
- We don't want a bathroom.
- Of course.

1654

We don't need one, so let's
not bother the government.

1711
01:52:18,397 --> 01:52:19,817
...where do you take it out?

1712
01:52:19,897 --> 01:52:21,314
- Brother...
- Hold on.

1713
01:52:21,689 --> 01:52:25,647
Where are these... Thirty Cr
toilets. Can you show me?

1714
01:52:25,855 --> 01:52:29,772
I see... the public's awakening.

1715
01:52:30,564 --> 01:52:32,692
Well, finally after
all these years...

1716
01:52:32,772 --> 01:52:35,105
...someone came asking
for an explanation.

1717
01:52:35,564 --> 01:52:36,564
What do you want from me?

1718
01:52:36,647 --> 01:52:40,022
Toilets... which the
government promised us.

1719
01:52:40,522 --> 01:52:44,230
Actually... I am
going to expose you.

1720
01:52:44,355 --> 01:52:45,525
<i>1 see...</i>

1721
01:52:45,605 --> 01:52:49,689
See that you don't
expose yourselves.

1722
01:52:52,147 --> 01:52:54,522
Take a good look, guys.

1723
01:52:56,272 --> 01:52:59,317
This is a barber shop,
horse-stable...

1724
01:52:59,397 --> 01:53:01,147
...and this one's a tailor shop.

1725
01:53:01,272 --> 01:53:03,272
So what does that prove?

1726
01:53:03,397 --> 01:53:05,480
All these are public toilets...

1727
01:53:05,564 --> 01:53:07,772
...which you guys are using
for your personal benefits.

1728
01:53:08,022 --> 01:53:11,105
The government makes
toilet schemes...

1729
01:53:11,355 --> 01:53:13,105
...but you guys reject it.

1730
01:53:13,272 --> 01:53:15,442
And you guys don't care.
To hell with the funds.

1731
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:18,689
We won't build a
toilet in our homes.

1732
01:53:20,314 --> 01:53:23,397
Look at this Keshav, the
plan for your home.

1733
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:24,775
Few of the homes
in your village...

1734
01:53:24,855 --> 01:53:26,605
...were built under the
government rehabilitation scheme.

1735
01:53:26,730 --> 01:53:28,105
But the rest are
ancestral homes.

1736
01:53:29,105 --> 01:53:32,317
So there was never any facility
for toilets in our home.

1737
01:53:32,397 --> 01:53:35,480
The government installed
sewage lines in your homes.

1738
01:53:35,564 --> 01:53:37,439
But you guys shut it down.

1739
01:53:37,647 --> 01:53:38,897
That's not done.

1740
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:41,064
The government made
arrangements...

1741
01:53:41,272 --> 01:53:45,397
...but connecting the sewage
with your toilet is your job.

1742
01:53:46,855 --> 01:53:48,855
So who's the villain now?

1743
01:53:50,772 --> 01:53:52,897
You mean we don't
have an option now.

1744
01:53:53,022 --> 01:53:54,605
Do you know what's a PIL?

1745
01:53:54,897 --> 01:53:56,730
Public Interest Litigation.

1746
01:53:56,814 --> 01:53:57,980
Go see a lawyer.

1747
01:53:58,105 --> 01:53:59,567
Register a PIL against
the Village Council...

1748
01:53:59,647 --> 01:54:01,564
...that you want a
toilet in your village.

1749
01:54:01,814 --> 01:54:03,647
Well, finally after
all these years...

1750
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:07,689
...at least someone thought
that toilet is a problem.

1751
01:54:08,564 --> 01:54:10,609
Actually sir, until the problem
doesn't get personal...

1752
01:54:10,689 --> 01:54:13,397
...no one's prepared to
fight... or find a solution.

1753
01:54:23,522 --> 01:54:25,022
- Sir, can I come in?
- Come.

1754
01:54:48,647 --> 01:54:50,525
- Uncle, show me your face.
- Yes.

1755
01:54:50,605 --> 01:54:51,692
- Uncle.
- Taking my picture. Wait...

1756
01:54:51,772 --> 01:54:53,064
- Taking my picture. Wait...
- Uncle.

1757
01:54:53,397 --> 01:54:54,689
I took this picture at the turn.

1758
01:54:55,647 --> 01:54:57,900
This is a barber-shop,
this one is a tailor-shop.

1759
01:54:57,980 --> 01:55:00,480
This one is a cowshed, Isn't
this what the lawyer said?

1760
01:55:16,939 --> 01:55:20,147
Sir, I've brought all the
proof. What should we do next?

1761
01:55:38,605 --> 01:55:39,605
This will get the job done.

1762
01:55:40,022 --> 01:55:43,022
I'll get a sanction from the government
get a toilet built in Mandgaon.

1763
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:44,230
- Okay?
- Yes.

1764
01:55:44,814 --> 01:55:47,230
It will take 11 months.

1765
01:55:48,147 --> 01:55:50,605
Well, that's almost a year.

1766
01:55:50,689 --> 01:55:52,647
It's the government...

1767
01:55:52,939 --> 01:55:54,647
...works at its own pace.

1768
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:57,105
All these years you
lived without a toilet.

1769
01:55:57,314 --> 01:55:58,939
Another year. Right.

1770
01:56:01,189 --> 01:56:04,772
I can live without a toilet
but without my wife.

1771
01:56:08,105 --> 01:56:11,272
Remember who's the villain,
in this case, Keshav.

1772
01:56:11,772 --> 01:56:13,730
You're challenging our culture.

1773
01:56:14,564 --> 01:56:15,564
Understood!

1774
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:19,522
And it's not easy to
win over culture.

1775
01:56:19,772 --> 01:56:21,480
This is a difficult trial.

1776
01:56:22,064 --> 01:56:26,147
In this country, fighting against
culture is not an easy task.

1777
01:56:34,022 --> 01:56:36,814
Brother, I have an idea now...

1778
01:56:37,647 --> 01:56:40,109
...what this culture is
everyone's ranting about.

1779
01:56:40,189 --> 01:56:41,230
Who is it?

1780
01:56:42,189 --> 01:56:45,484
Culture is something no
one's seen or heard of...

1781
01:56:45,564 --> 01:56:47,522
...yet, everyone's
clinging on to it.

1782
01:56:48,022 --> 01:56:51,189
Culture is what makes us put donation
boxes in temples and mosques...

1783
01:56:51,314 --> 01:56:54,484
...but makes humans defecate
out in the open like animals.

1784
01:56:54,564 --> 01:56:55,772
That's culture.

1785
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:04,814
[CHANTING PRAYER]

1786
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:21,730
What is he doing?

1787
01:57:36,647 --> 01:57:38,314
This is a pandit's
home after all.

1788
01:57:38,689 --> 01:57:41,397
So veneration is a must before
starting any good deed.

1789
01:57:41,939 --> 01:57:43,064
For the sake of your happiness.

1790
01:57:43,230 --> 01:57:45,189
What good deed, son?

1791
01:57:45,272 --> 01:57:46,730
Laying the foundation
stone, grandma.

1792
01:57:47,522 --> 01:57:48,939
I'm building a
toilet in our home.

1793
01:57:49,939 --> 01:57:51,939
Now, change your
thinking, father.

1794
01:57:52,397 --> 01:57:54,230
And stop peeing out
in the gutter.

1795
01:57:57,189 --> 01:57:58,230
Okay, son.

1796
01:58:00,022 --> 01:58:01,564
You've crossed all limits.

1797
01:58:02,189 --> 01:58:03,355
Do as you please.

1798
01:58:05,189 --> 01:58:08,147
I won't eat a
morsel of food now.

1799
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:10,314
Great, no food, no stress.

1800
01:58:10,855 --> 01:58:12,022
Radhe-Radhe.

1801
01:58:14,689 --> 01:58:16,314
What... What's he...

1802
01:58:26,897 --> 01:58:28,772
"The world's preparing
to land on Mars..."

1803
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:31,522
"...while the moon's
being sold on earth."

1804
01:58:34,939 --> 01:58:36,609
"From black/white to color..."

1805
01:58:36,689 --> 01:58:38,564
"...and now everything's in 3D."

1806
01:58:38,647 --> 01:58:42,192
"Thousands have climbed...
the Everest..."

1807
01:58:42,272 --> 01:58:48,150
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1808
01:58:48,230 --> 01:58:54,022
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1809
01:58:55,147 --> 01:58:58,317
"How long are you going to keep
doing it around the bush?"

1810
01:58:58,397 --> 01:59:04,189
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1811
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:07,025
- Can I give you an idea?
- What?

1812
01:59:07,105 --> 01:59:08,564
Leave the bathroom uncovered.

1813
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:10,105
Why?

1814
01:59:10,230 --> 01:59:12,022
Are you going to bury
Anarkali in here?

1815
01:59:12,147 --> 01:59:14,064
Go on... hurry up.

1816
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:16,564
Father...

1817
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:21,272
Father, your meal..
Please eat your meal.

1818
01:59:22,605 --> 01:59:26,814
"Defecating in the open
is humiliating..."

1819
01:59:27,105 --> 01:59:30,605
"...that's what
culture tells us."

1820
01:59:30,855 --> 01:59:35,022
"Cover yourself
till your waist..."

1821
01:59:35,147 --> 01:59:38,775
"...and sit out in the open."

1822
01:59:38,855 --> 01:59:40,775
"Sister-in-law sets out
at crack of dawn..."

1823
01:59:40,855 --> 01:59:43,025
"...while the boys are
waiting on the way to ogle."

1824
01:59:43,105 --> 01:59:46,275
"Sit back and watch
what happens."

1825
01:59:46,355 --> 01:59:52,067
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1826
01:59:52,147 --> 01:59:57,855
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1827
01:59:59,105 --> 02:00:02,234
"How long are you going to
keep beating around the bush?"

1828
02:00:02,314 --> 02:00:07,980
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1829
02:00:14,772 --> 02:00:18,730
"Every lane of the country is stinking,
it's difficult to even breathe."

1830
02:00:18,814 --> 02:00:22,730
"India will be clean again look
at the condition of your home."

1831
02:00:22,814 --> 02:00:24,734
"If you sit next
to the river..."

1832
02:00:24,814 --> 02:00:26,772
"...the water will
wash it all away."

1833
02:00:26,855 --> 02:00:28,484
"And that water will flow
through the taps..."

1834
02:00:28,564 --> 02:00:30,817
"...and you'll be
forced to drink that."

1835
02:00:30,897 --> 02:00:34,734
"Stop going to defecation
in the field."

1836
02:00:34,814 --> 02:00:38,734
"Stop other people
from going too."

1837
02:00:38,814 --> 02:00:42,484
"If defecating in the open is a matter
of pride then stop wearing clothes."

1838
02:00:42,564 --> 02:00:46,734
"Not everything is a tradition,
stop hiding behind it."

1839
02:00:46,814 --> 02:00:48,692
"Stop hiding behind it."

1840
02:00:48,772 --> 02:00:51,109
"Stop hiding behind it."

1841
02:00:51,189 --> 02:00:54,192
"Don't blame culture
for your faults."

1842
02:00:54,272 --> 02:01:00,109
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1843
02:01:00,189 --> 02:01:06,022
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1844
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:10,109
"How long are you going to
keep beating around the bush?"

1845
02:01:10,189 --> 02:01:16,022
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1846
02:01:16,189 --> 02:01:21,980
"Mister... better
build a toilet now."

1847
02:02:07,230 --> 02:02:08,189
Hey...

1848
02:02:09,939 --> 02:02:10,939
Stop!

1849
02:02:27,105 --> 02:02:29,439
Keshav, stop. Stop.. Keshav.

1850
02:02:40,189 --> 02:02:40,980
Stop!

1851
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:44,859
Leave him Keshav. What
are you doing? Leave me.

1852
02:02:44,939 --> 02:02:47,064
Keshav. Leave me.

1853
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:03,189
Get lost...

1854
02:03:03,772 --> 02:03:04,939
Get lost...

1855
02:03:05,314 --> 02:03:06,439
Get lost...

1856
02:03:07,064 --> 02:03:08,022
Get lost...

1857
02:03:08,689 --> 02:03:09,817
Don't come in front of me.

1858
02:03:09,897 --> 02:03:14,522
- What happened, brother?
- Naru, the calamity's been averted.

1859
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:17,564
A Brahmin's home was saved
from getting tainted.

1860
02:03:18,355 --> 02:03:20,189
Nothing is ever going
to change here.

1861
02:03:20,564 --> 02:03:22,272
If you get hurt, apply dirt.

1862
02:03:22,689 --> 02:03:24,647
If you get a sprain, apply s***

1863
02:03:26,439 --> 02:03:28,192
If shitting and toilets
are such a bad thing...

1864
02:03:28,272 --> 02:03:29,897
...then why did God
give us a stomach?

1865
02:03:30,022 --> 02:03:31,730
No stomach, no loo.

1866
02:03:32,397 --> 02:03:36,064
Headman, open your
scriptures and tell me...

1867
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:39,359
Is it our moral obligation to make
a spectacle out of our wife...

1868
02:03:39,439 --> 02:03:41,272
...or does <i>shit</i> out in the
open give us salvation?

1869
02:03:41,605 --> 02:03:42,647
Tell me!

1870
02:03:48,314 --> 02:03:52,772
Savri... you don't feel
embarrassed having six kids.

1871
02:03:52,897 --> 02:03:55,397
But you feel embarrassed
to talk about toilets.

1872
02:03:56,439 --> 02:04:00,442
People like them associate
shame with religion.

1873
02:04:00,522 --> 02:04:01,730
You people.

1874
02:04:02,105 --> 02:04:03,564
You should be ashamed.

1875
02:04:09,105 --> 02:04:11,775
Panditji... you were
so embarrassed...

1876
02:04:11,855 --> 02:04:14,150
...to read about your
daughter-in-law in the newspaper.

1877
02:04:14,230 --> 02:04:17,105
But no shame in peeing
out in the gutter.

1878
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:20,022
It's quite obvious that
the women are fleeing.

1879
02:04:20,355 --> 02:04:23,022
We're stuck in this
blind game of religion.

1880
02:04:23,272 --> 02:04:29,897
Pretty soon... no one will ever give
you their daughter's hand again.

1881
02:04:30,105 --> 02:04:32,397
Everyone will die as bachelors.

1882
02:04:35,564 --> 02:04:36,730
Go on...

1883
02:04:37,022 --> 02:04:40,814
Go home... celebrate.

1884
02:04:41,355 --> 02:04:43,355
Tell stories to your children...

1885
02:04:44,022 --> 02:04:47,859
About how we brave-hearts
broke Keshav's Taj Mahal!

1886
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:50,480
Go on... tell them!

1887
02:05:05,522 --> 02:05:06,980
Grandma...

1888
02:05:07,772 --> 02:05:11,355
Grandma... set the
plate for your son.

1889
02:05:11,605 --> 02:05:13,647
He'll break his fast today.

1890
02:05:14,105 --> 02:05:16,022
He just broke the entire house.

1891
02:05:19,689 --> 02:05:21,397
He broke everything.

1892
02:05:28,855 --> 02:05:41,897
"I feel so unfortunate."

1893
02:05:44,355 --> 02:05:56,939
"I don't deserve you."

1894
02:05:59,730 --> 02:06:14,647
"Nothing's more..."
"complicated than love."

1895
02:06:15,689 --> 02:06:19,480
Yeah, Jaya. I tried everything.

1896
02:06:21,022 --> 02:06:23,230
We must wait for 11 months.

1897
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:24,980
No, Keshav.

1898
02:06:26,564 --> 02:06:28,480
Don't call me again.

1899
02:06:30,314 --> 02:06:33,730
And if you think I am joking,
then don't be mistaken.

1900
02:06:33,897 --> 02:06:35,064
I have an idea.

1901
02:06:44,439 --> 02:06:46,189
I'll get the Goswami Road fixed.

1902
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:48,150
I'll get it fixed from my quota.

1903
02:06:48,230 --> 02:06:49,647
Look what's published in the
newspaper, village-head.

1904
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:50,692
Calamity has befallen
on our village.

1905
02:06:50,772 --> 02:06:52,272
Divorce for a toilet.

1906
02:06:52,647 --> 02:06:54,064
Our village has been jinxed.

1907
02:06:54,439 --> 02:06:55,647
This is a complete disaster.

1908
02:06:56,897 --> 02:06:59,564
Our village will be disgraced
in the entire district.

1909
02:06:59,939 --> 02:07:02,814
Too much education
isn't good either.

1910
02:07:04,147 --> 02:07:05,522
This is really bad.

1911
02:07:06,147 --> 02:07:07,772
Brother Keshav is doomed.

1912
02:07:07,897 --> 02:07:10,772
Where can he go? He can't
stay in this village anymore.

1913
02:07:10,980 --> 02:07:13,689
There's been no divorce in our
village for the last 1700 years.

1914
02:07:13,855 --> 02:07:15,814
This is really
terrible, Panditji.

1915
02:07:16,522 --> 02:07:17,439
What can I say?

1916
02:07:18,355 --> 02:07:20,605
I never imagined I'll ever
hear this word in my life.

1917
02:07:21,564 --> 02:07:22,772
She wants a divorce.

1918
02:07:23,189 --> 02:07:24,605
Does she think it's a joke?

1919
02:07:25,189 --> 02:07:28,105
Sir, isn't he the same
Keshav who came to meet you?

1920
02:07:30,439 --> 02:07:33,480
No, he's the same 'Keshav'
who started 'Mahabharata’.

1921
02:07:33,689 --> 02:07:35,900
That 'Keshav' matter is
getting a lot of attention.

1922
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,567
We're here to
interview his wife.

1923
02:07:37,647 --> 02:07:38,980
I'll tell you once I get there.

1924
02:07:40,564 --> 02:07:42,605
Keep the bathroom
in the background.

1925
02:07:43,522 --> 02:07:45,647
This story is about Jaya
from Sabrana village...

1926
02:07:45,772 --> 02:07:49,355
...who is going to divorce her husband
just 6 months after their wedding.

1927
02:07:49,522 --> 02:07:50,897
Reason; toilet.

1928
02:07:54,355 --> 02:07:58,105
Jaya, are you actually divorcing
your husband for a toilet?

1929
02:07:59,647 --> 02:08:01,647
Don't you think this
reason is good enough?

1930
02:08:01,814 --> 02:08:04,147
You've been here since morning.
You came all the way from Delhi.

1931
02:08:04,397 --> 02:08:05,730
Did you use the bathroom?

1932
02:08:06,022 --> 02:08:08,400
Actually, we have a vanity
van, which has a...

1933
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,775
That's why you think this
is not an actual problem.

1934
02:08:10,855 --> 02:08:14,397
I advise you to stay here one
night. Go out with LOTA party.

1935
02:08:14,772 --> 02:08:16,980
Sit out in the open amongst snakes,
scorpions and other animals.

1936
02:08:17,314 --> 02:08:19,314
And then you'll
realize my problem.

1937
02:08:19,647 --> 02:08:22,772
See... she's openly describing
her deeds on television.

1938
02:08:23,522 --> 02:08:26,480
Keshav, do you think that the
government is responsible?

1939
02:08:26,772 --> 02:08:29,105
Honestly, we're to
be blamed first.

1940
02:08:29,355 --> 02:08:32,022
The scam happened because
we didn't want a toilet.

1941
02:08:32,272 --> 02:08:33,772
We love our fields.

1942
02:08:34,147 --> 02:08:37,400
And the government distributed
free notebooks to the children...

1943
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,730
...but didn't tell them
what to write in them.

1944
02:08:40,189 --> 02:08:42,647
They built toilets, but didn't
teach anyone how to use it.

1945
02:08:42,814 --> 02:08:45,522
This is the government's
responsibility as well.

1946
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:47,480
They only carried out
half of their tasks.

1947
02:08:47,730 --> 02:08:49,939
But the government has been
promoting this campaign a lot.

1948
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:53,439
And built around 6 million
toilets in the last three years.

1949
02:08:53,814 --> 02:08:55,147
They built toilets..

1950
02:08:55,314 --> 02:08:57,814
..but it's high time the government
made certain laws as well.

1951
02:08:58,147 --> 02:08:59,355
What laws?

1952
02:08:59,522 --> 02:09:01,980
Use toilets for defecating.

1953
02:09:02,647 --> 02:09:04,814
Keshav, you built a
toilet in your home.

1954
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:06,314
Who broke that?

1955
02:09:06,605 --> 02:09:10,814
The men of our country feel really
proud to do it out in the open.

1956
02:09:11,605 --> 02:09:15,147
Some narrow-minded
guy broke my toilet.

1957
02:09:16,439 --> 02:09:19,105
- So...
- Actually, it was my father.

1958
02:09:20,064 --> 02:09:22,480
So you mean to say you'll never
do it out in the open again.

1959
02:09:22,772 --> 02:09:25,689
Well, back in the days I
would stand anywhere.

1960
02:09:25,772 --> 02:09:28,564
But now I'll only stand
up for a bathroom.

1961
02:09:29,314 --> 02:09:32,109
You must have faced a lot of
humiliation for this divorce.

1962
02:09:32,189 --> 02:09:34,855
If I make a mistake, I'm
bound to get insulted.

1963
02:09:35,230 --> 02:09:36,897
There must be a
toilet in the house.

1964
02:09:37,189 --> 02:09:39,605
There must be a toilet in
the house for the women.

1965
02:09:39,814 --> 02:09:41,734
So that, men can stop them
from wandering outside.

1966
02:09:41,814 --> 02:09:44,772
Wonderful, madam. Such a twisted
question for such a simple answer.

1967
02:09:45,064 --> 02:09:47,105
Are you from foreign channel?

1968
02:09:47,564 --> 02:09:50,480
Real freedom isn't about
going out to defecate.

1969
02:09:50,564 --> 02:09:53,939
It's about going out
on your own free will.

1970
02:09:54,522 --> 02:09:56,772
But who will explain
to these idiots?

1971
02:09:57,272 --> 02:10:00,480
Our fight is against...
this. Their views.

1972
02:10:00,689 --> 02:10:01,897
Their views.

1973
02:10:02,189 --> 02:10:05,522
But if you lose this fight,
you can lose your wife too.

1974
02:10:05,730 --> 02:10:07,772
I can lose her in the
open jungle as well.

1975
02:10:08,064 --> 02:10:10,397
[would rather lose
her like this.

1976
02:10:11,105 --> 02:10:12,484
It's quite simple, madam.

1977
02:10:12,564 --> 02:10:16,189
If you want your wife, you
got to have a toilet.

1978
02:10:21,772 --> 02:10:24,355
Jaya, who do you think is
responsible for this divorce.

1979
02:10:24,564 --> 02:10:26,605
The government or our tradition.

1980
02:10:27,314 --> 02:10:31,314
The women... who'll set out
again tomorrow at dawn.

1981
02:10:36,064 --> 02:10:40,109
Jaya from Sabrana village is still
steadfast on her decision of a divorce.

1982
02:10:40,189 --> 02:10:42,772
Will this affect the government
officials in anyway?

1983
02:10:44,314 --> 02:10:46,605
There's going to be a war.

1984
02:10:52,647 --> 02:10:55,650
All our past scams will
get exposed, Yadav.

1985
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:56,897
Do you get it?

1986
02:10:58,355 --> 02:11:00,859
I guess even we'll have to
bathe out in the open now.

1987
02:11:00,939 --> 02:11:02,525
I can see stars
in daylight, sir.

1988
02:11:02,605 --> 02:11:03,564
I told you before...

1989
02:11:03,647 --> 02:11:04,730
You should've carried
out a part of the work.

1990
02:11:04,897 --> 02:11:05,980
Now the CM's called
for a meeting.

1991
02:11:06,189 --> 02:11:08,105
This is wrong, Swamiji.

1992
02:11:08,272 --> 02:11:09,567
This country will
never progress.

1993
02:11:09,647 --> 02:11:11,897
What was the result
of this movement?

1994
02:11:12,189 --> 02:11:17,397
Build toilets! Build toilets!

1995
02:11:18,230 --> 02:11:19,689
Calm down!

1996
02:11:20,939 --> 02:11:22,772
Our country is going backwards.

1997
02:11:24,605 --> 02:11:27,022
Well, there's been some
activity within the government.

1998
02:11:27,355 --> 02:11:30,147
From 11 months, its
come down to 10 months.

1999
02:11:30,522 --> 02:11:34,272
If the government functions any faster
then it will definitely collapse.

2000
02:11:45,605 --> 02:11:47,814
I'm a Brahmin too.

2001
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:52,439
I'll have water as well as tea.

2002
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:54,814
Yes, I'll get it.

2003
02:11:57,897 --> 02:11:59,272
Tell me something, Pandit.

2004
02:12:00,147 --> 02:12:02,439
Do you watch Sunny
Leone's movies?

2005
02:12:03,522 --> 02:12:05,272
Radhe-Radhe.

2006
02:12:07,564 --> 02:12:09,980
Is this what you wanted to ask?

2007
02:12:10,564 --> 02:12:13,105
You've been living alone
for so many years.

2008
02:12:14,314 --> 02:12:16,772
I'm sure you watch it secretly.

2009
02:12:18,022 --> 02:12:20,189
This was expected from you.

2010
02:12:20,439 --> 02:12:22,605
One can see your values
reflecting in your daughter.

2011
02:12:22,814 --> 02:12:24,022
That's true.

2012
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:27,814
We taught her to speak up,
instead of staying quiet.

2013
02:12:29,064 --> 02:12:32,980
Your values about entering this
house with the help of a lie.

2014
02:12:33,189 --> 02:12:37,064
The values of maligning the family honor
by giving an interview on television.

2015
02:12:37,314 --> 02:12:41,272
And complicating a simple
issue like a toilet.

2016
02:12:41,605 --> 02:12:43,400
Even you admit it's an
uncomplicated issue.

2017
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:45,564
So build a toilet at home too.

2018
02:12:46,064 --> 02:12:47,355
<i>1 see...</i>

2019
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:49,855
So you want us to
build a toilet...

2020
02:12:49,939 --> 02:12:51,359
...in the same courtyard
where we Pray to 'Tulsi'.

2021
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:53,397
Unbelievable, Panditji.

2022
02:12:54,147 --> 02:12:56,064
You Pray to the Ganga as well.

2023
02:12:56,439 --> 02:12:58,689
But don't you wash
your sins in it too?

2024
02:12:59,230 --> 02:13:00,772
You won't build a
toilet in your home...

2025
02:13:00,939 --> 02:13:02,980
...but, you've turned the
entire country into a big loo.

2026
02:13:03,064 --> 02:13:07,897
You can open your zipper, or untie
your draw-strings wherever you like.

2027
02:13:08,230 --> 02:13:10,480
Change with time.

2028
02:13:11,814 --> 02:13:12,897
Change?

2029
02:13:13,772 --> 02:13:15,355
And forget our culture.

2030
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:19,275
People like you have reduced
culture to just 'Sanskrit.'

2031
02:13:19,355 --> 02:13:22,897
Joshi... we live
for our culture...

2032
02:13:23,272 --> 02:13:26,314
...and we Pandits can
even die for our culture.

2033
02:13:27,147 --> 02:13:28,939
I know you got
Japanese degrees...

2034
02:13:29,064 --> 02:13:31,064
...but, have you ever
read the holy scriptures?

2035
02:13:31,939 --> 02:13:35,522
Lord Krishna addressed a
grave problem in Gita.

2036
02:13:35,772 --> 02:13:39,230
The world fights with each other but
only the brave fights with himself.

2037
02:13:39,689 --> 02:13:42,522
If you can conquer over
yourself, Pandit...

2038
02:13:43,064 --> 02:13:46,314
...then, you can save the children's
world from falling apart.

2039
02:13:48,772 --> 02:13:50,314
And remember...

2040
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:55,355
If you change nothing,
nothing will chance.

2041
02:13:56,064 --> 02:13:57,439
Radhe-Radhe.

2042
02:14:12,272 --> 02:14:14,480
There's nothing more
we can do, Keshav.

2043
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:19,814
We failed to rattle the government
or change father's opinion.

2044
02:14:22,230 --> 02:14:24,689
All our plans backfired.

2045
02:14:26,314 --> 02:14:28,897
Even our plans of getting
a 'divorce' failed-.

2046
02:14:36,189 --> 02:14:37,314
So what?

2047
02:14:39,647 --> 02:14:43,189
Tomorrow morning we'll go to the court
and withdraw our divorce petition.

2048
02:14:45,647 --> 02:14:47,522
We'll leave our home...

2049
02:14:47,897 --> 02:14:49,772
...and build our
own little abode.

2050
02:14:51,397 --> 02:14:53,647
I cannot break
your home, Keshav.

2051
02:14:59,022 --> 02:15:01,230
But I can break this marriage.

2052
02:15:09,397 --> 02:15:11,605
This isn't just my fight alone.

2053
02:15:14,397 --> 02:15:17,522
Every daughter, every
woman has her eyes on me.

2054
02:15:19,105 --> 02:15:20,359
If I give up now...

2055
02:15:20,439 --> 02:15:23,022
...no woman will ever fight
for her right again.

2056
02:15:28,272 --> 02:15:29,939
See... now you sound
like a leader.

2057
02:15:35,147 --> 02:15:36,147
Sorry...

2058
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:40,147
I couldn't be your wife.

2059
02:15:40,689 --> 02:15:45,689
You became my wife the day you served
father dinner after the entire fiasco...

2060
02:15:45,814 --> 02:15:47,897
...and even went
out to the fields.

2061
02:15:50,022 --> 02:15:51,692
And today... when you're
prepared to leave me...

2062
02:15:51,772 --> 02:15:53,314
...to bring a change
in this country.

2063
02:15:57,105 --> 02:16:00,730
That's more like Keshav's wife.

2064
02:16:04,064 --> 02:16:06,105
And as far as our
divorce is concerned...

2065
02:16:06,397 --> 02:16:07,522
Give me your phone.

2066
02:16:10,897 --> 02:16:12,022
Here...

2067
02:16:12,230 --> 02:16:14,230
I've deleted your number.

2068
02:16:17,605 --> 02:16:19,939
I can even walk the
gallows for you.

2069
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:22,939
Divorce is a very small step.

2070
02:16:26,189 --> 02:16:28,189
See you tomorrow at
the family court.

2071
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:30,522
Radhe-Radhe.

2072
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,897
Come on... I'll drop you home.

2073
02:16:40,855 --> 02:16:43,105
I swear I won't elope
with you. Come on.

2074
02:16:44,272 --> 02:16:52,105
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

2075
02:16:57,855 --> 02:17:03,480
"I used to feel... love's
too far-fetched for me..."

2076
02:17:03,772 --> 02:17:09,064
"...because I have no dreams."

2077
02:17:09,272 --> 02:17:14,442
"I am completely
lost in your eyes."

2078
02:17:14,522 --> 02:17:19,609
"Like sandalwood
dissolves in water."

2079
02:17:19,689 --> 02:17:27,855
"The heart's willing
to do anything."

2080
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:35,730
"Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love."

2081
02:17:40,439 --> 02:17:43,230
These days if there's an
argument the wife quits home.

2082
02:17:43,730 --> 02:17:45,647
Even if the husband's
Hrithik Roshan.

2083
02:17:46,147 --> 02:17:47,772
You're absolutely right.

2084
02:17:47,939 --> 02:17:49,689
That Joshi's daughter
didn't give up.

2085
02:17:49,939 --> 02:17:51,439
She's going to the court...

2086
02:17:51,689 --> 02:17:53,689
They might even get divorced.

2087
02:17:53,772 --> 02:17:56,419
Honestly speaking, her
husband really loved her.

2088
02:17:56,431 --> 02:17:57,317
Yes.

2089
02:17:57,397 --> 02:17:59,859
Didn't you see... he
tried his level best.

2090
02:17:59,939 --> 02:18:01,272
But to what avail?

2091
02:18:01,355 --> 02:18:03,272
Just another charade
without a reason.

2092
02:18:03,439 --> 02:18:05,314
For such small things who creates
an issue. She only made a scene.

2093
02:18:05,522 --> 02:18:08,814
Who runs away from home and demands
divorce for such trivial issues?

2094
02:18:09,147 --> 02:18:11,189
I thought her demand was valid.

2095
02:18:11,272 --> 02:18:13,147
What did she ask for?

2096
02:18:13,355 --> 02:18:15,525
Poor thing wasn't used to
going out in the open...

2097
02:18:15,605 --> 02:18:16,317
...what else could
she have done?

2098
02:18:16,397 --> 02:18:19,230
So now she can sit in
her toilet proudly.

2099
02:18:19,564 --> 02:18:20,189
And us?

2100
02:18:28,272 --> 02:18:30,814
We'll keep going
out... like we do.

2101
02:18:34,230 --> 02:18:37,980
You know... what would've happened
if we had made the same demand?

2102
02:18:38,355 --> 02:18:40,939
Don't talk to me in Jaya's tone.

2103
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:42,564
What happened?

2104
02:18:43,022 --> 02:18:44,855
She only brought
disgrace to our village.

2105
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:47,650
- Come on... serve dinner.
- I didn't cook dinner.

2106
02:18:47,730 --> 02:18:48,980
What do you mean you
didn't cook dinner?

2107
02:18:49,189 --> 02:18:51,355
If we eat, we'll have to go.

2108
02:18:51,730 --> 02:18:53,730
No food, no going out.

2109
02:18:54,022 --> 02:18:55,397
Have you lost your mind?

2110
02:18:56,355 --> 02:18:58,647
Actually, it all
makes sense now.

2111
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:37,022
- Vimu...
- Who?

2112
02:19:37,147 --> 02:19:38,605
- Oh, my...
- Mother!

2113
02:19:38,730 --> 02:19:42,230
- Oh, my...
- Mother!

2114
02:19:43,272 --> 02:19:44,439
What happened?

2115
02:19:45,355 --> 02:19:47,525
- What happened?
- I think I broke a bone.

2116
02:19:47,605 --> 02:19:49,189
But how did you fall down?

2117
02:19:49,314 --> 02:19:51,567
- Someone spilled oil here.
- Oil?

2118
02:19:51,647 --> 02:19:53,689
I was going towards the field.

2119
02:19:53,814 --> 02:19:55,730
Quickly, take me to the field.

2120
02:19:55,814 --> 02:19:58,105
Hurry up... quickly. Pick me up.

2121
02:19:59,397 --> 02:20:00,605
Mother...

2122
02:20:01,189 --> 02:20:01,959
Mother...

2123
02:20:01,971 --> 02:20:04,317
No.. I don't think I can
walk all the way to the field.

2124
02:20:04,397 --> 02:20:07,692
- And I can't control it any longer either.
- Mother..

2125
02:20:07,772 --> 02:20:10,689
- Quickly... lift me up.
- Mother..

2126
02:20:13,147 --> 02:20:15,314
Can I go in there?

2127
02:20:19,605 --> 02:20:23,355
What are you thinking?
Your mother is dying!

2128
02:20:24,647 --> 02:20:27,317
Quickly... lift me up.

2129
02:20:27,397 --> 02:20:29,355
Mother, no.. No..

2130
02:20:29,897 --> 02:20:31,859
Lift me up.

2131
02:20:31,939 --> 02:20:35,480
Lift me up. Oh, God! Oh, God!

2132
02:20:37,564 --> 02:20:38,192
Careful.

2133
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:41,230
Quickly, take me. Take me, son.

2134
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:45,605
Take me quickly. Oh, God!

2135
02:22:09,147 --> 02:22:14,025
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2136
02:22:14,105 --> 02:22:19,314
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2137
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:21,314
if Jaya Joshi gets a divorce...

2138
02:22:21,397 --> 02:22:22,942
...then, we'll all
get a divorce.

2139
02:22:23,022 --> 02:22:27,772
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2140
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:29,942
We'll fight. Take
down our request.

2141
02:22:30,022 --> 02:22:31,064
This is not the way.

2142
02:22:31,147 --> 02:22:33,192
Why don't you understand? This
is not how you get a divorce.

2143
02:22:33,272 --> 02:22:34,814
I request you, please go away.

2144
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:36,647
- We also want a divorce.
- Just go from here.

2145
02:22:36,980 --> 02:22:39,272
We've all heard about
mass marriages...

2146
02:22:39,355 --> 02:22:41,442
...but never about mass
divorce before today.

2147
02:22:41,522 --> 02:22:43,564
One reason; toilet.

2148
02:22:43,939 --> 02:22:46,397
This is a challenge
to the government.

2149
02:22:47,022 --> 02:22:48,522
- Verma.
- Yes, sir.

2150
02:22:48,772 --> 02:22:49,817
What is this?

2151
02:22:49,897 --> 02:22:52,022
Bureaucracy, sir.

2152
02:22:52,147 --> 02:22:53,900
From society welfare
committee to the village...

2153
02:22:53,980 --> 02:22:56,105
...the files have to go
through seven offices.

2154
02:22:56,272 --> 02:22:58,230
And they all have their...

2155
02:22:58,314 --> 02:22:59,355
Understood!

2156
02:22:59,647 --> 02:23:01,439
Verma, do one thing today.

2157
02:23:01,772 --> 02:23:03,105
Then buy seven locks...

2158
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:07,109
...and lock all the
toilets in those offices.

2159
02:23:07,189 --> 02:23:07,917
Sir..

2160
02:23:07,929 --> 02:23:10,147
No one will go to the
toilet for seven days.

2161
02:23:10,480 --> 02:23:12,855
Those who want to go will have
to find a solution himself.

2162
02:23:13,189 --> 02:23:14,147
But, sir..

2163
02:23:14,272 --> 02:23:18,730
Only the wounded knows the
pain, and no one else.

2164
02:23:18,855 --> 02:23:20,480
But, sir, how is that possible?

2165
02:23:20,855 --> 02:23:25,025
If our Prime Minister can ban notes
for the country's benefit...

2166
02:23:25,105 --> 02:23:28,939
...then we can
close toilets too.

2167
02:23:29,439 --> 02:23:30,439
Yes, sir.

2168
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:00,355
Jaya Joshi left her husband's
home on 15th February.

2169
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:03,147
And today they are meeting
directly in the court.

2170
02:24:03,605 --> 02:24:07,772
And the reason for their separation
is the 3000 Cr toilet scam.

2171
02:24:07,855 --> 02:24:10,105
We've never had a divorce
in the last 1700 years.

2172
02:24:10,189 --> 02:24:12,192
If Lord Krishna
returns to Radha...

2173
02:24:12,272 --> 02:24:13,939
...will Rukmini divorce Him?

2174
02:24:14,147 --> 02:24:15,775
Quarrels should be
solved at home.

2175
02:24:15,855 --> 02:24:17,942
- And not made a public spectacle.
- You're right.

2176
02:24:18,022 --> 02:24:21,605
No one's ever said that
we should use a toilet...

2177
02:24:21,772 --> 02:24:23,275
...then what is this
feud all about?

2178
02:24:23,355 --> 02:24:25,689
I wish Keshav had understood
the chapter on Manusmriti...

2179
02:24:25,772 --> 02:24:27,772
...then he wouldn't be
facing this problem.

2180
02:24:27,855 --> 02:24:30,939
Seems like people are
against building toilets.

2181
02:24:31,022 --> 02:24:33,522
They believe it's
against their culture.

2182
02:24:33,605 --> 02:24:34,730
You tell me...

2183
02:24:34,897 --> 02:24:37,314
What about the Prime Minister's
'Cleanliness Drive'?

2184
02:24:37,397 --> 02:24:40,522
If we build a toilet at home then
how can we keep our homes clean?

2185
02:24:40,730 --> 02:24:43,230
So that's their opinion about
the 'Cleanliness Drive'.

2186
02:24:43,314 --> 02:24:45,900
A village where toilets
are deemed unhygienic...

2187
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:47,855
...are bound to
have such divorces.

2188
02:24:54,397 --> 02:24:55,439
Hello.

2189
02:25:17,855 --> 02:25:19,564
Madam, sign on this urgently.

2190
02:25:23,314 --> 02:25:24,817
- Madam... madam...
- Hold on.

2191
02:25:24,897 --> 02:25:26,900
- Jaya...
- What is it?

2192
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:29,480
Will it be easy for your daughter to
live in the village after this divorce?

2193
02:25:29,647 --> 02:25:30,314
Why?

2194
02:25:30,439 --> 02:25:32,317
Is she causing
floods or doomsday?

2195
02:25:32,397 --> 02:25:33,125
No, I...

2196
02:25:33,137 --> 02:25:35,355
Did anyone in your family
ever have a divorce before?

2197
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:37,275
Forget my family, let's
talk about the country.

2198
02:25:37,355 --> 02:25:39,314
Did anyone ever have a
divorce for a toilet?

2199
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:40,817
My daughter will set an
example. Come along.

2200
02:25:40,897 --> 02:25:43,147
Do you think divorce is the
solution to this problem?

2201
02:25:43,272 --> 02:25:44,897
It is the solution
to my problems.

2202
02:25:45,272 --> 02:25:47,109
- One more question...
- That's enough... Come on, move aside.

2203
02:25:47,189 --> 02:25:49,859
Sir-sir... you tried your level
best to save your marriage.

2204
02:25:49,939 --> 02:25:51,317
But, if this is only
about a toilet then..

2205
02:25:51,397 --> 02:25:52,939
..why didn't you go
live with your wife?

2206
02:25:53,230 --> 02:25:54,605
Yes, that's a nice idea.

2207
02:25:54,855 --> 02:25:56,692
But I don't know how to
run from my problems.

2208
02:25:56,772 --> 02:25:58,234
Sir, it's not that sunny...

2209
02:25:58,314 --> 02:25:59,814
...yet you're
wearing sunglasses.

2210
02:25:59,939 --> 02:26:01,522
Are you trying to
hide your tears?

2211
02:26:01,647 --> 02:26:04,939
Look, madam, everyone's
blinded by fake pride.

2212
02:26:05,189 --> 02:26:06,730
And anyway, these
are fake Raybans.

2213
02:26:07,022 --> 02:26:08,439
But the world has a
real one on their eyes.

2214
02:26:08,564 --> 02:26:10,605
Are you going to challenge
the government after this?

2215
02:26:11,147 --> 02:26:14,647
It's your job to blame the
government for everything.

2216
02:26:15,105 --> 02:26:17,147
You should take some
responsibilities yourself.

2217
02:26:17,272 --> 02:26:19,439
Keshav, are you sad that
your wife's leaving you?

2218
02:26:19,605 --> 02:26:20,980
No, I love it.

2219
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:22,814
Now I'll get a new
wife for myself.

2220
02:26:22,939 --> 02:26:23,900
- Come on, that's enough.
- Sir, just one more question.

2221
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:25,772
- Sir.. Sir.. Please sir.
- That's enough.

2222
02:26:28,272 --> 02:26:29,522
I feel that everything
will be fine.

2223
02:26:29,605 --> 02:26:31,439
They don't know how to talk.

2224
02:26:31,522 --> 02:26:32,032
I mean...

2225
02:26:32,044 --> 02:26:33,609
These people are getting
divorced as well.

2226
02:26:33,689 --> 02:26:35,230
I don't know.

2227
02:26:35,647 --> 02:26:37,397
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Greetings. Greetings.

2228
02:26:45,772 --> 02:26:49,147
We didn't have so many
guests even at our wedding.

2229
02:26:50,564 --> 02:26:52,814
I haven't seen our
wedding video yet.

2230
02:26:53,564 --> 02:26:56,147
But our divorce is being broadcast
live on national television.

2231
02:26:59,564 --> 02:27:01,355
Fix your hair, sweetheart.

2232
02:27:04,897 --> 02:27:07,230
Quit smiling silly,
I'll fall in love.

2233
02:27:18,689 --> 02:27:20,650
Time now for a small break.

2234
02:27:20,730 --> 02:27:23,734
On the other side of the break we'll
show you Jaya and Keshav's signatures.

2235
02:27:23,814 --> 02:27:26,522
Stay with us on Abhi
Tak Channel, live.

2236
02:27:26,772 --> 02:27:29,900
After this divorce, the people are
going to divorce this government.

2237
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:32,272
Because this is their
biggest failure.

2238
02:27:32,439 --> 02:27:35,480
Judging by the size of this issue, this
was a controversy waiting to happen.

2239
02:27:35,605 --> 02:27:38,067
If what Keshav and
Jaya are doing...

2240
02:27:38,147 --> 02:27:41,105
...ushers in a change
then it's always welcome.

2241
02:27:41,230 --> 02:27:43,855
You see, I was the first one to
report this news in my newspaper.

2242
02:27:44,064 --> 02:27:46,189
But I never thought it
would escalate to divorce.

2243
02:27:46,355 --> 02:27:48,480
It's all due to the narrow-mindedness
of these ignorant.

2244
02:27:48,689 --> 02:27:50,814
But brother Keshav
tried his best.

2245
02:28:16,147 --> 02:28:18,355
Jaya and Keshav.

2246
02:28:21,564 --> 02:28:24,022
Do you two still stand
firm on your decision?

2247
02:28:28,147 --> 02:28:29,272
<i>Yes...</i>

2248
02:28:29,355 --> 02:28:32,105
No toilet, no marriage.

2249
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:48,105
Sir, this letter has arrived
from the CM's office.

2250
02:28:59,022 --> 02:29:04,522
The court rejects Jaya and
Keshav's plea for divorce.

2251
02:29:11,397 --> 02:29:14,317
The government has accepted
Keshav's request...

2252
02:29:14,397 --> 02:29:17,189
...for building a
toilet in his village.

2253
02:29:25,605 --> 02:29:30,939
The construction begins tomorrow morning
on the ground outside the village.

2254
02:29:31,147 --> 02:29:36,314
Until then... the villagers will
be facilitated with porta-loo.

2255
02:29:40,647 --> 02:29:42,317
- Why are you sulking?
- Nothing.

2256
02:29:42,397 --> 02:29:44,314
Congratulations, brother.

2257
02:29:44,522 --> 02:29:47,275
The file which went nowhere in 12
months got sanctioned in 12 minutes.

2258
02:29:47,355 --> 02:29:49,355
And do you know what the
Chief Minister did?

2259
02:29:49,480 --> 02:29:52,230
He locked all the toilets
in every government office.

2260
02:29:52,314 --> 02:29:54,439
That's when these officers
learned their lesson.

2261
02:29:54,647 --> 02:29:56,814
Remember what you said
at Mr. Mathur's office.

2262
02:29:57,064 --> 02:29:58,400
"Until the problem
doesn't get personal..."

2263
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:00,397
"...no one's willing to
fight, find a solution."

2264
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:02,105
You were absolutely
right, brother.

2265
02:30:03,772 --> 02:30:05,275
What's wrong now, Keshav.

2266
02:30:05,355 --> 02:30:07,689
We found a solution and
did the impossible.

2267
02:30:07,897 --> 02:30:09,480
We got the toilet.

2268
02:30:10,397 --> 02:30:14,314
Jaya, I promised to give
you your personal toilet.

2269
02:30:14,647 --> 02:30:15,855
I couldn't do it.

2270
02:30:16,105 --> 02:30:18,147
Maybe not personal, but at
least there's a toilet.

2271
02:30:18,314 --> 02:30:21,397
- I am happy.
- I couldn't change father's view either.

2272
02:30:22,439 --> 02:30:24,647
I can't take you
back in that house.

2273
02:30:25,064 --> 02:30:26,397
Keshav!

2274
02:30:27,355 --> 02:30:29,564
You'll always be a numbskull.

2275
02:30:30,105 --> 02:30:31,605
You fought against
the entire world...

2276
02:30:31,814 --> 02:30:35,064
...and now you say you
won't take her home.

2277
02:30:37,939 --> 02:30:40,689
Daughter-in-law, let this be.

2278
02:30:40,980 --> 02:30:44,772
The fake charades, fake
thumb, fake pride.

2279
02:30:44,897 --> 02:30:48,564
Leave all this behind and
then step inside the house.

2280
02:30:48,939 --> 02:30:50,564
- Is he sick?
- I think so.

2281
02:30:50,730 --> 02:30:52,022
I am not sick, son.

2282
02:30:52,230 --> 02:30:54,064
In fact, I am better now.

2283
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:56,189
You see...

2284
02:30:57,189 --> 02:30:59,939
It's time to take the
blind off our eyes...

2285
02:31:00,272 --> 02:31:02,564
...and put it on the toilet.

2286
02:31:03,522 --> 02:31:06,064
That's wonderful, father.

2287
02:31:06,397 --> 02:31:09,355
- That's wonderful.
- Sorry, daughter-in-law. Sorry.

2288
02:31:09,605 --> 02:31:12,647
For the first time, I've
done something good.

2289
02:31:12,772 --> 02:31:16,480
So only daughter-in-law
will inaugurate my toilet.

2290
02:31:16,564 --> 02:31:17,855
- My toilet, father?
- Yes.

2291
02:31:18,064 --> 02:31:19,772
But brother sold his
bike to pay for this..

2292
02:31:19,855 --> 02:31:21,984
- ..you didn't spend a penny.
- Get lost... shut up.

2293
02:31:22,064 --> 02:31:23,980
- Just a thought, father.
- Let it be.

2294
02:31:24,189 --> 02:31:25,484
- This isn't right.
- Quiet.

2295
02:31:25,564 --> 02:31:28,022
No.. No.. Come on.

2296
02:31:32,772 --> 02:31:34,067
- What happened?
- Sister-in-law, look here.

2297
02:31:34,147 --> 02:31:36,605
Brother Keshav... Group
photo. Yes. Yes.

2298
02:31:36,814 --> 02:31:37,772
Ready.

2299
02:32:15,022 --> 02:32:17,105
Written in scriptures.

2300
02:32:17,522 --> 02:32:23,105
Humans should not perform daily
action in front of the sun or moon.

2301
02:32:23,272 --> 02:32:26,397
Then the use of the toilet
should be made mandatory.

2302
02:32:26,772 --> 02:32:28,522
I had already told Keshav.

2303
02:32:28,605 --> 02:32:31,484
This sacrifice has to be done in the
interest of cleanliness of the people.

2304
02:32:31,564 --> 02:32:35,772
Children get used to going to
the toilet since childhood.

2305
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:37,772
If you defecation in the
open, you will beat.

2306
02:32:37,855 --> 02:32:41,150
Getting big pleasure.
My life has changed.

2307
02:32:41,230 --> 02:32:43,067
Father did not approve of this.

2308
02:32:43,147 --> 02:32:45,522
But said no. Toilets
will be definitely made.

2309
02:32:45,605 --> 02:32:46,692
Why do sister-in-law
go out to toilet.

2310
02:32:46,772 --> 02:32:49,234
Or why should any woman
go out? This is wrong.

2311
02:32:49,314 --> 02:32:51,147
Congratulations to
Keshav and Jaya.

2312
02:32:51,230 --> 02:32:53,897
Now the women of the house do not
have to go away in the open.

2313
02:32:53,980 --> 02:32:57,734
Keshav is right. 'If you want your
wife, you got to have a toilet.'

2314
02:32:57,814 --> 02:33:01,525
The money that the government
gave us to make toilets...

2315
02:33:01,605 --> 02:33:02,980
...we returned them.

2316
02:33:03,105 --> 02:33:06,689
Do we take money from the
government to buy TVs and freeze?

2317
02:33:06,772 --> 02:33:08,359
Then why take money
to make toilet.

2318
02:33:08,439 --> 02:33:10,897
The toilets will be
made by our own money.

2319
02:33:11,105 --> 02:33:12,150
Remember....

2320
02:33:12,230 --> 02:33:15,605
'If you want your wife, you
got to have a toilet.'
