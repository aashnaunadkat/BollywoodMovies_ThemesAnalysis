1
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,168
Are you 'P'?

2
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,755
-P?
-Are you Pregnant?

3
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,674
No sir, how can I be pregnant?

4
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,092
How can I be pregnant, sir?

5
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,762
Well..even if you're pregnant,
Mr. Aryan Grover..

6
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,224
..for your 'KI'.
-Kind Information.

7
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,435
The company is still not
granting maternity leave to men.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,063
-Sir..this is an emergency?
-Why?

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,773
Are you expecting a storm?

10
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,775
Tsunami?

11
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,486
Earthquake?
What is it?

12
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,907
Sir, uncle's coming.

13
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,452
He's back.

14
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:06,918
"He'll come.."

15
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,212
"This is not All India Radio."

16
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:14,009
"He'll come dressed
for the occasion."

17
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,469
"Guest in London."

18
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:22,934
"Uncle..nowadays
they are called guests."

19
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,729
"Here comes the guest."

20
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,272
"Sporting an innocent
smile on his face.."

21
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,357
"..pretending like he's a saint."

22
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,067
"But he's a disaster
waiting to happen."

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,153
"This is a serious situation."

24
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,863
"Hide under the
blanket or your bed."

25
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,740
"Coop up in your neighbors' home."

26
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,616
"You can hide in
a different country."

27
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,493
"Or trying hiding
on the Moon or Mars."

28
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,412
"Whether you hide in
the closet or your backyard."

29
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,164
"Your basement or the roof."

30
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,082
"But he will find you
he will sniff you out."

31
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,043
"He'll sc*** you openly."

32
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,461
"Guest in London."

33
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,546
"Guest in London."

34
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,298
"Guest in London."

35
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,841
"Guest in London."

36
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,718
"Here comes the guest."

37
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,101
This interview is to check
that this marriage is real.

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,396
And that you're not having
a marriage for benefits.

39
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,566
The present conversation
is to find out..

40
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,986
..whether you two are actually
uniting in holy matrimony..

41
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,323
..or faking it for
the sake of the visa.

42
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,616
No, sir.

43
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,950
We love each other.

44
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,497
Fine. We'll question you
separately about your personal life.

45
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,415
-Agreed?
-Agreed.

46
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,210
Is this an arranged marriage
or a love marriage?

47
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,962
Is it arranged or love?

48
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,798
-Love marriage.
-Love marriage.

49
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,133
The name of your
future wife's father.

50
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,094
-What?
-Your father-in-law?

51
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,595
-PK Patel.
-OK Patel.

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,097
-Huh!
-She has two fathers.

53
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,057
-What does Anaya do?
-She drives a cab.

54
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,141
I am a cab driver.

55
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,018
-How much does the lady eat?
-Not much.

56
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,520
-Does she bathe every day?
-Yes.

57
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,313
-Who sleeps first?
-Me.

58
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,023
-Who does the laundry?
-Me, of course.

59
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,566
-Who earns the most?
-Me.

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,026
-Who spends the most?
-Me.

61
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,611
-Is it all true?
-Yes.

62
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,363
This is just too much.

63
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,365
Yes, sir. We love each other.

64
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,243
Haven't met any couple that
knows so much about each other.

65
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,744
Wait, sister.

66
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,747
This is a sham.
It's a fake marriage.

67
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,666
You think so, Officer Habibi?

68
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,711
Because they know too
much about each other.

69
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,506
If any couple in India or Pakistan
know so much about each other..

70
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,800
..then, they are
not husband and wife.

71
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,510
They are Karan and Johar.

72
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,931
Officer Habibi, you Pakistanis
always have a problem with Indians.

73
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,769
Your marriage date is in 15 days.

74
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,646
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

75
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,525
Allah..now I must cross
the border to prove this.

76
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,574
So the deal is..you'll pay 7000 pounds
to Anaya for this fake marriage.

77
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,827
And she will help
you get a UK Citizenship.

78
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,829
2000 advance..
2000 after the wedding.

79
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,873
And the rest when you
submit your visa papers.

80
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,251
Anaya will stay at your house
for 6 months until the wedding.

81
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,336
And within these 6 months..

82
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,172
..you must convince the
government and everyone else..

83
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,342
..that, you two are
a very loving couple.

84
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,510
And then.. divorce.

85
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,595
And?

86
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:08,475
And during this time,
I'll have to pay for all your needs.

87
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,685
And never try to get close to me.

88
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,312
This is too much.

89
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,813
Come in. Come in.

90
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,526
This is my home.

91
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,154
This is where we're going to live.

92
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,075
This is your room.

93
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,077
Nice, isn't it?

94
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,747
Come on. Please.

95
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,624
This is the master bedroom.

96
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,917
It's got a bigger bed.

97
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,211
Enough for two.

98
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,797
One..

99
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,382
Here's your advance.

100
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,716
Count it.

101
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,135
You should always be careful
when it comes to money matters.

102
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,845
That's what I always do.

103
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,181
These are 1500 pounds.

104
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,558
I haven't received my salary yet.

105
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,810
I'll pay you the
rest as soon as I do.

106
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,937
And now..we're soon-to-be
husband and wife.

107
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,022
I know it's fake.. but
I am not going anywhere.

108
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,400
Listen, dude, cut the crap.

109
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,360
You'll have to pay me
every single penny..

110
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,821
..and if there's
a single pound less..

111
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,156
Allah..

112
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,910
-Then..
-Then?

113
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,913
-Then..
-Then?

114
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:17,210
-Aren't we future husband and wife?
-Yes.

115
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:23,633
-So..can I kiss my would-be husband?
-Yes.

116
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,343
-Yes?
-Yes..

117
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,307
Stop making that piggy face, baby.

118
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,228
That Pakistani officer
is in your backyard.

119
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,438
Look there..

120
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,860
Allah..such a long kiss.

121
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,612
-Mr. Habibi.
-You, here?

122
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,989
Allah's very benevolent..

123
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,742
..and so his disciple's
perched up on your wall.

124
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,286
And you know,
Indians and Pakistanis..

125
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,747
..have always existed
next to each other.

126
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,998
What?

127
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,168
I mean, we're neighbors
on the world map..

128
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,463
..as well in London/UK.

129
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,508
So they don't let us stay in peace
at home or out here.

130
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,345
Of course.
What did he say, lady?

131
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,596
See you tomorrow, sir.

132
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,474
Huh.. surgical?

133
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,352
No-no.. I meant tomorrow.

134
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,688
My heart's on that side..

135
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,775
..but my eyes are on this side.

136
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,527
Sham marriage, huh.

137
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,198
-No, sir..we love each other!
-We love each other!

138
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,324
Goodbye.

139
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,831
So finally you're
getting married, huh?

140
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,959
She's really hot.

141
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
Does it feel weird?

142
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,885
I didn't have a choice.

143
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,431
I've been working for almost four
years in this country on working visa.

144
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,518
As soon as my visa expires,
these Brits will send me back.

145
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,896
I want to settle
down in this country.

146
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,607
I had no choice.

147
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,317
Where are you getting married?

148
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,361
I mean..will it be at the registrar's
office, or.. -Of course not.

149
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,781
The wedding procession will arrive
at my first father PK Patel's house.

150
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,492
And I'll be sent off from
my second father OK Patel's house.

151
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,244
And both my mothers
will dance will joy.

152
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,496
Anaya.. listen.

153
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,083
I am sorry.
You know I didn't mean to hurt you.

154
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,919
Why say such things
in the first place?

155
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,380
It's just gonna be me,
him, and the two of you.

156
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,216
Parents are dead..
I can't invite my uncle Kughi.

157
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,551
So who else is going to show up?

158
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,095
Where do I get real
guests for my fake wedding?

159
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,514
Buddy, you don't know
anything about guests.

160
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,517
Guests are a peculiar breed.

161
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,022
It's like this.. Guest are like God.

162
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,983
That's why it's said..
'Guests are equivalent to God'

163
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,359
Understand.

164
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,778
"Turn around.."

165
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,659
"He looks so innocent and naive."

166
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,121
"But when the sun goes
down he shows his true color."

167
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,914
"No matter what limits he crosses.."

168
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,250
"..there's nothing you can say."

169
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,795
"And he'll make you
dance to his tunes."

170
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,672
"Doesn't matter if
he's local or from abroad."

171
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,507
"Once he arrives,
you can expect no rest."

172
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,136
"He's gonna stay
as along as he insists."

173
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,929
"You built a world of dreams."

174
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,806
"But he put up a mosquito net."

175
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,975
"You wished for a sensation.."

176
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,727
"But he ruined your chances."

177
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,228
"Guest in London."

178
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,938
"Guest in London."

179
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,899
"Guest in London."

180
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,109
"Here comes the guest."

181
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,283
"Who invited them over."

182
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,121
Aryan, some old guy stuck his
umbrella in the escalator.

183
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,581
Who could be that stupid?

184
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,085
"Here comes the guest."

185
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,920
Guddi..come on, quickly.

186
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,465
I am scared. These stairs
will start turning again.

187
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,134
No, it won't, I've stuck
my umbrella in it. Come on.

188
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,512
Sir, I am warning you,
take out the umbrella.

189
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,432
Just hold on.. what's the problem?
Come on.

190
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,604
What is this mess..
I can't do it.

191
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,147
Come on, it's absolutely safe.

192
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,567
"Come up on the roof, beloved."

193
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,445
-Sir, take the umbrella out now..
-Let it be.

194
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,781
"..on the roof."

195
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,199
He's your man?

196
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,034
But I don't know this man.

197
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,954
Well, he knows you.
He says he's your cha-cha-cha.

198
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,957
Sir, ask him to remove the umbrella
or I am calling the police.

199
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,709
-No-no, no, please.
-Now

200
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,710
Wait.

201
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:33,133
"Come up on the roof, beloved."

202
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:37,220
"Come up on the roof, beloved."

203
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,098
"Come down if you want to meet me.."

204
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,560
"..or don't show your face again."

205
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,437
Come on..come, Guddi.

206
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,521
Excuse me, uncle.

207
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,108
Kake..

208
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,945
-Kake?
-What happened?

209
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,113
-Guddi.
-Yeah.

210
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,073
Look..it's Kaka.

211
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,119
Oh my, God. He's all grown up now.

212
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,996
Last we saw him,
he was only this big.

213
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,956
-What are you staring at?
-It's your aunty.

214
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,083
-Guddi Aunty.
-Kake..

215
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,419
Guddi's grown old.

216
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,921
-Guddi aunty.
-Yes. Yes..

217
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,383
No.. who are you,
and what are you doing here?

218
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,718
Didn't you recognize me?

219
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,721
Gag.. Gangasharan Gandotra.

220
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,973
Gag.. still don't recognize me?

221
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,517
Where's the problem, son?

222
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,394
Remember Kughi uncle, from Bhatinda?

223
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,481
-Yes, Kughi uncle.
-So Kughi uncle had a neighbor.

224
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,068
-He did.
-That neighbor had a wife. Bobby.

225
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,572
Remember now? Bobby?
She was beautiful, fair complexion.

226
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,742
The neighbors used to
call her 'Malai' (Cream). Malai.

227
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,369
The laundryman lived right in front.

228
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,830
-Kartar Singh.
-Kartar Singh. Guddi remembers.

229
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,583
Kartar Singh swooped away the cream.

230
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,627
He eloped with 'Malai'.

231
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,962
-We're the paying guests.
-Yes..

232
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,131
-Kartar Singh's?
-No, Malai's..

233
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,841
We're Malai's paying guests.

234
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,053
Kughi uncle's neighbor's
paying guests?

235
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,263
Now he remembers us.

236
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:06,768
Like I said.. Indians
never forget their roots.

237
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,520
Come, son..come. Bless you, son.

238
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,438
-Bless you, son.
-Careful..

239
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,065
This is your last chance.

240
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,609
-Ask him to remove the umbrella now.
-Yeah..

241
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:18,113
Uncle.. can you please
remove the umbrella?

242
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,656
-There you go.
-See..

243
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,449
I've no plans of staying
here for the rest of the day.

244
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,784
But how am I supposed
to come up now?

245
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,328
You don't need to anymore.
We're coming down.

246
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,163
Pick up the luggage and follow me.

247
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,124
-Where?
-Home.

248
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,917
-Home?
-Yes..

249
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,752
Kughi insisted that
if we go to London..

250
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,170
..we must pay Kake a visit.

251
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,755
So here we are.

252
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,009
I am really happy. Come here..

253
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,721
So..all okay?

254
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,598
Any problems in London?

255
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,183
Not yet.

256
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,935
Okay. Come.

257
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,314
Yes, Kughi uncle. They are with me.

258
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,608
Sorry I couldn't answer your call.

259
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,071
No, after all, they are
your neighbor's tenants, so..

260
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,032
..it's my duty to take care of them.

261
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,327
-I touched their feet.
-No, son, you forgot.

262
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,329
You forgot.. go on.

263
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,710
Guddi, give him your foot.

264
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,295
You've two..so give him one.

265
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,797
Bless you, son.

266
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,424
I did now.

267
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,217
No, no problem at all.

268
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,636
It's only for a few days.

269
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,472
Yes..I'll call you back.

270
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,272
Sorry, son.
He's suffering from indigestion.

271
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,732
You..

272
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,193
I've told you a thousand times,
I can't digest horseradish anymore.

273
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,569
-So..all okay?
-Leave it..

274
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,239
Tell me, everything's okay?

275
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,922
Good Lord.

276
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,094
We're here finally.

277
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,183
Kake, it's a beautiful place.

278
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,395
-Kake, is there a bar around here?
-Bar?

279
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,854
-Yes.
-Stop it.

280
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,981
-Come inside, uncle.
-Come.

281
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,234
Kake, listen.

282
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,196
Look, son,
we don't want to be a burden on you.

283
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,448
We'll stay at a hotel if you like.

284
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,991
-Right.
-Of course.

285
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,744
We don't want to trouble you, son.

286
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,829
Yes..

287
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,832
What are you saying, uncle?

288
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,627
It's no trouble at all.
You're not strangers.

289
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,172
-This is your home too.
-Bless you, son.

290
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,551
But if you insist on staying in
a hotel then I can't stop you.

291
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,302
Who says you can't?

292
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,763
I'll slap you across
that face, you..

293
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,891
We're your uncle and aunt
after all..not some strangers.

294
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,685
You've every right to
stop us. Right, Guddi?

295
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,602
Yes.

296
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,854
Rightfully..

297
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,481
Ask us to stay and
see whether do or not.

298
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,192
Go on. Stop us.

299
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,986
-Please stay, uncle.
-We'll stay.

300
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,863
We'll stay.

301
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,156
Such a trivial thing.

302
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,908
We Punjabis have a huge heart, son.

303
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,953
Always bickering nonsense.
Come, son. We'll stay with you.

304
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,872
-We're not going anywhere.
-Come on.

305
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,793
This is your bedroom.

306
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,967
Son..the room's too small.

307
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,053
What?

308
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,306
-Even the closet's bigger.
-Yes.

309
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,350
That's how it is out here.

310
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,395
-Let it be..
-You let it be, son. I'll manage.

311
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,189
This is a woman's job.

312
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,859
-Those are unwashed.
-I'll wash them in the bathroom.

313
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,990
Such tiny rooms.

314
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,580
But really soft..

315
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,295
It's nothing..go back to sleep.

316
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,883
My back's all stiff.

317
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,430
So..all okay?

318
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,140
Aryan.

319
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,186
-Aryan?
-Where's the problem?

320
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,022
Aryan.

321
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,566
-Aryan. Aryan.
-What are you doing here?

322
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,860
-I thought you'll be coming in late.
-Not important.

323
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,655
There's a man in my bedroom,
and he just..

324
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,076
Guddi aunty.

325
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,455
-Can you explain this?
-What?

326
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,795
Your uncle's neighbor's tenants.

327
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:44,838
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

328
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,382
But what are they
doing in your house?

329
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,800
This is normal.

330
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,177
Guests and pests always
come uninvited in India.

331
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,054
But you don't even know them.

332
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,472
Listen to me..

333
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,267
I've seen them when
I was a kid.. maybe.

334
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,477
But Kughi uncle does.

335
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,980
Please, Anaya,
I cannot upset Kughi uncle.

336
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,315
You don't have to lift a finger.

337
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,569
I'll sleep in the living room
and they will sleep in my bedroom.

338
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,486
Please, Anaya.

339
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,364
They are innocent elderly people.
It's only for a couple of days..

340
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,201
Maybe do some sightseeing
around London and then leave.

341
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,495
-Where's the problem, Guddi?
-Let it be.

342
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,997
Do you really think
that girl is Kake's wife?

343
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,960
-I think there's a thief in the house.
-What?

344
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,879
Look behind you
without turning around.

345
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,672
-Without turning around?
-Yes..

346
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,008
-See?
-Yes.

347
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,136
-Call Kake.
-We don't need Kake, I am right here.

348
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,639
Allah, be kind..and
cure the doubts in my mind.

349
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,393
This silence is
speaking volumes to me.

350
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,937
Get away mister, this is personal.

351
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,857
To hell with your personal matter.

352
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,318
-Thieves..
-Thief..

353
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,528
-Don't let him go.
-How dare you steal?

354
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,030
Get lost. Get lost.

355
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,699
Careful..don't kill the idiot.

356
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,328
Why you.. Close that door.
Close that door!

357
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,789
-Right away.
-Thieves.

358
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,416
Looking to sneak in the house?

359
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,460
-Let's see you try.
-No, no..

360
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,504
-There's another door, lady.
-Close that door too.

361
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,089
-I'll close it.
-He will escape from there.

362
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,757
-You..
-This isn't fair! This isn't fair!

363
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,634
But I still have the wall.

364
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,927
You..

365
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,347
Help me, Allah!
Help me, Father!

366
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,015
Help me, mother!

367
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,477
Help! Help!

368
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,397
-My husband, what happened?
-Who is she?

369
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,067
The apple of my eye,
my cupcake..she's my wife.

370
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,820
Huh.. such a beautiful wife?

371
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,656
-Idiot wife-stealer.
-No-no-no..

372
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,157
-Uncle..
-No, uncle..

373
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,743
-Uncle..
-Uncle..No, uncle..

374
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,036
Call the cops. Call the cops.

375
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,996
No, no, don't call the cops.

376
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,748
Don't worry, we'll handle this.

377
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,334
Don't worry, we'll handle this.
You..

378
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,045
Ceasefire. Ceasefire.

379
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,175
-For God's sake have mercy.
-Why?

380
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,136
We're their neighbors.

381
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,055
-Are they your neighbors?
-Neighbors.

382
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,641
They live in the house in front.
-Our neighbors.

383
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,686
-Are you their neighbor?
-I am.

384
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,521
And you were trying to sneak in?

385
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:11,151
-Are you Pakistani?
-Allah, how do you know?

386
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,736
Your actions say everything.

387
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,654
Come on.

388
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,865
-Come inside, let's have some tea.
-No.

389
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,701
Indians first give you
a wound and then cure it.

390
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,786
-Come on. You are neighbor.
-Come on, have a tea.

391
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,747
-We're neighbors after all.
-Come on.

392
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,082
So..all okay.

393
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,918
Allah.

394
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,504
And who is this?

395
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,466
-Name?
-Haroon Habibullah.

396
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,093
We call him Harry.

397
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,387
No, Harry. Haroon.

398
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,306
Haroon's another name for Allah.

399
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,475
I'll call him Haroon.

400
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,560
Who are you two?

401
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,646
They are my uncle and aunty,
from India.

402
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,398
Uncle-Aunty..from India.

403
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,609
You must be here
to attend the wedding.

404
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,737
Whose wedding?

405
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,447
Their wedding?

406
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,576
Kake.. this isn't right.

407
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,788
Guddi..they are getting married..

408
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,624
..and we find out from
this Pakistani infiltrator.

409
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,001
So they have no clue about
your wedding plans.

410
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,002
What?

411
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,421
Did you tell them
about your wedding?

412
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,924
Why tell them.. now?

413
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,802
I mean.. we wanted to
surprise uncle and aunty.

414
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,429
Uncle-aunty..we're getting
married in 10 days.

415
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,597
Does Kughi know?

416
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,140
-No..
-Huh!

417
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,768
Yes.. but he can't be here.

418
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,603
Oh yes.. his operation.

419
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,146
What for?

420
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,482
That's okay, we're here now.

421
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,070
Such a beautiful girl.

422
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,614
Give her your blessings.

423
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,118
-I can't give her my blessings.
-Why?

424
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,620
-Ask her to wear some clothes?
-What?

425
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,372
But she is wearing clothes.

426
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,874
Ask her to dress properly, son.

427
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,794
Blessings don't work when
you're wearing such tiny clothes.

428
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,171
-What?
-Scatters.

429
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,592
Yes..
Anaya, please wear that dress once.

430
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:00,969
It's the entire set.

431
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,222
One for the blessings.
For the blessings, uncle.

432
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,265
No..

433
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,726
-You just come upstairs, I'll show you.
-We'll be right back, uncle.

434
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,896
Guddi, make some tea
for this Pakistani son.

435
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,815
Since when did I become your son?

436
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:19,279
Look, bro..India and Pakistan
are like father and son.

437
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,489
I'll make some tea
and something sweet too.

438
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,324
-You can't make tea.
-Why?

439
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,870
-We don't have any milk.
-So where's the problem?

440
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:27,954
Guddi..

441
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,664
-borrow some milk from the neighbors.
-Yes.

442
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,459
-We don't have sugar either.
-You're really unbelievable.

443
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,003
Do you have any neighbors?

444
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,006
I wear what I like.

445
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,300
And I will wear what I like.

446
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,677
Anaya.. Anaya..

447
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,473
Even I like what you wear.
And there's nothing wrong with it.

448
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,600
But they are old fashioned people..

449
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,893
..and Indian daughter-in-laws
don't dress like this..

450
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,394
..in front of their in-laws.

451
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,813
Daughter-in-law?
Daughter-in-law who?

452
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,231
Whose daughter-in-law?

453
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,068
Listen, dude, don't take
this marriage too seriously.

454
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,861
I am not taking it seriously.

455
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,905
I never even told
uncle and aunty about it.

456
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,365
It was that Habibi.

457
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,408
But this is good for us.

458
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,953
Thanks to uncle and aunty, everyone
thinks we're really getting married.

459
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,705
We'll have to put
up an act for them.

460
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,248
Act..

461
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,085
This is a bit too much.
In fact, this is over acting, Aryan.

462
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,504
Anaya, at least
wear something decent.

463
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,047
What's wrong with you?

464
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,716
We've guests downstairs.

465
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,052
Guests?

466
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,639
Uncle and aunty have
invited some people to tea.

467
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,310
The entire neighborhood.

468
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:43,154
She's looking so cute.

469
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,991
If you ever wear such tiny clothes
again uncle will leave forever.

470
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,159
-Promise?
-Huh..

471
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,870
Promise she will never
wear such small clothes again.

472
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,956
-Isn't it?
-Yeah..

473
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,376
Come on. Come. Bless you.

474
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,378
Guddi..bless her.

475
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,423
See..

476
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,009
"Water in government taps
can be unexpected.."

477
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,969
"..but her tears
are always on time."

478
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,888
Sometimes the neighbors
come along with their buckets..

479
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,515
..saying,
please don't stop crying Guddi.

480
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,058
We haven't finished
washing our clothes.

481
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,685
Be quiet.

482
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,145
-Come.
-Come, dear.

483
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,104
Come.

484
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,815
Now..take everyone's blessings.
This here is Mr. Mehta.

485
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,858
Take his blessings.

486
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,569
Hurry up, son.
Elders don't have much time.

487
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,487
-Come on.
-Bless you, son. Bless you two.

488
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,073
-And you are?
-Myself Bony Sing.

489
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,783
And this is my wife Pony Singh.

490
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,245
Take Pony and Bony's
blessings as well.

491
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,247
Take blessings from everyone
who has a pair of feet.

492
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,583
And everyone who has a pair
of hands will bless these two.

493
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,626
Quickly. Quickly.

494
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,089
Give blessings.

495
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:46,301
The wedding's after 10 days.
Everyone's invited.

496
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,720
Marriage party.

497
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,140
After 10 days..marriage celebration.

498
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,851
Come and..have a blast.

499
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,311
Snacks for everyone.

500
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,104
Wow..

501
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,815
Smells like I'm in Punjab.

502
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,859
This is pure ghee.

503
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,152
Take all you can.

504
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,154
He made it with his own two hands.

505
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,490
We're going to get
along really well.

506
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:11,910
Mr. Mehta..one needs to get into
the mood to make this long lasting.

507
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,745
-Yeah..
-That's true.

508
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,707
-Pony loves Patiyala.
-I love Bhatinda.

509
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,334
Uncle, he meant 'Patiyala' peg.

510
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,086
Bhatinda's the entire bottle.

511
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,128
Guddi.

512
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,673
Get the duty free bottle
from upstairs.

513
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,758
Kake, get some glasses
for everyone. Go on.

514
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,134
Listen, dear.

515
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:34,099
Dice some cucumbers, radish,
carrots and get them for us.

516
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,309
-Anything else?
-Some fritters as well.

517
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,144
-Fritters too.
-And some cottage cheese.

518
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:39,521
Yes..cottage cheese and fritters.

519
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,814
Aren't you forgetting
the munchies, uncle?

520
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,649
Munchies are important, you fool.

521
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,651
How can you ever enjoy
a drink without the munchies?

522
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,694
Go get some.

523
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,530
-And what do you want?
-Kashmir.

524
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,492
He's so funny.

525
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,411
Your uncle's a great guy.
Really great.

526
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,162
If you really like him so much,
you keep him.

527
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,747
He's not that great.

528
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,458
But uncle's a blessing
in disguise for you.

529
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:05,171
These days the UK Government is taking
strict actions against sham marriages.

530
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,798
Here..

531
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,010
And thanks to uncle..

532
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:14,014
..that Pakistani cop now believes that
you two are actually getting married.

533
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,934
In fact,
I think you should insist that..

534
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,228
-..they stay until your wedding.
-What?

535
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,355
You do tolerate our Boss Kaalia.

536
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,399
At least they are much better.

537
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,317
Missed me, guys.

538
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,611
-Hi!
-Here he comes.

539
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,239
-How are you doing, Louie?
-Welcome back from China, K.

540
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,241
Missed you.

541
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,411
Big T, guys. Big T.

542
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,996
Big thanks.

543
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,331
You know today is a big day for SD.

544
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,666
Soft Dogs.

545
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,168
You know why?

546
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:47,380
It's because we got
the project from China.

547
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,384
And Aryan, you..

548
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,220
You have to be ready
with the presentation.

549
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,057
Thank you so much, sir.

550
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,559
You know, if you want to be in 'L'..

551
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:03,438
..you have to be like 'K',
only then you can be a 'C'.

552
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,857
-Sir, L for?
-London.

553
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,525
-And K for?
-Kangaroo.

554
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,320
Kaalia.
And of course, C is..

555
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,364
Champion.

556
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:17,660
Congratulations A, I heard
you're getting married to a 'BIB'.

557
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,455
British-Indian Babe.

558
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,916
-Yes, sir.
-Very good.

559
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,127
It will give you a life-long stay,
in the UK.

560
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,588
The United Kingdom.

561
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,048
You're getting it.

562
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:33,301
Hello..7000 pounds
is not a small amount.

563
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,887
Sherry is right,
you need to buy the house.

564
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,516
How long do you plan
to sleep in your taxi?

565
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,274
Wow..

566
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,443
Amazing!

567
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,863
Guys, this is IPG.

568
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,740
Indian-Punjabi Gobi (curry).

569
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,412
-Did aunt make this curry?
-No, sir.

570
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,038
Uncle made this curry.

571
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,040
Too good, man. Too good.

572
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,834
Stop eating. Stop eating.

573
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,253
I want to know one thing.

574
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,673
How can any man make
such delicious curry?

575
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:12,882
-Really?
-Yeah.

576
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,259
Hold this.

577
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,643
Is he a man.. what is he?

578
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:27,355
-He's a guest.
-Very good.

579
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,233
Then make him my guest as well.

580
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,652
I would like to meet
this miraculous guest.

581
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:39,409
Boss..your guest is
going to come really handy.

582
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,453
-Kidney beans at night.
-Do you really like it?

583
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,912
Or are you eating
for the sake of it?

584
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,497
Aunty, it's absolutely delicious.

585
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,833
-Isn't it, Aryan?
-It's really nice.

586
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,544
In fact, you should learn
a few things from aunty as well.

587
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,547
I am not some Masterchef.

588
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,632
You're even better.

589
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:58,261
But then you must
stay a few more days.

590
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,221
But where are they going?

591
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:02,599
We're guests after all.
We can't stay for too long.

592
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,935
Aunty, did you really
call yourself guests?

593
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,188
Uncle, are you listening
to what aunty's saying?

594
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,481
-She's right..
-No.

595
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:12,359
If you two leave, who's going
to dance at our wedding?

596
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,485
But, dear..

597
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,613
Uncle, wouldn't you have
stayed if it was your son's wedding?

598
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:21,993
Kake..you just won our hearts.

599
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:27,165
See, water in government
taps can be unexpected..

600
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,418
..but her tears are always on time.

601
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,712
Sometimes the neighbors
come along with their buckets..

602
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:34,214
..saying, please don't
stop crying Guddi.

603
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,882
We haven't finished
washing our clothes.

604
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,467
Leave it now..

605
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:41,721
Don't worry, son. We won't leave
until you two don't settle down.

606
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,349
Well, I am done.

607
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,643
I'll see you.

608
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:50,397
Kidney beans for dinner..
You know I can't digest them.

609
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,233
You're just..

610
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:57,070
-He's not feeling well.
-It's okay, aunty.

611
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,363
It's natural.

612
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,573
Yes..gas..

613
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,617
See..

614
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,620
Even after staying in London
their values haven't changed.

615
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:09,833
Elder's fart is like
blessings for the children.

616
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,002
I'll go spread some
in the neighborhood.

617
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:28,435
I am sorry,
Anaya, that my uncle and aunt..

618
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:30,520
I hate the way you
take off your shoes.

619
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:39,863
Sorry..I'll keep that in mind.

620
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,908
I hate the way you tie your pyjamas.

621
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,289
Sorry..

622
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,041
And I hate the way you sleep.

623
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,711
You won't sleep here.

624
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,671
Then?

625
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,299
Upstairs, in the bedroom.

626
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,675
What?

627
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,260
What!

628
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,596
What will uncle and aunty think?

629
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,599
We're getting married in a couple
of days and this is how we sleep.

630
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,434
We must put up an act for them.

631
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,685
My thoughts exactly.

632
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,604
Then I thought what will you think..

633
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,315
..but then I thought
there's no point in thinking.

634
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,571
Anaya and me..in the same bedroom.

635
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:23,573
On the same bed.

636
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,412
Uncle-aunty..I love you too much.

637
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:49,307
-Uncle, you?
-Yes, me.

638
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:50,892
Where's Anaya?

639
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:54,854
She isn't here.

640
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:02,070
You see, dear,
your uncle's a bit old-fashioned.

641
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,949
The girl and boy sleeping in the
same bedroom before the wedding..

642
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,785
..makes him feel really odd.

643
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,578
I see..

644
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,249
But the girl and her aunt
sleeping in the same room is fine.

645
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,334
Of course, they can.

646
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:19,587
You know, even after
four years of our marriage..

647
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:21,756
..I used to sleep
with my mother-in-law.

648
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,758
And he would sleep with his father.

649
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,638
-That's great.
-Then..

650
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,599
So..all okay?

651
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,644
Can't sleep?

652
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,106
But I can.

653
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,649
"Kake"

654
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,071
What are you doing, aunty?

655
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:49,075
-Tying your feet with me.
-But why?

656
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:52,454
-Ouch..
-I walk in my sleep.

657
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:55,415
If I start walking in my sleep,
you can stop me.

658
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,584
It's your uncle's idea,
isn't it great.

659
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,586
Now sleep.

660
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,635
'Didn't I say..he'll come.'

661
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:14,976
'He'll come..'

662
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:25,653
'He'll come.. He'll come..'

663
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,572
'He'll come..'

664
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,532
'Didn't I say..he'll come.'

665
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,040
'He'll come..'

666
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,795
'Turn around..'

667
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,049
"He looks so innocent and naive."

668
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,967
"Like sweet porridge.

669
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:51,262
"But when the sun goes
down he shows his true color."

670
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,139
"No matter what limits he crosses.."

671
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,266
"..there's nothing you can say."

672
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,937
"And he'll make you
dance to his tunes."

673
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,689
"Doesn't matter if
he's local or from abroad."

674
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:02,607
"Once he arrives,
you can expect no rest."

675
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:06,361
"He's gonna stay
as along as he insists."

676
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,196
"You built a world of dreams."

677
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,948
"But he put up a mosquito net."

678
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,741
"You wished for a sensation.."

679
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,535
"But he ruined your chances."

680
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,620
"You built a world of dreams."

681
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,372
"But he put up a mosquito net."

682
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,582
"You wished for a sensation.."

683
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,167
"But he ruined your chances."

684
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,044
"Guest in London."

685
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,879
"Guest in London."

686
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:26,464
"Guest in London."

687
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:28,383
"Here comes the guest."

688
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,176
"Guest in London."

689
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,928
"Guest in London."

690
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:33,805
"Guest in London."

691
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,890
"Here comes the guest."

692
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,475
"No matter how hard you try.."

693
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,602
"..but there's no way out."

694
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:43,231
"His antics will make
your head's gonna scream.."

695
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:46,484
"Says my heart.. say's my mind.."

696
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:50,613
"Who invited them over."

697
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,867
"Says my heart.. say's my mind.."

698
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,578
"Who invited them over."

699
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,705
"Who invited.."

700
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,085
'Oh, Lord..'

701
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:08,506
'Oh, Lord..'

702
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:15,929
"Who invited them over."

703
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,329
I'll see you in 15 minutes..

704
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,081
Where did he come from?

705
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,250
Brother Habibi gave him to me.

706
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,877
He's sick,
and his mother's not at home.

707
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,714
You know what, just hold on to him.

708
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,256
I'll ward off the evil eye on him.

709
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:52,174
-Aunty.
-Hold him. Hold him.

710
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,009
-Come, dear. It will only take a minute.
-Aunty, please..

711
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,888
I'm really getting late,
please understand.

712
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,974
Dear..it won't take long.
Just a minute.

713
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:03,269
-What are you doing?
-Warding off any evil eye.

714
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,105
Hold his straight..properly now.

715
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:11,111
It's done, it's done..

716
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,200
Oh, God.

717
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:18,910
Oh, God.

718
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,328
-What happened?
-Oh, God.

719
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:24,457
-He just peed on me.
-No, dear. He took a crap.

720
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,543
No, he peed all over me. Look there.

721
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:29,671
No, dear.
Look at his back. He took a crap.

722
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,007
Yuck..

723
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,010
You knew he was
going to take a crap.

724
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,554
Of course. That's why
I warded off evil eye on him.

725
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:38,972
It's okay, dear.

726
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,266
Soon you'll be a mother too.

727
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,309
-What?
-Give him to me.

728
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,937
Come, my child. Come on..

729
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,148
Yuck.

730
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:53,319
In India, children are
considered as an image of God.

731
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:55,572
And their pee is like blessings.

732
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:58,742
So take it as a blessing and enjoy.

733
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:02,162
I see..you can take the blessings,
I don't want it.

734
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,498
She made that kid sh** on me.

735
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,625
He sodded over my brand new dress.

736
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,210
I am still stinking.

737
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,629
What will you do when
your kid pees on you?

738
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:14,215
Why on me? Why can't he pee on you?

739
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,051
It's the mother's job
to take care of the kids.

740
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,802
What about the father?
What's he going to do?

741
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,137
He's going to beat them up.

742
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,890
-Hey, don't you dare hit my kids.
-I will.

743
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,059
In fact, I'll strip off their clothes
first and give them a whacking.

744
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,518
Let's see you try.

745
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,103
-Take your hands off..
-Hello..

746
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,731
Where did children
come in all of this?

747
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:33,068
You two are having a fake marriage,
not a real one.

748
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,403
Who keeps inviting her?

749
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:39,032
Look Aryan,
if you two keep fighting..

750
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,867
..we'll have to actually
get you two married.

751
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,536
Only three more days to go..
hold your horses, please.

752
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:48,416
I am sorry.

753
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,003
It's okay. I am sorry too.

754
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,298
So..let's meet after 2 days
after the registrar's office.

755
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:58,885
Pammi..sounds good.

756
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:03,223
But the marriage won't take
place at the registrar's office..

757
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:07,727
..but at the 'Gurdwara'
(Sikh Temple).

758
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:11,398
That's what uncle and aunty want.

759
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,775
You and your uncle-aunty..

760
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:15,902
I swear to God, Aryan..

761
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,570
I am so sick of you.

-This is completely wrong.
-What happened, uncle?

818
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:13,098
Kake, you made a big mistake
by getting married.

819
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:14,683
Big mistake.

820
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:18,645
No-no-no..he's absolutely right.

821
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,482
Marriage is a waste
of time and money.

822
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:26,820
So true.. Give me a hug.

823
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,155
Give me a hug. Give me a hug.

824
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:34,703
Mister..are from the
bride's side or the groom?

825
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,830
He's my boss.

826
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:41,459
Boss..boss.. Boss..you're so true.

827
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:45,547
But you made a big mistake
by getting married.

828
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,632
You shouldn't have gotten married.

829
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,968
Come on.

830
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:58,143
I..did all this.

831
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,228
Looks nice?

832
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:05,108
You know, when I got married..we
didn't even have a proper bed.

833
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:06,651
Just a crib.

834
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:08,319
Do you know what's a crib?

835
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,991
-Cot.. Cot.
-Yeah..

836
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:17,662
So..it broke as
soon as he sat on it.

837
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:23,335
And we spent the entire
night on the floor, talking.

838
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:27,339
Dear..

839
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:32,719
You can think of a thousand
excuses for not staying together.

840
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:38,641
But just one for staying together.

841
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:40,727
Do you know what?

842
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,188
Love.

843
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,449
Son..stop drinking like this.

844
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:56,785
Drink like a Punjabi.

845
00:42:56,868 --> 00:42:58,370
Bottoms up.

846
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:02,791
Mr. Mehta, he means bottoms up.

847
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:04,376
Okay, okay..

848
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,294
Right, uncle.

849
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:10,465
Tonight..we're going
to drink with bottoms up.

850
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:13,259
1..2..3..

851
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:17,931
It's a big mess.

852
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:21,726
Kake made a big mistake
getting married.

853
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:25,814
I agree, uncle. I agree.

854
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:29,359
Come here, come here.

855
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:33,029
Tell me something..

856
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:36,032
Are you the tent guy
or the music band?

857
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:39,119
He's the boss.

858
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:42,539
I know who's what?

859
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:45,542
You think I am drunk.

860
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:48,336
Am I drunk?

861
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:51,089
I am drunk.

862
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:00,473
Sorry..

863
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:03,143
Uncle forced me..

864
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:06,354
I will sleep outside then.

865
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:11,943
You should've been there downstairs.

866
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:16,114
We were really having a blast..

867
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:30,295
Everything's..so nice.

868
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:36,092
Is it real? It's real.

869
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,972
It's so real.

870
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,685
Even the wedding was real.

871
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:48,271
As were you.

872
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:54,027
Your eyes..

873
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:05,163
And your..words.

874
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,584
Your lips are real and so are you.

875
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:12,087
You're completely real.

876
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:20,136
But..the truth is..

877
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:23,223
..no one knows what
the truth actually is.

878
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:30,271
Honestly..even I don't
know what's the truth.

879
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:33,400
Because there's no truth.

880
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:39,072
Except for one thing..

881
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:44,285
I really like you..

882
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,622
I honestly do.

883
00:45:49,874 --> 00:45:53,670
I wish..this relation was real.

884
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:57,841
That would've been so nice.

885
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:28,288
-Good morning, uncle.
-Good morning, Kake.

886
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:33,460
Guddi..he's awake. Make him
some tea, and breakfast for me.

887
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:35,628
Yes, right away.

888
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,507
The aroma's really nice.

889
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:41,676
Do you know what it is?

890
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,969
Aunty made sweet-porridge.

891
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,679
That definitely smells
like smell-porridge, son..

892
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:46,473
..but, I didn't make it.

893
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:52,354
Bring it.

894
00:46:57,484 --> 00:47:00,403
I don't know how to make it,
aunt taught me.

895
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,281
I apologize if it
didn't turn out good.

896
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:04,699
It's very good.

897
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:06,117
What is this?

898
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,370
You call this porridge.

899
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:12,582
It's nectar. It's nectar.

900
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,919
You really scared her.

901
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:17,921
It's really good.

902
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:19,631
Reminds me of my mom.

903
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:24,260
Come, dear. Come on. Come here.

904
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,553
Go on, dear.

905
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:35,980
-Do you need something, uncle?
-No, dear.

906
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:38,316
When the daughter-in-law
cooks something..

907
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,652
..for the first time,
without burning it.

908
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,696
It's a tradition
to give her a token.

909
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:43,655
Okay.

910
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,199
Uncle, rupees don't work here,
only Pounds.

911
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:47,534
Shut up, idiot.

912
00:47:47,617 --> 00:47:50,370
This is a token of my love.
It's accepted everywhere.

913
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,124
Come on.

914
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:00,839
Bless you.

915
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:02,424
But this is made of gold.

916
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,968
So what's Guddi
going to do with gold?

917
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:06,761
It's time for her to sleep.

918
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:08,263
Finish your porridge.

919
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,766
-I'll get some more.
-Don't finish all of it.

920
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,643
Wait, let me serve you.

921
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,531
'Now this is your
home..and your fortune.'

922
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,639
Do you know what
this bridge is called?

923
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:54,559
London Bridge.

924
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:57,854
I thought so too.

925
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:04,611
Later I found out that
this is actually Tower Bridge.

926
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:10,700
After mom and dad got
divorced dad left me with mom.

927
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,786
And married someone else.

928
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,623
Later, mom got married again too.

929
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:19,959
But she couldn't leave me
with anyone else.

930
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:22,253
So she just left me.

931
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:26,007
I was 17..

932
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:33,932
Since then..I worked
in restaurants, studied..

933
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:35,850
..drove a cab..

934
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:39,020
And then I met you.

935
00:49:41,147 --> 00:49:43,650
Marry you for the money..and
then go our separate ways.

936
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:50,615
I thought life was all about
going our own separate ways.

937
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:55,495
But after living
with you I realized..

938
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:58,248
..that life is about
staying together.

939
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:04,004
Why can't we live together forever?

940
00:50:12,512 --> 00:50:16,349
"You're the one it yearns for."

941
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:19,811
"And beats just for you."

942
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,313
"My heart.."

943
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:24,149
"My heart.."

944
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:28,069
"My heart.."

945
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:35,452
"Trying to find it's sky,
and earth in you."

946
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:39,748
"Loves you so much.."

947
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:43,668
"But doesn't know how to say."

948
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,628
"My heart.."

949
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,630
"My heart.."

950
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:51,509
"My heart.."

951
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:55,472
"O, beloved..."

952
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:59,351
"O, beloved..."

953
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:03,313
"O, beloved..."

954
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:07,525
"O, beloved..."

955
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:18,870
"Try to feel me.."

956
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:22,665
"..I dwell somewhere inside you."

957
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:30,131
"I'm where your heart beats."

958
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:37,847
"My journey begins
and ends with you."

959
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:43,103
"The moments I've
been looking for you.."

960
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:46,648
"..were always with you."

961
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:55,115
"Trying to find it's sky,
and earth in you."

962
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:59,828
"Loves you so much.."

963
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:03,790
"But doesn't know how to say."

964
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:05,583
"My heart.."

965
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,585
"My heart.."

966
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:11,256
"My heart.."

967
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:15,760
-Today is a VIP day.
-Sir..

968
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:17,512
This presentation isn't
just important for you..

969
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:18,888
..but for Soft Dogs too.

970
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:19,848
-Louie..
-Yes, sir..

971
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:22,934
I don't want any D's,
C's, or any M's.

972
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:26,771
-No disturbances, no Calls or..
-Meetings.

973
00:52:27,772 --> 00:52:28,940
Kaalia sir.

974
00:52:30,608 --> 00:52:32,277
Greetings my good man.

975
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,195
-Uncle.
-Greetings Kaalia sir.

976
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,240
-What a pleasant surprise!
-Hello..

977
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:39,617
I'm sorry, sir.
This man's unstoppable.

978
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:41,619
It's alright.

979
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:42,787
Uncle, what brings you here?

980
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:45,165
Actually, son,
I was getting bored at home.

981
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:49,336
So I thought I'll come down here
and chit-chat with Kaalia sir.

982
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,254
So..all fine?

983
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,299
-Everything's fine, uncle.
-Okay..

984
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:56,426
Guys, this is uncle.

985
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:59,846
Wonderful man.
Full of humor. Full of culture.

986
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:04,267
Tomorrow in the office party,
uncle's going to be our SG.

987
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:05,602
Our special guest.

988
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:11,232
-Uncle, you must attend the party.
-Of course, I will.

989
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,486
Kaalia sir,
you have a really nice office.

990
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:16,905
You haven't spared any expenses.

991
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,907
After all,
it's the company's office, uncle.

992
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:20,158
Which company?

993
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,243
The company we work for.

994
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:24,496
SD.. Soft Dog.

995
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:26,915
Soft Dog.

996
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,959
Only licks..and never barks.
Soft Dog.

997
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:33,505
Yes, Soft Dog.

998
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,049
Uncle, this is my team.

999
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:37,509
We design software.

1000
00:53:37,592 --> 00:53:39,219
It's a really huge time, Kaalia sir.

1001
00:53:39,302 --> 00:53:40,512
They work really hard.

1002
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:41,930
What do you do?

1003
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,723
What do you do?

1004
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:47,102
-Uncle, I am the boss..
-But what do you do?

1005
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,770
Uncle, I am the boss.

1006
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:52,357
I don't care about boss..
what's your job? Your job?

1007
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:53,441
I am the boss..

1008
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,652
We're getting
late for the presentation.

1009
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:56,569
We should go.

1010
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,448
-What happened? What happened?
-Uncle, I am in a bit of a hurry.

1011
00:54:00,573 --> 00:54:01,950
So where's the problem?

1012
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:04,369
I'm in no hurry. Go on. Go on.

1013
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:05,537
Okay.

1014
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:06,663
-Louie.
-Yeah.

1015
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:08,039
Please take care of uncle.

1016
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:10,542
-He's special, just like you.
-Okay.

1017
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:14,504
-Okay, uncle, see you.
-Yes..

1018
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:23,888
-Chinese?
-Yeah, China.

1019
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,265
Forget it..

1020
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:29,936
-So..is everything okay?
-Whore?

1021
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:32,147
-Did you call me a whore?
-Yes.

1022
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,398
You are the whore!

1023
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:36,276
First, you tell me what's up,
then me.

1024
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:37,235
I am not a whore..

1025
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:39,779
What on earth are you talking about?

1026
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:41,156
I am decent girl.

1027
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:43,908
You are too much.

1028
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:48,288
Odd..no one even offered
to get me a glass of water.

1029
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:01,009
It's not even connected.

1030
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:06,973
-I am really pissed.
-Sir, I can understand.

1031
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:08,391
What do you mean you understand?

1032
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:09,809
-This is bad work.
-Sir..

1033
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:11,770
Kaalia sir, is everything okay?

1034
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:13,438
Of course. Everything's fine.

1035
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:14,773
Drink some water.

1036
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:16,107
-Drink some water and calm down.
-Yes.

1037
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:17,817
A..you have to understand.

1038
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:19,736
The company is called Soft Dogs.

1039
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:22,238
Don't be a soft dog. Alright.

1040
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:24,282
K is L..and L is K..

1041
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:27,285
No..

1042
00:55:27,827 --> 00:55:28,912
Someone disconnect the thing.

1043
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:31,664
He's getting electrocuted.

1044
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:32,999
-Call 999.
-Call now..

1045
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:35,710
Forget 999..and use formula no. 44

1046
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,712
-Take it.
-No, no..

1047
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,464
-Take it.
-He's my boss, how can I hit him?

1048
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:41,633
Hit him or he'll die.

1049
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:49,391
Sir..

1050
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:56,731
-Boss..is everything fine?
-Yeah..

1051
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:04,447
Can someone explain what happened?

1052
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:07,742
That dispenser is broken..why
did you take water from it?

1053
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:09,828
That's why it was disconnected.

1054
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:14,666
Which fool..connected it back again?

1055
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:21,923
Which fool..

1056
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:26,136
Boss!

1057
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,730
Kake..is he dead?

1058
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:44,320
You're sleeping..and
keeping me awake too.

1059
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:48,700
I made a big mistake, Guddi.
In fact, I committed a sin.

1060
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:52,579
I almost turned that
great guy into a barbecue.

1061
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:56,624
I can't sleep until
I don't apologize to him.

1062
00:56:57,292 --> 00:57:00,545
Look..you didn't
do it intentionally.

1063
00:57:00,628 --> 00:57:03,214
But it was my mistake.
If I hadn't connected the wire..

1064
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:05,050
..then he would've never
been in such a predicament.

1065
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:06,885
No-no..I can't sleep.

1066
00:57:06,968 --> 00:57:08,762
Are you planning to
apologize at midnight?

1067
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:11,765
I will go apologize
to him at midnight!

1068
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:13,141
You've lost your mind.

1069
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:14,601
Won't it be morning again?

1070
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:16,853
Then you can go and say sorry.

1071
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:21,358
Guddi..that's more like it.

1072
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,735
You're so brilliant.

1073
00:57:23,985 --> 00:57:26,196
The boss has invited me
to his party tomorrow.

1074
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:27,447
Special Guest.

1075
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:33,119
At the party,
I'll especially say sorry to him.

1076
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:37,165
Please-please, come-come-come.
You're already late.

1077
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,458
Please, go.

1078
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,752
-Marsh, take care of the guests.
-Yes, sir.

1079
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:43,838
Mr. Kaalia. How are you?

1080
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:46,841
I heard you got electrocuted
at your office yesterday.

1081
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:50,136
Hello.

1082
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:56,393
No-no-no..some fool
connected the wire..

1083
00:57:56,476 --> 00:57:58,728
If I find him, I will not spare him.

1084
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:00,814
-Won't leave him.
-Kaalia sir. Kaalia sir.

1085
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:03,525
-Greetings, sir.
-Uncle.

1086
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:07,153
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

1087
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:09,656
-This is for you.
-Oh..thank you.

1088
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:13,493
No thank you.. In fact,
Kaalia sir, please forgive me.

1089
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:16,621
I am sorry.
I am very-very sorry, sir.

1090
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:19,124
What for, uncle?

1091
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:20,458
It's because were late.

1092
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:22,043
So uncle's apologizing
for the delay.

1093
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:23,044
That's why, uncle..

1094
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:24,921
Uncle is feeling very guilty.

1095
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,757
Amazing, uncle. Amazing.

1096
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:31,928
Ladies and Gentlemen:
this is uncle from India.

1097
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:34,305
Amazing man. Full of culture.

1098
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:37,392
In fact..he is India.

1099
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,272
All that is fine..

1100
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:45,275
It's fine, but, please forgive me.

1101
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:47,193
I am really embarrassed.

1102
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:51,906
-I am really sorry.
-Okay, uncle, okay. I forgive you.

1103
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,283
Happy?

1104
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,618
Alright. Aryan, why don't
you get some drinks for uncle?

1105
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:56,536
Please take care of him.

1106
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:58,079
I'll see you in a bit,
it's really important.

1107
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,289
But listen to me.

1108
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:01,249
-You..
-Boss has already forgiven you.

1109
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,417
Are you happy now?

1110
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:07,339
He forgave me,
but he doesn't know what for.

1111
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:11,134
-Nice dress.
-Thank you.

1112
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:15,013
Well, you can thank me
in a better way.

1113
00:59:15,096 --> 00:59:16,264
I don't understand.

1114
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:20,226
Louie, you're old
enough to understand.

1115
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,358
Uncle..do you need anything?

1116
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:28,068
Forgive me.

1117
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,529
I am sorry, boss. I am really sorry.

1118
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,490
I already have, uncle.
I've forgiven you.

1119
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:37,160
No, boss, you don't get it.
I am sorry.

1120
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:40,372
I've forgiven you, uncle.
Please go enjoy the party.

1121
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:42,040
You don't get it.

1122
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:43,917
Forgive me, I am sorry.

1123
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,878
I get it, uncle.
Please forgive me.

1124
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,840
No..you forgive me.
I can't forgive..

1125
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:53,677
Try to understand,
uncle..I am talking to Louie.

1126
00:59:57,305 --> 00:59:59,265
Louie isn't here.

1127
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:02,435
You should go too..and spare me.

1128
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:05,021
Boss.

1129
01:00:22,997 --> 01:00:25,875
He's getting on my nerves
with his apologies.

1130
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,420
That stupid Indian..

1131
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:33,216
It's natural.

1132
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:36,011
Couple of beers down,
and you've to answer nature's call.

1133
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:38,722
Keep doing it,
boss..don't try to stop it.

1134
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:39,848
Let it flow..

1135
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:42,267
If you try to stop
it..you'll get kidney stones.

1136
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:44,978
Uncle..why are you bothering me?

1137
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:47,981
-Please, just forgive me.
-No-no-no, boss.

1138
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,649
You must forgive me.

1139
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:53,987
I am really embarrassed
about yesterday.

1140
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,196
Please forgive me.

1141
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:59,951
-What should I forgive you for, uncle?
-You see..

1142
01:01:00,076 --> 01:01:03,747
Yesterday when you turned
the tap of the water machine..

1143
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,331
Uncle..
Just..just..

1144
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:07,083
-Just a minute.
-I'll do it.

1145
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:09,294
Just a minute.
Just a minute, Kaalia sir.

1146
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:15,300
Wet pants..and unbridled
youth causes embarrassment.

1147
01:01:15,383 --> 01:01:16,384
Understand.

1148
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:19,387
Oh-oh..I am so sorry.

1149
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:21,181
I am just cleaning him up.

1150
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:22,932
Enjoy yourself.

1151
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:25,977
No-no-no-no! No-no-no-no, Marsh,
that not what you think this is..

1152
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:27,062
What are you doing, Uncle?

1153
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:28,646
Marsh, listen,
this is not what you think..

1154
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,315
Boss, your pants are still wet.

1155
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:33,985
Aryan, I need to speak to you.

1156
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:35,320
Yes, boss.

1157
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:37,364
Please handle your uncle.

1158
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:40,617
He's getting on my
nerves with his sorry.

1159
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:42,494
He's after me. He will make me mad.

1160
01:01:42,577 --> 01:01:44,954
-I am very sorry, sir.
-We're very-very sorry, sir.

1161
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:47,582
No. No sorry.. No!

1162
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,293
No sorry.. yes, sorry..
I am sorry too.

1163
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:53,380
-No one's going to say sorry now. Get it.
-Yes.

1164
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:55,632
-No one. And handle your uncle.
-Yes.

1165
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:56,675
Okay.

1166
01:01:57,717 --> 01:01:58,843
I am sorry.

1167
01:01:59,844 --> 01:02:01,805
I am sorry from the
depths of my heart.

1168
01:02:02,305 --> 01:02:03,515
Really sorry.

1169
01:02:03,556 --> 01:02:05,600
-Uncle..
-I am really embarrassed.

1170
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:06,810
Uncle, what have I ever done to you?

1171
01:02:06,893 --> 01:02:09,354
-Sorry..
-Someone handle..

1172
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:11,189
-Boss..
-Uncle..

1173
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,149
-Boss..
-Where are you going?

1174
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:14,484
What is this nonsense?

1175
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:16,945
-What do you want to do?
-I made a mistake, Guddi.

1176
01:02:17,028 --> 01:02:18,238
And I must apologize.

1177
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:20,281
You haven't done anything, uncle.

1178
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:22,534
I made a big mistake, dear.

1179
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:24,744
I connected the machine's
wire in the socket.

1180
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:26,955
Not so loud uncle,
someone will hear you..

1181
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,998
-Please..
-Hi, Aryan..

1182
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:30,291
Hi, Kevin.

1183
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,585
-Meet my wife, Anaya.
-Hi.

1184
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,587
-Pleasure.
-My aunt.

1185
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:36,589
-Hello.
-Hello.

1186
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:37,924
And my uncle..

1187
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:39,676
Louie..

1188
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:41,511
Louie, listen to me.

1189
01:02:41,594 --> 01:02:44,139
-Louie.. Louie.. Louie, listen..
-K, please.

1190
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,100
-Why are you going? Come on.
-Please, I am really uncomfortable.

1191
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:48,601
Okay, kiss me. Kiss me.

1192
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:49,728
-Come on.
-Stop it. Please.

1193
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:51,479
-K, you're so drunk..
-Kiss me.

1194
01:02:51,521 --> 01:02:53,148
Please stop it.

1195
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:57,986
I am sorry.

1196
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:03,199
I told you..I've forgiven you.

1197
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:07,203
-Please get lost.
-This is not for what I did earlier.

1198
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:08,788
This is for now.

1199
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:15,128
And because what you're
doing is not right.

1200
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:18,506
It's wrong. I won't let you do it.
And so I am sorry.

1201
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:21,092
You're trying to explain me.

1202
01:03:21,843 --> 01:03:24,554
To hell with your sorry..

1203
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,894
Move. What happened?

1204
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:32,479
Are you alright?

1205
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:33,897
What happened?

1206
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:36,483
-Are you alright?
-It's nothing..

1207
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:38,777
-I slipped.
-Slipped.

1208
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,195
I slipped.

1209
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,657
Aryan..how can he just slip?

1210
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:46,910
What happened, K? All good.

1211
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:50,080
Take this old man away.

1212
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:52,665
He has no status to be here..

1213
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:54,918
..and was flirting with girls
in his drunk condition.

1214
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:56,503
Shameless, fellow..

1215
01:03:56,961 --> 01:03:59,881
Oh, God! What are you saying?

1216
01:04:00,006 --> 01:04:01,174
Ask him.

1217
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:04,803
Let's go,
I don't want to be here anymore.

1218
01:04:04,886 --> 01:04:06,680
Guddi..listen to me.
Listen to me.

1219
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:08,765
-I already heard.
-I am talking to him.

1220
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:18,858
Kaalia sir, you're great guy..

1221
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,236
..so don't be so cheap.

1222
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:23,988
Doesn't suit you.

1223
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:27,867
Just because she
works at your office..

1224
01:04:27,992 --> 01:04:29,828
..doesn't mean she's your property.

1225
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,122
You're forcing her.

1226
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:35,750
If you're man, win her over.

1227
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:40,463
But if you try to force her
it gives a bad name to our country.

1228
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:43,258
It taints her respect.

1229
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:46,469
And she's from China..
it's easier to taint her.

1230
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:49,514
Be polite..

1231
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:51,349
Don't be so rude.

1232
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:54,853
When you try to use force,
it's considered as rape.

1233
01:04:54,936 --> 01:04:58,231
And I won't let you do that.

1234
01:04:58,481 --> 01:04:59,774
Sorry.

1235
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:09,367
That's rubbish. He's lying.

1236
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:12,495
Let's go..haven't you
finished saying sorry?

1237
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:15,874
-Let's go.
-Just a minute, Guddi. One minute.

1238
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:21,504
Boss..for the last time, I am sorry.

1239
01:05:22,047 --> 01:05:25,175
And this is for what I
did earlier and not for this.

1240
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:30,305
I connected that machine
in your office.

1241
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:33,933
And I almost turned you
into a barbecued chicken.

1242
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,770
And that's why I
wanted to apologize.

1243
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:40,732
But after looking at your actions..
You're not worthy of my apologies.

1244
01:05:40,982 --> 01:05:45,278
So I take my apology back.

1245
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:46,613
Okay.

1246
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:49,616
-You...
-Relax, K!

1247
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,203
-Relax.
-Aryan..

1248
01:05:53,703 --> 01:05:57,082
-Relax.
-Aryan, move your hand.

1249
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,959
-Relax.
-You'll have to pay for this, Aryan.

1250
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,336
-Move your hand.
-Aryan.

1251
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:02,587
Aryan. He's not worth our time.

1252
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:03,505
Yes, listen to her.

1253
01:06:03,588 --> 01:06:05,298
You'll have to pay for this.
I said move your hand.

1254
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:06,633
-Let's go, Aryan.
-Move your hand!

1255
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:07,550
-Come on.
-Come on.

1256
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:08,510
Don't you get it?

1257
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:09,511
-Let's go, Aryan.
-Come, son.

1258
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:10,595
-Get lost.
-Come, son.

1259
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,682
-Get lost.
-Let's go.

1260
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:16,893
Throw them out.

1261
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:19,020
A bunch of freeloaders.

1262
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:20,522
Idiots.

1263
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:37,872
K, you can't do this to me.

1264
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:39,582
I can..

1265
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:42,085
Aryan, you're highly
underestimating me.

1266
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:45,213
Quietly sign this resignation
letter, otherwise..

1267
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:52,887
If I fire you..you can
lose your reputation as well.

1268
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:55,682
But what's my fault?

1269
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:59,436
You should've asked that
yourself last night at the party.

1270
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:01,604
When you locked horns
with me for your uncle.

1271
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,691
You know..that's the problem
with you Indians.

1272
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:07,652
Even after staying in London,
you can never adapt to it.

1273
01:07:07,736 --> 01:07:10,363
You've been working
under me for four years.

1274
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:12,490
And that old man showed up
a few days ago.

1275
01:07:13,074 --> 01:07:15,285
And you locked horns
with me for him.

1276
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:18,455
-I will make sure that old man..
-Let it go, sir.

1277
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,373
You won't achieve
anything by cursing him.

1278
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:23,376
Uncle won't stay here forever.
He'll leave in a couple of days.

1279
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:25,587
But my career will be ruined, sir.

1280
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:27,505
Please, sir.

1281
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:30,884
Fine..let's do one thing.

1282
01:07:31,384 --> 01:07:35,889
I'll tear up this
resignation letter.

1283
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:39,976
Go now..and throw that old man out.

1284
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,937
It's that simple.

1285
01:07:43,855 --> 01:07:45,648
Sir, how can I just throw him out?

1286
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,068
Why?

1287
01:07:48,276 --> 01:07:49,611
How's he related to you?

1288
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:50,737
Is he your father?

1289
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:55,742
If you want to save your job,
then throw the old man out.

1290
01:07:56,117 --> 01:08:00,455
Otherwise..I'll make sure
you're thrown out of London.

1291
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:02,082
Understand.

1292
01:08:05,877 --> 01:08:08,922
I won't let you go. No need.

1293
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:10,882
Where's the problem, Guddi?

1294
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:12,967
I'll go and fix everything.

1295
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:15,804
Look..you've already
made a big mess.

1296
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:17,097
Please don't make things any worse.

1297
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,598
Who says I'll make things worse?
Nonsense.

1298
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:20,558
-I won't let you go.
-What happened?

1299
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:23,645
He's going to Kake's office
again to apologize to that Kaalia.

1300
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:27,649
Oh, God. Uncle..last night
you said sorry so many times..

1301
01:08:27,732 --> 01:08:30,485
..that, you don't have
to say sorry to him..ever again.

1302
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:32,862
-See..
-That's why I want to say sorry.

1303
01:08:32,946 --> 01:08:34,197
I am worried about Kake.

1304
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:36,240
-Worried about Kake..
-You don't..

1305
01:08:36,448 --> 01:08:37,825
Uncle, if you're so worried
about me, can you do me a favor?

1306
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:39,869
Go on. What do you want me to do?

1307
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:41,538
Will you talk to my boss?

1308
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:43,915
Of course, I'll apologize
over the phone for now.

1309
01:08:43,997 --> 01:08:46,083
Later I'll meet him
personally and apologize.

1310
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:47,877
No, you don't have to apologize.

1311
01:08:48,336 --> 01:08:51,589
I want you to cuss him in Punjabi.

1312
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:53,883
What? Kaalia.

1313
01:08:56,344 --> 01:08:57,262
-Hello.
-Your boss.

1314
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:58,555
-Hello.
-Go on.

1315
01:09:01,015 --> 01:09:04,727
Kaalia boss..everything okay.

1316
01:09:04,769 --> 01:09:08,398
-This is uncle speaking.
-Uncle!

1317
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:11,943
I forgot to say few words
in your praise.

1318
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:15,947
-Can I say it now?
-Okay-okay-okay.

1319
01:09:16,322 --> 01:09:18,033
Just a second, uncle.

1320
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:20,076
Guys, please get up..get up.

1321
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:24,622
Today is a proud day for SD.

1322
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:28,334
The old man who insulted me
in the party yesterday.

1323
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:32,588
He wants to say a
few words in my praise.

1324
01:09:34,215 --> 01:09:35,759
I'll put him on speaker.

1325
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:41,056
Yes, uncle. Speak now.

1326
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:43,892
I thought you're a decent guy..

1327
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:46,561
..but, you turned
out to be a backstabber.

1328
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:50,190
People slogged day
and night for you..

1329
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:52,274
..but you turned
out to be a hypocrite.

1330
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,026
-What?
-I thought you'll give us respect.

1331
01:09:54,109 --> 01:09:56,279
But didn't know
you'll ruined us too.

1332
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,823
If you've any shame left,
think about the promises you made..

1333
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,909
..you stupid.

1334
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:02,786
Hey..

1335
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:05,705
You're the devil's son,
donkey's nephew.

1336
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:09,000
-The result of your parent's mistake.
-Have you lost your mind?

1337
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:14,047
Oye! lizard's egg, dog's ghost..

1338
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:19,636
-Uncle, I will kill you.
-You idiot, conniving, crafty little..

1339
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:22,472
-Shut, up!
-Bless you!

1340
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,854
What? What?

1341
01:10:31,564 --> 01:10:33,817
He quit his job.

1342
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:36,444
No, I..

1343
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:39,864
Anyway, who wants to
keep slogging in a job.

1344
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:42,617
Someday I'll start
my own software company.

1345
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:45,203
I'll do something soon.

1346
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:48,498
I'll definitely do something.

1347
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:11,271
Why quit your job if
you wanted another one?

1348
01:11:12,522 --> 01:11:13,982
I didn't quit, they fired me.

1349
01:11:14,065 --> 01:11:15,316
Are you regretting it now?

1350
01:11:16,317 --> 01:11:17,235
No, but..

1351
01:11:17,777 --> 01:11:19,779
I could've handled
the situation better.

1352
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:23,658
What uncle did was right.

1353
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:27,704
But like any typical Indian, even
I butted heads with that Kaalia.

1354
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:29,622
But that's what I love about you.

1355
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:32,667
-No, but..
-What but?

1356
01:11:32,834 --> 01:11:36,004
Would you still be saying 'but',
if someone had treated me that way?

1357
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:38,840
-I would've broken his butt..
-I see.

1358
01:11:39,215 --> 01:11:40,425
But I don't believe you.

1359
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:43,803
So don't, but what's in this coffee?

1360
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:45,388
-Viagra.
-Huh!

1361
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:50,018
Well, you don't do anything normally,
I thought maybe this might help.

1362
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:53,813
-You know what.
-What?

1363
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:56,941
-It's working.
-Really.

1364
01:12:03,656 --> 01:12:05,492
-What's she doing here?
-What..

1365
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,537
-Aunty.
-Aunty.

1366
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,289
Aunty.

1367
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:14,959
Kake..

1368
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:17,879
Listen, Kake.
Did your aunt come here?

1369
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,048
There she is.

1370
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:22,926
She was walking in her sleep again.

1371
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:24,511
Guddi.

1372
01:12:28,723 --> 01:12:29,933
Guddi.

1373
01:12:32,727 --> 01:12:34,562
She's asleep. Let her sleep.

1374
01:12:34,854 --> 01:12:38,566
I'll close the door otherwise she
will start walking in her sleep again.

1375
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:55,000
Haroon..the pride of Pakistan.

1376
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,544
Target Pakistan.

1377
01:12:58,128 --> 01:13:02,841
Soon you'll teach your father how
to sneak into your neighbor's home.

1378
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:06,636
So many clothes..

1379
01:13:06,886 --> 01:13:08,680
I don't get it.

1380
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:15,270
Brother..what's this?

1381
01:13:15,353 --> 01:13:17,939
Actually,
I brought him here for you.

1382
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:21,526
-Okay?
-His mother, my wife, she's out working.

1383
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:23,361
And you need someone
to take care of Haroon.

1384
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:26,531
-Allah, you're so smart.
-Yes..

1385
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:32,704
This is his pacifier and his bottle.

1386
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:36,416
-And..
-We do have milk.

1387
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,960
I am embarrassed.

1388
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:41,004
Haroon.

1389
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:44,674
Father's going out
to get some meat for you.

1390
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:46,885
And we'll have a feast later.

1391
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:50,221
May Allah give you salvation soon.

1392
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:54,059
Bye, Haroon.

1393
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:59,147
He's like little Lord Krishna.
Just his complexions bit off.

1394
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:02,525
It's alright.
I'll make you fair today.

1395
01:14:02,817 --> 01:14:07,614
First, I'll massage you
properly with oil. And then..

1396
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:09,783
Oh, my child.

1397
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:12,744
Did anyone give Haroon
massage like this?

1398
01:14:12,994 --> 01:14:17,791
I wish your mother had
and bathed you properly.

1399
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:21,252
Then even you would've looked
pretty like these foreigners.

1400
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:26,257
I'll bathe you with cream. Isn't it?

1401
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:27,967
See..

1402
01:14:28,051 --> 01:14:29,302
See..

1403
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:31,429
Oh my, God. What is she doing?

1404
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:35,058
Come on..
Hello, 999..

1405
01:14:35,308 --> 01:14:37,519
Please, there's a
lady outside my house..

1406
01:14:37,602 --> 01:14:38,937
..and she's killing this baby.

1407
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,980
She must be a baby killer.

1408
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:48,530
-See..
-Oh my, God.

1409
01:14:48,613 --> 01:14:50,281
-Haroon's getting a massage.
-Oh my, God.

1410
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:52,867
-Stop it.
-Put the baby down.

1411
01:14:52,951 --> 01:14:55,495
-Stop it. Stop it.
-Why? What happened?

1412
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,080
Freeze.

1413
01:14:57,163 --> 01:14:58,790
Stop..put the baby down.

1414
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:00,250
Stand back. Stand back.

1415
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:01,626
Give me the baby.

1416
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:03,503
I still have to massage him.

1417
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:07,090
Later I'll bathe him with cream.
Isn't it, Haroon?

1418
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:08,466
Give me the baby.

1419
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,802
How can I give you someone's baby?

1420
01:15:10,885 --> 01:15:12,387
Don't you have your own kids?

1421
01:15:12,512 --> 01:15:14,889
-Can you speak English?
-English?

1422
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:16,599
Yes-yes-yes..

1423
01:15:16,933 --> 01:15:20,145
Good morning..good evening..

1424
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:22,272
Bye..

1425
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:24,816
Okay, tata..

1426
01:15:25,191 --> 01:15:27,819
-Stand back. Stand back.
-What happened?

1427
01:15:27,902 --> 01:15:29,487
Give me the baby
or I will shoot you.

1428
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:33,074
Oh, God. He'll shoot me.

1429
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:35,410
-Come on, Haroon.
-Don't try to hide.

1430
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:37,412
You're surrounded
by Metropolitan Police.

1431
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,456
-But what have I done?
-What is happening?

1432
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:40,874
Give me the baby now.

1433
01:15:40,957 --> 01:15:42,375
-Baby killer.
-Baby killer.

1434
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:44,669
-She is trying to kill your baby.
-My baby.

1435
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:47,380
Aunty, they are saying
that you will kill her baby.

1436
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:49,924
-Kill, me..
-Get back. Get back.

1437
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,843
Give me the baby or I will shoot.

1438
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,597
Shoot this woman, please.

1439
01:15:56,723 --> 01:15:57,974
Give me my baby.

1440
01:15:58,058 --> 01:15:59,267
-What happened?
-Give me my baby, please.

1441
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:01,269
What happened?
Did West Indies lose a match again?

1442
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:02,645
-Brother..
-Haroon.

1443
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:06,524
-Please explain them.
-Yes..I give it to her.

1444
01:16:06,608 --> 01:16:08,109
-You gave her the baby.
-Yes.

1445
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:11,946
I will kill you.
I will kill you. I will kill you.

1446
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,198
-I will kill you.
-Stop it.

1447
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:15,367
-I will shoot you.
-Hey, it's okay.

1448
01:16:16,326 --> 01:16:17,702
Kake..

1449
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:21,081
-Give me the baby or I will shoot you.
-No-no-no..

1450
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:22,916
Officer, wait.

1451
01:16:23,124 --> 01:16:25,919
Stop-stop, don't shoot.
What happened?

1452
01:16:26,002 --> 01:16:28,213
She's a baby killer,
she's been trying to kill her baby.

1453
01:16:28,296 --> 01:16:29,547
-Yes..
-No-no-no.

1454
01:16:29,714 --> 01:16:31,424
Aunty, what are they saying?

1455
01:16:31,549 --> 01:16:35,261
Dear, I was only giving him
a massage because he was crying.

1456
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:36,554
-Aunty..
-He was crying.

1457
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,640
Hold on..first give me the baby.

1458
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:40,433
It's very cold. It's cold.

1459
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:43,019
Here's your baby.
Alright. Alright.

1460
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:43,978
The baby's with her.

1461
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:45,146
No baby.

1462
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:47,565
One second. Officer, one second.

1463
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:49,776
One second. I think there's
some sort of confusion.

1464
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,070
She was only giving
the baby a massage.

1465
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:54,155
That was an Indian style massage.

1466
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,033
A massage? Holding the baby like this?

1467
01:16:57,909 --> 01:16:59,244
What does like this mean?

1468
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:03,206
Dear..it's good for breathing.

1469
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:08,586
She was doing that because
it helps the baby breathe.

1470
01:17:08,753 --> 01:17:09,963
And digest.

1471
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,757
It's just an Indian style massage.

1472
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:14,009
You gotta be kidding me.

1473
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:15,552
-Sorry.
-I don't believe it.

1474
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:18,138
-I am sorry.
-Massager.

1475
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:19,723
-Sorry..
-You!

1476
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:22,600
See..see, brother.
He's sleeping so soundly.

1477
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:23,601
Yes, exactly.

1478
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:26,521
-I'll massage him every day.
-No!

1479
01:17:26,938 --> 01:17:29,733
No more massages. Let's go home,
and you go to your home.

1480
01:17:29,941 --> 01:17:31,067
You go, we come.

1481
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:33,028
Okay.

1482
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:34,988
Crazy.

1483
01:17:35,071 --> 01:17:39,534
Relax..aunt only gave him a massage,
not murder the baby.

1484
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:40,577
It was murder..

1485
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,704
Who massages the baby like that?

1486
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:44,247
That woman could've sued us.

1487
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:47,083
That's how children
are massaged in Punjab.

1488
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,169
And children grow up to be strong.

1489
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:51,838
In fact, you should let
aunty massage your kids too.

1490
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:55,258
Are they going to stay
here until we have kids?

1491
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:57,052
Seems like that.

1492
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:02,474
You know what,
did you see my trimmer.

1493
01:18:02,557 --> 01:18:03,892
I have to shave.

1494
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,353
You're worried about your
trimmer and I can't find my jeans.

1495
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:09,481
I wonder where's my trimmer..

1496
01:18:12,275 --> 01:18:13,818
Uncle, what are you
doing with my trimmer?

1497
01:18:13,943 --> 01:18:15,070
Cleaning my armpits.

1498
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:17,030
But it's for shaving.

1499
01:18:17,113 --> 01:18:18,573
So I am shaving my underarms.

1500
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:21,534
There we go.. I am done.

1501
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:22,660
You do it.

1502
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:24,662
What will I do with this now?

1503
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:26,373
Why? Get a shave..like me.

1504
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:29,918
No. Uncle..do you like it?

1505
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,961
-Yes..
-Keep it.

1506
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:33,588
You want me to keep it.

1507
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:37,342
-Guddi.
-Yes.

1508
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:38,426
See Guddi..

1509
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:41,596
Kake just gave me an imported gift.

1510
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,474
-See..
-Wow, son, thank you.

1511
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,519
-Son, here are the clothes?
-Clothes?

1512
01:18:47,894 --> 01:18:50,772
Daughter-in-law's jeans were torn.
So I stitched it up.

1513
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:53,233
-Stitched it?
-Yes, dear.

1514
01:18:53,608 --> 01:18:54,943
She will be really happy.

1515
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:59,155
See..she's jumping with joy.

1516
01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:04,035
Happy birthday to you.

1517
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:07,205
Happy birthday Mehta uncle.

1518
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,416
-Forget the cake..
-You eat first..

1519
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:10,917
..have these sweets instead

1520
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,544
Have sweets.

1521
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:13,753
Have sweets. Here..

1522
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:16,756
Smells like I am in Punjab. Wow.

1523
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,634
It's not the fragrance of Punjab.

1524
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:22,470
Uncle's silently farting.

1525
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:23,680
What?

1526
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:27,642
Sorry..he's got indigestion.

1527
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:31,563
No need to say sorry. He only
farted, not like he set-off a bomb.

1528
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:35,859
See Guddi, we've inherited
farting from our elders.

1529
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:37,152
Forget it..

1530
01:19:37,235 --> 01:19:40,030
Don't feel ashamed if you farted.

1531
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:43,116
Only the one's who
are alive are farting.

1532
01:19:43,324 --> 01:19:45,577
Wow.. that's unbelievable.

1533
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:47,746
Mr. Mehta,
I've written a few lines on fart.

1534
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:49,539
That's amazing..so
what are you waiting for?

1535
01:19:49,622 --> 01:19:53,251
Not like this. Such gatherings are
pointless without alcohol.

1536
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:56,129
Uncle, you're absolutely right.

1537
01:19:56,212 --> 01:19:58,006
-We all need a drink.
-Yeah..

1538
01:19:58,089 --> 01:20:00,383
-Guddi.
-Yeah.

1539
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:02,260
Get the duty-free bottle.

1540
01:20:02,385 --> 01:20:03,553
And Kake..

1541
01:20:03,636 --> 01:20:06,639
I'll get some cucumbers,
tomatoes, and carrots for you.

1542
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:09,225
Cottage cheese..
Fritters and munchies.

1543
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:10,727
I'll get everything, uncle.

1544
01:20:10,852 --> 01:20:12,937
Who will get the glasses, you fool?

1545
01:20:14,272 --> 01:20:16,691
What? Who am I? Am I the maid?

1546
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:18,651
Daughter-in-law..slice some carrots.

1547
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:20,195
Daughter-in-law..slice some radish.

1548
01:20:20,278 --> 01:20:21,446
I would slice them instead.

1549
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:22,781
Get some fritters.

1550
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:26,117
Can we get some cottage cheese?
How about some munchies?

1551
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:27,994
I hate this
daughter-in-law and Kake.

1552
01:20:28,244 --> 01:20:31,331
In Punjab,
sons are addressed as Kake..

1553
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:33,875
..and his wife as daughter-in-law.

1554
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,669
I am not their daughter-in-law.

1555
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:37,629
-Daughter-in-law.
-Coming.

1556
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:49,349
"Sometimes it's loud,
and sometimes it's without a sound."

1557
01:20:49,432 --> 01:20:51,059
Wow!

1558
01:20:51,184 --> 01:20:54,979
"Sometimes it's loud,
and sometimes it's without a sound."

1559
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:59,109
"Every fart has
its own unique style."

1560
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:00,485
'Allah!'

1561
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:04,280
"Sometimes it's like a breeze
and sometimes like a blast."

1562
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:05,824
"Sometimes it's
behind closed doors.."

1563
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:07,784
"..and sometimes it
happens out in the open."

1564
01:21:07,867 --> 01:21:10,120
It does..it does..
It often happens like that.

1565
01:21:10,203 --> 01:21:13,331
"Sometimes silent..sometimes violent."

1566
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:19,379
"When a stunning lady farts,
it smells like roses."

1567
01:21:19,462 --> 01:21:22,090
-This one's for you, dear.
-For me?

1568
01:21:22,215 --> 01:21:25,969
"When a stunning lady farts,
it smells like roses."

1569
01:21:26,052 --> 01:21:30,015
"My fart makes people comatose."

1570
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:32,642
"When you fart, it smells rose."

1571
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:36,938
"When she farts..brain close."

1572
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:40,400
"It isn't just me..the
entire world's farting."

1573
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:43,486
"It isn't just me..the
entire world's farting."

1574
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:46,948
"People have always
been free to fart."

1575
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:50,577
"Pappu's farting..and so is Tommy."

1576
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:54,372
"Somewhere entire sect's farting while
somewhere a commie's farting too."

1577
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:05,759
"There's no tax on fart,
everyone's farting tax-free."

1578
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:09,596
"Somewhere an entire
nation farting."

1579
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:16,269
"America farted on Iraq,
and Osama farted back on America."

1580
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:21,399
"And ruined many
homes and families."

1581
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:25,403
"And Pakistan keeps
farting all the time."

1582
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:28,990
"Keeps secretly
farting all the time."

1583
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:34,996
"Everyone else' grief's come later,
because our own people fart the most."

1584
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:39,084
"When stars fart,
it gets retweeted."

1585
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:43,338
-"They even get likes.
-They even get likes."

1586
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:46,841
"Politicians get a mike to fart."

1587
01:22:46,925 --> 01:22:50,762
"They get a mike. They get a mike."

1588
01:22:50,845 --> 01:22:54,432
"My fart only burns
the hair in your noses.."

1589
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:57,644
"..but their fart pierces
right through your soul."

1590
01:22:57,727 --> 01:22:59,312
'Allah.'

1591
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:02,649
"Fart has.."

1592
01:23:03,316 --> 01:23:06,319
"Fart has blown away
the fragrance in relations."

1593
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:07,696
Amazing.

1594
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:11,533
"Fart has blown away the
fragrance in relations. -Wow.."

1595
01:23:11,616 --> 01:23:14,953
"Because fathers are
getting born after the sons."

1596
01:23:15,036 --> 01:23:15,954
Wow..

1597
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:18,707
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

1598
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:21,209
Uncle, you're really amazing.

1599
01:23:34,222 --> 01:23:35,807
Where's Mr. Mehta?

1600
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:37,100
Mr. Mehta..

1601
01:23:38,351 --> 01:23:39,894
Mr. Mehta passed away.

1602
01:23:42,605 --> 01:23:43,732
Passed away?

1603
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,609
He died.

1604
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:53,116
-When did this happen?
-He suffered an attack late last night.

1605
01:23:53,366 --> 01:23:54,409
And didn't make it.

1606
01:23:54,492 --> 01:23:57,495
The maid told us when she
arrived in the morning and saw him.

1607
01:23:58,371 --> 01:23:59,706
His children are in Wembley.

1608
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,542
This is unbelievable.

1609
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:10,884
'Mr. Mehta, don't laugh so loud.

1610
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:15,055
'Uncle..I want to die laughing.'

1611
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,265
'So what's the problem..
Laugh aloud.'

1612
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:19,100
-'Hey..
-Laugh aloud.'

1613
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:23,521
Where are you taking him?

1614
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:27,567
Get a casket..
We'll give him a proper funeral.

1615
01:24:28,151 --> 01:24:30,737
Look at Mr. Mehta.

1616
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:32,030
He's still smiling.

1617
01:24:33,323 --> 01:24:37,619
Like he got a heart
attack while hearing a joke.

1618
01:24:38,495 --> 01:24:40,955
Excuse me, we're getting late.

1619
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:46,211
Mr. Mehta isn't going anywhere so,
what is he getting late for?

1620
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:47,379
He's dead.

1621
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:49,589
But we've to go..to office.

1622
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:51,257
And you are..

1623
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:54,386
He's Mr. Mehta's beloved son.

1624
01:24:55,178 --> 01:24:57,180
And his grandson,
the apple of his eye.

1625
01:24:57,514 --> 01:25:01,267
And he's his great-grandson,
completely unaware.

1626
01:25:02,602 --> 01:25:06,648
But if you go to the office who will
give him perform the final rites.

1627
01:25:07,107 --> 01:25:08,108
On weekend.

1628
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:10,902
We've fixed his final
rites for Saturday.

1629
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:15,073
-Saturday.. 5 days later.
-Yes.

1630
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:17,158
He's busy.

1631
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:19,994
Out here,
funerals are normally on weekends.

1632
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:22,789
It's your father's final rites.

1633
01:25:23,581 --> 01:25:26,001
Not some picnic which
you can go for on a weekend.

1634
01:25:26,251 --> 01:25:29,170
What's the point of taking an off?

1635
01:25:29,254 --> 01:25:30,338
What's the point?

1636
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:33,425
Tell me something..

1637
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:35,677
You are his son..

1638
01:25:37,554 --> 01:25:39,723
..if you ever fell sick
when you were a kid..

1639
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:42,892
..I am sure Mr. Mehta
took an off from work.

1640
01:25:43,768 --> 01:25:44,811
Didn't he?

1641
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:48,148
So it's your father's final rites.

1642
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:50,692
Can't you take a
one day off from work?

1643
01:25:55,488 --> 01:25:56,906
-Manish.
-Yes, dad.

1644
01:25:57,198 --> 01:25:58,408
Send the ambulance back.

1645
01:25:58,825 --> 01:26:01,327
-We'll perform the final rites today.
-Yes, dad.

1646
01:26:01,369 --> 01:26:03,830
That's more like it.

1647
01:26:04,914 --> 01:26:07,625
Just like you're giving
your father a proper funeral..

1648
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:11,755
..I pray that your son performs
your final rites on a weekday.

1649
01:26:11,838 --> 01:26:12,672
What?

1650
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:14,799
He's trying to say that
you're a great guy.

1651
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,801
Mr. Mehta was the great guy.

1652
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:18,345
Bony.

1653
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:19,637
-Yes, uncle.
-Come here..

1654
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:22,098
Arrange for a band.

1655
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:24,351
We'll send him away in an airplane.

1656
01:26:33,526 --> 01:26:41,826
[English rap song]

1657
01:26:42,452 --> 01:26:44,871
"Have a feast.."

1658
01:26:44,996 --> 01:26:47,290
"..and drink until you drop."

1659
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:52,087
"You don't need to worry..and
dance your sorrows away."

1660
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:56,132
"Don't worry about your next meal."

1661
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,259
"About your next meal.."

1662
01:26:58,343 --> 01:27:00,637
"You'll leave this
world behind someday."

1663
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,847
"You'll leave this
world behind someday."

1664
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:05,225
"You'll leave this
world behind someday."

1665
01:27:05,308 --> 01:27:07,977
"You'll leave this
world behind someday."

1666
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:10,522
"You were born empty-handed
and you'll die the same way."

1667
01:27:10,605 --> 01:27:12,816
"Everyone knows."

1668
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:15,276
"Forget everything else..
and take God's name."

1669
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,153
"He's the only truth."

1670
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:19,781
"His divine plays are unique.."

1671
01:27:19,864 --> 01:27:21,991
"..what kind of life is this."

1672
01:27:22,117 --> 01:27:24,119
"What is this race.."

1673
01:27:24,202 --> 01:27:26,913
"..where you never
listen to yourself."

1674
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,710
"Your eyes are
covered with sorrows."

1675
01:27:31,835 --> 01:27:35,672
"And forget your kin."

1676
01:27:35,755 --> 01:27:43,054
"Don't worry..about
answering calls."

1677
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:46,766
"You'll leave this
world behind someday."

1678
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:49,144
"You'll leave this
world behind someday."

1679
01:27:49,227 --> 01:27:51,438
-"You'll leave this world behind someday."
-Excuse me.

1680
01:27:51,521 --> 01:27:53,523
"You'll leave this
world behind someday."

1681
01:27:53,606 --> 01:27:54,649
Uncle!

1682
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:56,735
What happened?

1683
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,611
-What happened?
-What are you doing?

1684
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:00,947
Mr. Mehta passed away.
We're taking him to the crematorium.

1685
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:02,240
Dancing like this.

1686
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:04,242
You need permission for this.

1687
01:28:04,367 --> 01:28:05,410
Permission.

1688
01:28:05,744 --> 01:28:09,372
"You'll leave this
world behind someday."

1689
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:12,250
What the hell is going on here?

1690
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:14,836
It's Mr. Mehta's..airplane.

1691
01:28:14,878 --> 01:28:16,129
What does that mean?

1692
01:28:16,504 --> 01:28:17,922
Plane. Aircraft.

1693
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:21,551
Have you got a license
to fly this aircraft, sir?

1694
01:28:21,634 --> 01:28:26,765
She's asking whether you
have a license to fly this plane.

1695
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:29,309
I don't even have
a scooter's license.

1696
01:28:29,392 --> 01:28:30,518
He doesn't.

1697
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,103
Arrest everybody.

1698
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:34,356
Dead body, not everybody.

1699
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:37,901
Uncle dearest,
they can arrest anybody.

1700
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:39,819
But dead body is nobody.

1701
01:28:41,154 --> 01:28:42,572
Arrest them.

1702
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:45,283
It's enough.

1703
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:47,035
First, you lost your job.

1704
01:28:47,243 --> 01:28:48,828
Next, you end up
in a police station.

1705
01:28:48,953 --> 01:28:51,915
Plus, a 500-pound penalty.
500 pounds.

1706
01:28:52,082 --> 01:28:55,794
Aunt's always sleepwalking
into our room.

1707
01:28:55,877 --> 01:28:58,713
Uncle is celebrating neighbor's
birthday in our home.

1708
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:00,298
He has a song on fart.

1709
01:29:00,423 --> 01:29:01,466
Fart..Aryan.

1710
01:29:01,633 --> 01:29:02,759
It was a poem.

1711
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:05,428
Doesn't matter..it
still smells the same.

1712
01:29:07,222 --> 01:29:08,973
This is what happens in Punjab.

1713
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:10,725
Hello, Flying Punjab.

1714
01:29:11,309 --> 01:29:14,020
I mean why does he
have to do all this?

1715
01:29:14,104 --> 01:29:17,482
-I think he's loving this.
-Exactly! He's loving this.

1716
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:19,275
But we're not loving this.

1717
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,569
There's no point in
sitting and worrying, Aryan.

1718
01:29:21,653 --> 01:29:22,904
Send them back.

1719
01:29:22,987 --> 01:29:25,699
Exactly what I am thinking,
what should I do?

1720
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,783
How do I send them back?

1721
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:28,868
We must think of a plan..then
put it into action.

1722
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:30,787
"My name Sheila.."

1723
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:33,123
"Sheila's killer youth.."

1724
01:29:33,248 --> 01:29:35,542
"I am too sexy for you.."

1725
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:38,169
"..you can't lay your hands on me."

1726
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:40,296
"My name Sheila.."

1727
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,132
"Sheila's killer youth.."

1728
01:29:42,215 --> 01:29:45,760
-Aryan! I have an idea.
-What?

1729
01:29:52,559 --> 01:29:55,437
"I know you want it
but you never gonna get it."

1730
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,856
"You can never lay hands on me."

1731
01:29:58,189 --> 01:30:02,527
"Believe it or not but the whole
world's crazy about me."

1732
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:07,282
"I feel like slowing
caressing myself."

1733
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:12,078
"I don't need anyone else
when I can love myself."

1734
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:13,580
"What's my name?"

1735
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:14,956
"What's my name?"

1736
01:30:15,081 --> 01:30:16,166
"What's my name?"

1737
01:30:16,249 --> 01:30:18,335
"My name Sheila.."

1738
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:20,712
"Sheila's killer youth.."

1739
01:30:20,795 --> 01:30:22,922
"I am too sexy for you.."

1740
01:30:23,006 --> 01:30:25,467
"..you can't lay your hands on me."

1741
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:27,844
"No, no no Sheila.."

1742
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:30,221
I guess I'm in the wrong home.

1743
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:32,182
"I am too sexy for you.."

1744
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:33,558
Anaya.

1745
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,685
-That sounds like Kake.
-Anaya.

1746
01:30:38,063 --> 01:30:40,315
How dare you turn off the music?

1747
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,484
Stop all this right now, Anaya..

1748
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:43,902
..and take those clothes
off immediately, or else..

1749
01:30:43,985 --> 01:30:46,237
Take them off?
She's hardly wearing any.

1750
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,032
-Clothes..
-Didn't you hear?

1751
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:52,327
How dare you insult my friends?

1752
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:53,870
Would you like to hear more?

1753
01:30:54,996 --> 01:30:57,665
I am leaving this house right now!
Come. Terry-Sherry.

1754
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:00,210
-Go, Terry-Sherry.
-Wait, Terry-Sherry. Wait.

1755
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:02,504
What's the matter, son? What is it?

1756
01:31:02,587 --> 01:31:04,339
Uncle, please don't interfere.

1757
01:31:04,547 --> 01:31:06,007
Anaya, you're still here.

1758
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:08,301
-Go, Terry-Sherry.
-Wait, Terry-Sherry.

1759
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:11,096
Why are you throwing daughter-in-law
out of the house? Tell me.

1760
01:31:11,179 --> 01:31:12,055
I'll tell you.

1761
01:31:12,138 --> 01:31:14,224
I specifically told her
not to wear such clothes.

1762
01:31:14,265 --> 01:31:15,975
Uncle and aunt are
very cultured people.

1763
01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:19,312
They will be shocked to see their
daughter-in-law in such skimpy clothes.

1764
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:21,064
They will leave this home for good.

1765
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:22,023
But she doesn't listen.

1766
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:23,983
Look at how badly
she's dressed. Yuck.

1767
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:26,403
But son, they are not bad at all.

1768
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:28,446
it's so clean.

1769
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:31,199
In fact, even the girls
look so clean and glowing.

1770
01:31:31,908 --> 01:31:32,909
Really?

1771
01:31:33,827 --> 01:31:36,246
Uncle, you think
these clothes are fine?

1772
01:31:36,329 --> 01:31:37,288
Yes.

1773
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:42,293
But you said if I dress
like this again you'll leave us.

1774
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:45,088
-Did I say it?
-Think, uncle.

1775
01:31:45,213 --> 01:31:47,632
You said it on the very first day,
right here.

1776
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:51,052
-I don't remember, son.
-How can you not remember?

1777
01:31:51,177 --> 01:31:52,929
Think harder.

1778
01:31:53,013 --> 01:31:55,682
-Let me think.
-Please..

1779
01:31:55,765 --> 01:31:59,310
Yeah..I don't remember. No..

1780
01:31:59,894 --> 01:32:04,107
And anyway, I had a change
of heart after staying in London.

1781
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,484
-Guddi.
-What?

1782
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:09,946
"What's my name?"

1783
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:13,658
Look who's here?
The lioness of Punjab.

1784
01:32:13,742 --> 01:32:15,160
Come. Come on.

1785
01:32:15,243 --> 01:32:16,911
"I am too sexy for you.."

1786
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:19,873
"..you can't lay your hands on me."

1787
01:32:20,165 --> 01:32:22,417
Your uncle insisted on buying this.

1788
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:25,128
It was on sale near
the Big Ben for 10.

1789
01:32:25,211 --> 01:32:27,047
I bought it for 5 instead.

1790
01:32:28,256 --> 01:32:31,051
By the way, am I looking nice?

1791
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:36,389
She's embarrassed.

1792
01:32:40,226 --> 01:32:42,520
-You're Terry?
-Yes.

1793
01:32:42,604 --> 01:32:45,482
-And you're Sherry?
-Yeah.

1794
01:32:45,982 --> 01:32:48,068
-Whose whiskey is this?
-Mine.

1795
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:49,444
Mine.

1796
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:52,781
I said it's mine.

1797
01:32:52,906 --> 01:32:54,991
Yeah, it was mine, and I drank it.

1798
01:32:57,452 --> 01:32:59,037
"Kake"

1799
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:01,623
Anaya..

1800
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,918
Anaya.. Anaya!

1801
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,003
Listen.

1802
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:09,422
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1803
01:33:11,007 --> 01:33:12,926
Can't you see I
am leaving this house?

1804
01:33:13,176 --> 01:33:15,428
Not that.
Why are you packing my underwear?

1805
01:33:15,553 --> 01:33:16,930
Your's, here..

1806
01:33:20,058 --> 01:33:21,851
-Anaya..
-Why did this guest come here?

1807
01:33:21,935 --> 01:33:23,395
Who invited him over?

1808
01:33:23,895 --> 01:33:26,439
I don't know who.

1809
01:33:27,607 --> 01:33:30,110
Anaya, they come uninvited.

1810
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:38,201
Aryan, please do something..
or I'll do something.

1811
01:33:40,328 --> 01:33:41,454
Fine, don't cry.

1812
01:33:42,205 --> 01:33:46,376
I'll tell them directly that,
I can't take it anymore.

1813
01:33:46,835 --> 01:33:47,836
Okay?

1814
01:33:49,254 --> 01:33:50,338
Bring it, dear.

1815
01:33:56,886 --> 01:34:00,223
By the way,
uncle..you remind me of Punjab.

1816
01:34:00,306 --> 01:34:01,808
-Is it?
-Yes.

1817
01:34:03,685 --> 01:34:06,521
-Don't you miss, Punjab?
-I do, son. Of course, I do.

1818
01:34:09,441 --> 01:34:10,525
I see..

1819
01:34:11,151 --> 01:34:13,653
Uncle..I have a friend.

1820
01:34:13,737 --> 01:34:16,656
He was saying he has
two discounted tickets..

1821
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:18,575
..from London to India.

1822
01:34:18,658 --> 01:34:20,493
-Practically free.
-Really?

1823
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:22,037
-Yeah..
-Wow.

1824
01:34:22,203 --> 01:34:24,330
So..he was saying if
anyone needs me, let me know.

1825
01:34:24,414 --> 01:34:26,958
-Should I tell him?
-Tell him what, son?

1826
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:29,294
If someone needs free tickets.

1827
01:34:30,795 --> 01:34:33,590
I don't know anyone who
wants to go India for free.

1828
01:34:33,965 --> 01:34:36,801
-Guddi, do you?
-No.

1829
01:34:37,427 --> 01:34:38,386
I'll tell you if I know.

1830
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:41,222
But why go to India?
It's so nice here.

1831
01:34:43,224 --> 01:34:46,269
By the way, uncle..in India..

1832
01:34:46,519 --> 01:34:49,731
Actually..it's going to
rain pretty heavily in London.

1833
01:34:49,814 --> 01:34:51,900
The weather will
get really bad, uncle.

1834
01:34:51,983 --> 01:34:53,151
It will rain really heavily.

1835
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:54,319
So where's the problem, son?

1836
01:34:54,402 --> 01:34:56,529
We brought our umbrella along.
Right, Guddi?

1837
01:34:56,905 --> 01:34:58,323
Yes.. in fact I brought two.

1838
01:34:58,365 --> 01:35:01,493
One for the rains and
the other ones for the sun.

1839
01:35:05,413 --> 01:35:07,457
"Kake"

1840
01:35:07,749 --> 01:35:08,875
I am done.

1841
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:11,461
It was fun.

1842
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:17,467
I can't digest these
stuffed bread anymore.

1843
01:35:18,426 --> 01:35:20,345
-He's got..
-Indigestion.

1844
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:22,597
He's got indigestion, aunty.

1845
01:35:22,681 --> 01:35:25,975
Guddi..how about some dessert?

1846
01:35:26,059 --> 01:35:27,602
Let me check.

1847
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:31,147
-So..everything okay?
-Yes, uncle.

1848
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:43,827
-Here you go?
-Guddi..where's the problem.

1849
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:54,796
I have a job interview today,
so I'll be back home early.

1850
01:35:55,005 --> 01:35:56,923
I won't come home until
uncle and aunt are living there.

1851
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:58,967
-Anaya.
-What Anaya, Aryan.

1852
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:01,553
I didn't marry you so that they
can go sightseeing around London..

1853
01:36:01,678 --> 01:36:02,929
..and drive us crazy.

1854
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:05,098
-Anaya, that's not..
-What, Aryan?

1855
01:36:06,516 --> 01:36:07,517
Look..

1856
01:36:08,518 --> 01:36:10,812
They had gone for sightseeing,
isn't it?

1857
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:12,188
Uncle-aunty?

1858
01:36:12,355 --> 01:36:13,857
What are they doing here?

1859
01:36:27,787 --> 01:36:29,581
Where are they going, Aryan?

1860
01:36:29,914 --> 01:36:31,082
Wait.

1861
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:39,424
-Hello.
-Hello, uncle.

1862
01:36:39,507 --> 01:36:41,092
How's your London tour coming about?

1863
01:36:41,176 --> 01:36:42,469
It's just amazing.

1864
01:36:42,552 --> 01:36:45,472
The bus us taking us around.

1865
01:36:45,972 --> 01:36:47,640
I see..so you're on a bus.

1866
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:50,185
Guddi..don't lean down.

1867
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,978
Don't lean down,
you'll fall off the bus.

1868
01:36:52,062 --> 01:36:53,021
What happened, uncle?

1869
01:36:53,104 --> 01:36:55,565
Guddi's trying to lean down
and count the bus' tires.

1870
01:36:55,648 --> 01:36:59,444
I see..aunt's trying
to count the tires.

1871
01:37:00,403 --> 01:37:01,780
Hello..

1872
01:37:02,447 --> 01:37:03,531
Hello..

1873
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,450
Hello, uncle.

1874
01:37:05,533 --> 01:37:07,077
See you in the evening, son.

1875
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:12,624
Why are they lying?

1876
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:15,752
They did it once before.

1877
01:37:59,921 --> 01:38:02,424
-Where could they go?
-Don't know.

1878
01:38:12,434 --> 01:38:13,435
Aryan.

1879
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:27,866
Aryan, what's going on?

1880
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:32,871
Something's definitely wrong.
We must find out.

1881
01:38:39,127 --> 01:38:41,963
Let's search their stuff.
They are hiding something.

1882
01:39:16,873 --> 01:39:17,916
Aryan.

1883
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:24,339
What is all this, Aryan?

1884
01:39:26,257 --> 01:39:27,425
Al-Qaida.

1885
01:39:28,593 --> 01:39:29,761
What now?

1886
01:39:31,388 --> 01:39:34,432
Al-Qaida has the
same rule for everyone.

1887
01:39:36,935 --> 01:39:37,936
Guddi.

1888
01:39:38,019 --> 01:39:41,189
[Foreign language]

1889
01:39:41,272 --> 01:39:45,151
[Foreign language]

1890
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:47,320
The beautiful girl
has made me crazy..

1891
01:39:47,445 --> 01:39:49,030
[Foreign language]

1892
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:52,701
He's got indigestion.

1893
01:39:52,784 --> 01:39:53,660
Guddi..

1894
01:39:53,743 --> 01:39:54,786
[Foreign language]

1895
01:39:58,248 --> 01:39:59,249
Anaya.

1896
01:40:09,884 --> 01:40:11,219
Allah..

1897
01:40:12,846 --> 01:40:14,848
-Why are you screaming?
-What happened?

1898
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:17,726
It's nothing.

1899
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:19,644
Kake, why do you look so scared?

1900
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:21,730
You're back from your sight-seeing?

1901
01:40:21,813 --> 01:40:24,733
He's given me a headache.

1902
01:40:24,774 --> 01:40:27,569
I must admit one thing about London.

1903
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:31,197
Even the kids here know English.

1904
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:34,868
-Daughter-in-law, come here.
-No.

1905
01:40:35,243 --> 01:40:37,162
-Come here..
-Go, go..

1906
01:40:40,874 --> 01:40:43,001
Surgical! Surgical!

1907
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:47,589
It's a fake.

1908
01:40:49,632 --> 01:40:51,134
Here you go, daughter-in-law.

1909
01:40:51,468 --> 01:40:52,427
It's for you.

1910
01:40:53,011 --> 01:40:55,513
Don't you feel like
shooting me sometimes?

1911
01:40:55,597 --> 01:40:57,098
You can use this.

1912
01:40:57,849 --> 01:41:00,602
And these are for your kids.

1913
01:41:00,727 --> 01:41:02,354
But aunty dearest,
they don't have kids.

1914
01:41:02,437 --> 01:41:03,897
They will.

1915
01:41:04,105 --> 01:41:07,233
Toys keep reminding
you that children are due.

1916
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:11,071
Otherwise, people in London
don't have time to have kids.

1917
01:41:11,196 --> 01:41:14,032
Uncle, you're absolutely right.
Absolutely right.

1918
01:41:14,115 --> 01:41:16,534
Take me for instance.
We've been in London for six years..

1919
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:18,119
But it's like we've
been hit by a drought.

1920
01:41:18,203 --> 01:41:20,705
Only one kid in six years. Haroon.

1921
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:21,998
If we were in Pakistan..

1922
01:41:22,082 --> 01:41:24,250
..it would've been Afridi,
Aslam, Sohail..

1923
01:41:24,376 --> 01:41:26,670
..and made an entire
cricket team of 11.

1924
01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:29,130
No brother, 13..

1925
01:41:29,798 --> 01:41:33,677
Uncle, it's cricket.
Only 11 players.

1926
01:41:33,885 --> 01:41:37,222
Both your umpires will
play on your side as well.

1927
01:41:38,056 --> 01:41:39,057
That's true.

1928
01:41:43,103 --> 01:41:44,479
But listen to me.

1929
01:41:44,562 --> 01:41:46,940
-Where are you taking us?
-Where's the problem?

1930
01:41:47,107 --> 01:41:49,442
You have to accompany us
down to the station. -Call Kake.

1931
01:41:49,526 --> 01:41:51,444
What happened? -Guddi..I
hope you didn't leave the tap open.

1932
01:41:51,528 --> 01:41:54,864
-Get in the car, please.
-Someone call Kake.

1933
01:42:01,705 --> 01:42:03,039
How did you do that?

1934
01:42:03,748 --> 01:42:06,960
I called the police and informed
them that uncle's visa has expired.

1935
01:42:07,085 --> 01:42:08,336
How do you know?

1936
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:11,089
I saw uncle's passport.

1937
01:42:11,256 --> 01:42:12,966
He only had two month's visa left.

1938
01:42:13,258 --> 01:42:15,093
And he's been here
for more than three months.

1939
01:42:15,176 --> 01:42:17,429
The police will
automatically send them back.

1940
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,645
I'm gonna ask you few questions,
please answer correctly.

1941
01:42:25,729 --> 01:42:28,940
Please call our son.

1942
01:42:29,482 --> 01:42:31,985
First please answer his questions.

1943
01:42:32,902 --> 01:42:34,154
Okay.

1944
01:42:34,237 --> 01:42:38,116
-Sir, please tell me your name.
-Gangasharan Gandotra.

1945
01:42:38,199 --> 01:42:42,370
-And your name please.
-Shazia Khan.

1946
01:42:43,913 --> 01:42:45,415
Can I see your papers?

1947
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:49,502
-Paper?
-Where's your visa and passport?

1948
01:42:52,255 --> 01:42:59,095
Can I..make a call?

1949
01:42:59,262 --> 01:43:00,972
Who would you like to call?

1950
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:12,025
Aryan.

1951
01:43:17,155 --> 01:43:18,239
Hey..

1952
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:24,371
Finally, we're free from slavery.

1953
01:43:25,246 --> 01:43:26,623
Now, this is our home.

1954
01:43:27,082 --> 01:43:30,293
We'll do whatever we want
and wherever we want.

1955
01:43:32,295 --> 01:43:35,590
We'll eat in the bathroom,
take a shower in the bedroom.

1956
01:43:36,007 --> 01:43:38,593
And make-out in the kitchen.

1957
01:43:38,677 --> 01:43:39,761
Daughter-in-law.

1958
01:43:40,011 --> 01:43:41,096
Kake..

1959
01:43:43,765 --> 01:43:45,850
Are you hungry too?

1960
01:43:47,852 --> 01:43:49,396
Uncle, you're at home.

1961
01:43:49,479 --> 01:43:52,190
I came home early today.

1962
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:53,942
Took a nap because I was tired.

1963
01:43:54,067 --> 01:43:55,694
Guddi's still sleeping.

1964
01:43:57,278 --> 01:43:59,614
-Do you know what happened today?
-No.

1965
01:43:59,698 --> 01:44:01,741
The police arrested me.

1966
01:44:02,826 --> 01:44:04,327
-Police?
-The police arrested me.

1967
01:44:04,452 --> 01:44:07,831
Some stupid moron
called them and said..

1968
01:44:07,872 --> 01:44:09,332
..that our visa has expired.

1969
01:44:09,624 --> 01:44:11,042
And we're living her illegal.

1970
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:12,043
And?

1971
01:44:12,085 --> 01:44:15,296
They don't know that
we've high connections.

1972
01:44:16,131 --> 01:44:18,717
I already got a one-year visa.

1973
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,468
-During your wedding.
-What?

1974
01:44:20,677 --> 01:44:23,054
Bony Singh, Pony's husband.

1975
01:44:23,138 --> 01:44:25,348
He works at the embassy. Yeah.

1976
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:28,351
And this time I asked him
to get me a six month's extension.

1977
01:44:29,227 --> 01:44:30,687
You two will have kids too.

1978
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:33,982
Silly Guddi keeps
everything in the fridge.

1979
01:44:35,984 --> 01:44:36,985
Look.

1980
01:44:38,403 --> 01:44:41,364
Uncle, you went through
so much and didn't call.

1981
01:44:41,448 --> 01:44:43,324
-We're not strangers..
-We didn't have to.

1982
01:44:43,366 --> 01:44:46,453
Bony Singh arrived
immediately and got us out.

1983
01:44:46,536 --> 01:44:47,495
See..

1984
01:44:48,204 --> 01:44:52,500
-Uncle..aunt's name on this is..
-It's Shazia Khan.

1985
01:44:52,625 --> 01:44:53,752
She's a Muslim.

1986
01:44:54,669 --> 01:44:57,881
But how can you two have
separate surnames after marriage?

1987
01:44:57,964 --> 01:45:01,092
I married your aunt Guddi,
not her surname.

1988
01:45:01,509 --> 01:45:04,471
I married a human being,
not a Muslim.

1989
01:45:06,056 --> 01:45:07,932
Would you like to eat something,
daughter-in-law?

1990
01:45:08,058 --> 01:45:09,809
No, uncle. We already ate.

1991
01:45:09,893 --> 01:45:11,519
-Goodnight.
-And you, son.

1992
01:45:11,561 --> 01:45:14,647
I am not hungry, uncle.

1993
01:45:15,732 --> 01:45:17,067
Kake..

1994
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:18,818
Listen.

1995
01:45:23,073 --> 01:45:24,741
Is everything okay?

1996
01:45:25,158 --> 01:45:26,576
No problems?

1997
01:45:27,369 --> 01:45:29,537
Let me know if you ever have one.

1998
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,290
-We're family, okay.
-Yes.

1999
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:34,000
-Understood?
-Yes..

2000
01:45:34,751 --> 01:45:36,211
Bless you.

2001
01:45:37,253 --> 01:45:40,590
-Bless you. Go on.
-Okay, Uncle..

2002
01:46:05,573 --> 01:46:09,744
You've been driving
for almost an hour, son.

2003
01:46:09,828 --> 01:46:12,038
Where are we going?

2004
01:46:12,163 --> 01:46:13,873
Uncle, we're going to Scotland.

2005
01:46:13,957 --> 01:46:17,168
There's a big temple out there.
I thought I must take you two there.

2006
01:46:17,711 --> 01:46:19,629
So that's the case..

2007
01:46:19,713 --> 01:46:23,800
Son, your name should've
been Shravan Kumar instead.

2008
01:46:23,883 --> 01:46:25,135
See Guddi..

2009
01:46:25,343 --> 01:46:30,181
Now that's a sweet thought,
just like your pickles.

2010
01:46:31,016 --> 01:46:32,600
Let it go.

2011
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:35,770
But why pack all our luggage?

2012
01:46:35,854 --> 01:46:37,480
And my umbrella as well.

2013
01:46:37,564 --> 01:46:38,398
See..

2014
01:46:38,481 --> 01:46:40,442
Well, aunty,
it could take a day or two.

2015
01:46:40,608 --> 01:46:42,694
So I thought I'll
give you a proper tour.

2016
01:46:42,777 --> 01:46:46,114
But son, we must return
to London tomorrow.

2017
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,866
-Why, uncle?
-Yes..

2018
01:46:47,949 --> 01:46:49,492
Well..I..

2019
01:46:49,659 --> 01:46:51,327
There's a prayer
meeting in the Gurdwara.

2020
01:46:51,411 --> 01:46:52,871
Yes, prayer meet in Gurdwara.

2021
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,124
Will we come back?

2022
01:46:58,043 --> 01:47:00,795
-Yes, we will.
-Great.. great.

2023
01:47:01,296 --> 01:47:02,589
Carry on, dear.

2024
01:47:07,218 --> 01:47:08,928
[Foreign Language]

2025
01:47:09,054 --> 01:47:10,513
Is uncle at home?

2026
01:47:11,431 --> 01:47:12,974
His parcel's arrived.

2027
01:47:13,683 --> 01:47:16,561
-What's in it?
-God knows what.

2028
01:47:17,228 --> 01:47:19,439
They delivered it at
my address two days ago.

2029
01:47:19,522 --> 01:47:22,817
They said they will collect it.
They are leaving tomorrow.

2030
01:47:23,443 --> 01:47:26,446
So I thought I'll deliver
it personally, or they might forget.

2031
01:47:26,905 --> 01:47:28,782
Where are they?

2032
01:47:39,584 --> 01:47:40,960
My body is paining.

2033
01:47:44,714 --> 01:47:47,050
Kake, are we in Scotland?

2034
01:47:47,425 --> 01:47:49,260
No, uncle.
I just stopped for coffee.

2035
01:47:49,344 --> 01:47:51,388
That's great, son.

2036
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:53,682
Haven't eaten anything
since morning. Come on.

2037
01:48:00,397 --> 01:48:01,439
I'll try calling him.

2038
01:48:01,523 --> 01:48:03,817
'Please leave a massage..'

2039
01:48:06,736 --> 01:48:10,073
-Two coffee, please.
-Just two?

2040
01:48:12,575 --> 01:48:13,910
Yeah, just two.

2041
01:48:22,210 --> 01:48:23,962
Why don't you eat
something too, son?

2042
01:48:24,087 --> 01:48:25,714
You haven't eaten
anything since morning.

2043
01:48:25,797 --> 01:48:27,424
I am not hungry.

2044
01:48:27,674 --> 01:48:30,260
You didn't eat anything
in the car either.

2045
01:48:30,802 --> 01:48:33,972
I think you don't
like aunt's cooking.

2046
01:48:34,097 --> 01:48:35,265
That's not true.

2047
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,434
You two have really spoiled us.

2048
01:48:37,809 --> 01:48:39,144
I'll really miss you two.

2049
01:48:40,353 --> 01:48:41,271
Miss us?

2050
01:48:41,479 --> 01:48:43,189
Where are you going?

2051
01:48:57,871 --> 01:48:59,581
What happened, son?
Looking for something.

2052
01:48:59,664 --> 01:49:02,250
Aunty, I think I left
my phone in the car.

2053
01:49:03,335 --> 01:49:04,210
I'll go get it.

2054
01:49:04,294 --> 01:49:06,129
Yeah, or someone might steal it.

2055
01:49:13,219 --> 01:49:15,680
-Go on.
-Yes.

2056
01:49:18,308 --> 01:49:19,768
That boy's too much..

2057
01:49:26,775 --> 01:49:29,569
Kake's a nice soul.

2058
01:49:32,405 --> 01:49:35,033
-Coffee's here.
-Your coffee.

2059
01:49:36,659 --> 01:49:37,994
Only two?

2060
01:49:39,662 --> 01:49:42,123
Three.. my son.

2061
01:49:42,624 --> 01:49:44,417
He only ordered two.

2062
01:49:46,544 --> 01:49:48,213
Says he only ordered two.

2063
01:49:48,296 --> 01:49:51,591
No-no.. My son coming. Three.

2064
01:49:51,716 --> 01:49:52,884
Three coffee..

2065
01:49:53,385 --> 01:49:55,095
Sir, he has gone.

2066
01:49:55,637 --> 01:49:57,222
Your luggage is there.

2067
01:50:32,799 --> 01:50:34,968
He must have gone somewhere around.

2068
01:50:35,927 --> 01:50:37,012
He'll be back soon.

2069
01:50:37,095 --> 01:50:39,055
-Right?
-Yes.

2070
01:50:50,233 --> 01:50:51,526
Excuse me.

2071
01:50:52,193 --> 01:50:54,529
Do you need anything?
I am closing for the day.

2072
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:56,865
It's okay..
It's okay..

2073
01:51:00,076 --> 01:51:02,996
No need to worry,
he won't desert us.

2074
01:51:03,747 --> 01:51:05,081
Right?

2075
01:51:44,245 --> 01:51:45,497
I left them.

2076
01:51:46,456 --> 01:51:50,043
-Where?
-Don't know, I just did.

2077
01:52:09,646 --> 01:52:11,564
Something is not right, Aryan.

2078
01:52:16,152 --> 01:52:17,696
What is all this?

2079
01:52:20,323 --> 01:52:22,117
Something's definitely wrong.

2080
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:29,332
Aryan, call uncle.

2081
01:52:38,008 --> 01:52:39,259
What?

2082
01:52:45,974 --> 01:52:47,475
100,000 pounds.

2083
01:52:48,059 --> 01:52:51,187
Who deposited 70,00,000
rupees in your account?

2084
01:53:18,465 --> 01:53:19,716
This stuff belongs to Ajay.

2085
01:53:21,134 --> 01:53:22,135
Ajay Gandotra.

2086
01:53:23,762 --> 01:53:25,555
His parents are staying with you.

2087
01:53:25,847 --> 01:53:28,141
Yes, uncle and aunty.

2088
01:53:29,351 --> 01:53:30,852
How are you related to them?

2089
01:53:31,144 --> 01:53:34,856
They were our guests,
came to London for sightseeing.

2090
01:53:35,148 --> 01:53:37,317
They didn't come to
London for sightseeing.

2091
01:53:38,568 --> 01:53:41,112
They were here to collect
their son's belongings.

2092
01:53:42,447 --> 01:53:43,782
Their son, Ajay Gandotra.

2093
01:53:43,907 --> 01:53:44,908
IT pass-out.

2094
01:53:45,617 --> 01:53:47,285
He used to work in this office.

2095
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:49,704
9/11..

2096
01:53:51,164 --> 01:53:53,166
He was in New York
on official business.

2097
01:53:55,168 --> 01:53:59,047
At the World Trade Centre
during the incident.

2098
01:54:00,548 --> 01:54:02,217
They never even recovered the body.

2099
01:54:04,678 --> 01:54:07,597
His mother suffered a stroke
hearing the news of his death.

2100
01:54:08,973 --> 01:54:12,894
It took her 8 years
to get back on her feet.

2101
01:54:16,731 --> 01:54:19,359
His mother wanted to pray
one last time for his son..

2102
01:54:21,027 --> 01:54:22,070
..at Ground Zero..

2103
01:54:23,738 --> 01:54:25,365
..where her son died.

2104
01:54:28,993 --> 01:54:30,704
They came here three months ago.

2105
01:54:32,455 --> 01:54:35,583
My son used to work
in such a huge office.

2106
01:54:38,169 --> 01:54:40,380
He was a great guy, great friend.

2107
01:54:41,548 --> 01:54:42,590
Great, son.

2108
01:54:47,095 --> 01:54:53,601
I was saying..is it okay
if we collect his stuff later?

2109
01:54:53,685 --> 01:54:54,853
No problem at all.

2110
01:54:55,437 --> 01:54:57,814
You see..we've a son in London..

2111
01:54:58,148 --> 01:54:59,357
I mean..he's like a son.

2112
01:54:59,607 --> 01:55:02,193
And he's getting married.
So a few days later..

2113
01:55:02,318 --> 01:55:04,320
No problem at all.
We'll do as you say.

2114
01:55:04,571 --> 01:55:05,363
Yes.

2115
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:09,826
Okay.

2116
01:55:13,163 --> 01:55:16,332
They waited 9 years to
collect their son's stuff..

2117
01:55:17,584 --> 01:55:21,504
His mother waited 9 years
to pray one last time for him..

2118
01:55:22,964 --> 01:55:25,800
And yet, they sacrificed
three more months for you two.

2119
01:55:27,302 --> 01:55:29,554
They did come here a few days ago.

2120
01:55:30,096 --> 01:55:31,848
'Please do me a favor, son.'

2121
01:55:34,017 --> 01:55:37,854
'Have this stuff
sent to this address.'

2122
01:55:38,355 --> 01:55:40,607
'Those two got recently married.'

2123
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:45,445
'I don't want to make Aryan
emotional by telling him our story.'

2124
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:47,322
Okay.

2125
01:55:50,867 --> 01:55:53,620
Uncle..Ajay has an insurance
amount in his name.

2126
01:55:54,371 --> 01:55:56,748
100,000 pounds.
Around 7-8 million rupees.

2127
01:55:57,540 --> 01:56:00,251
Give me your account number,
and I'll get it transferred.

2128
01:56:00,335 --> 01:56:02,295
Our son was priceless.

2129
01:56:02,921 --> 01:56:04,255
And this money..

2130
01:56:04,339 --> 01:56:10,553
And how can any parents..accept
their son's insurance money?

2131
01:56:12,681 --> 01:56:18,103
Transfer that money to our
son's account who lives in London.

2132
01:56:18,228 --> 01:56:20,063
I'll send you all the details.

2133
01:56:20,605 --> 01:56:21,981
Okay.

2134
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:25,652
They were saintly people.

2135
01:56:26,653 --> 01:56:33,201
No desires..and nothing to lose.

2136
01:56:39,082 --> 01:56:46,381
"We've no more desires.."

2137
01:56:47,966 --> 01:56:55,181
"..and nothing to lose."

2138
01:56:55,265 --> 01:56:58,727
"O Eminent One.."

2139
01:56:58,810 --> 01:57:02,439
"O Eminent One.."

2140
01:57:02,522 --> 01:57:09,821
"Almighty."

2141
01:57:14,617 --> 01:57:18,747
"Almighty."

2142
01:57:23,543 --> 01:57:27,380
"Almighty."

2143
01:57:27,505 --> 01:57:32,344
"Almighty."

2144
01:57:32,427 --> 01:57:41,811
"Says the saint, Hussain.."

2145
01:57:43,605 --> 01:57:50,904
"Hussain.."

2146
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:56,534
"Hussain.."

2147
01:58:02,665 --> 01:58:06,127
"Says the saint, Hussain.."

2148
01:58:06,252 --> 01:58:09,839
"My name's Sai.."

2149
01:58:09,923 --> 01:58:16,888
"..you mean everything to mean."

2150
01:58:17,514 --> 01:58:24,771
"Only You can make
things right again."

2151
01:58:24,854 --> 01:58:31,695
"Only You can make
things right again."

2152
01:58:31,778 --> 01:58:34,739
"Just You.."

2153
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:43,873
"Just You.."

2154
01:58:43,957 --> 01:58:48,545
"Just You.."

2155
01:58:49,379 --> 01:58:53,717
"Just You.."

2156
01:58:54,134 --> 01:58:57,012
"Almighty."

2157
01:58:57,095 --> 01:58:59,681
"Almighty."

2158
01:58:59,931 --> 01:59:06,938
"Only You can make
things right again."

2159
01:59:07,313 --> 01:59:13,028
"Only You can make
things right again."

2160
01:59:14,404 --> 01:59:18,116
"O my Lord.."

2161
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:23,913
"O my Lord.."

2162
01:59:23,997 --> 01:59:30,378
"Only You can make
things right again."

2163
01:59:31,338 --> 01:59:38,470
"You're the One that binds
us..You're the One that bonds us."

2164
01:59:38,553 --> 01:59:45,852
"You're the One that binds
us..You're the One that bonds us."

2165
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:53,360
"You mean everything to mean.."

2166
01:59:53,568 --> 02:00:00,825
"You mean everything to mean.."

2167
02:00:00,909 --> 02:00:06,581
"Only You can make
things right again."

2168
02:00:06,664 --> 02:00:08,208
I know where we can find them.

2169
02:00:08,249 --> 02:00:12,045
"Only You can make
things right again."

2170
02:00:12,170 --> 02:00:20,512
"Only You can make
things right again."

2171
02:00:21,388 --> 02:00:24,641
"Just You.."

2172
02:00:27,143 --> 02:00:31,648
"Just You.."

2173
02:00:32,524 --> 02:00:35,985
"Just You.."

2174
02:00:37,862 --> 02:00:39,614
'Guddi..Kake on the line.'

2175
02:00:39,698 --> 02:00:41,533
-'Hello, mom.
-Kake..'

2176
02:00:41,658 --> 02:00:44,744
'Where are you?
You don't even call.'

2177
02:00:44,828 --> 02:00:47,539
-'Don't you miss your mother?
-Let it be..'

2178
02:00:47,622 --> 02:00:49,249
'I am always thinking about you so,
how can I miss you?'

2179
02:00:49,332 --> 02:00:51,459
'Liar..that's why you don't call.'

2180
02:00:51,584 --> 02:00:52,877
'I was busy.'

2181
02:00:52,961 --> 02:00:55,213
'I am in America.. New York.'

2182
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:58,633
'On official business.
Such a beautiful place.'

2183
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,343
'Such a rush..so many people.'

2184
02:01:00,385 --> 02:01:02,012
'If you get lost here,
it's won't be easy to find.'

2185
02:01:02,137 --> 02:01:04,305
'I am standing right here.
On the steps.'

2186
02:01:05,265 --> 02:01:08,018
'What a beautiful place.
What a view.'

2187
02:01:08,727 --> 02:01:09,686
'What a life.'

2188
02:01:09,769 --> 02:01:12,856
'Stupid fool..enjoying
the view alone?'

2189
02:01:12,897 --> 02:01:15,567
Let it be..you've grown old.

2190
02:01:15,692 --> 02:01:18,653
But don't worry.
I'll bring you here soon.

2191
02:01:18,862 --> 02:01:21,740
We'll have a drink together
and enjoy the view.

2192
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:26,995
You know, mom..they say that when
you meet someone at Times Square..

2193
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:30,582
..then you definitely
meet him again here.

2194
02:01:43,595 --> 02:01:50,310
"You're in me..and on the outside."

2195
02:01:51,144 --> 02:01:58,109
"You're in me..and on the outside."

2196
02:01:58,193 --> 02:02:02,530
"You dwell in every inch of me."

2197
02:02:02,781 --> 02:02:04,157
Do you know where I am going, mom?

2198
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:06,951
America's tallest building.
World Trade Centre.

2199
02:02:07,077 --> 02:02:08,578
In front of me.

2200
02:02:09,287 --> 02:02:12,707
I'll show you when you come here.

2201
02:02:12,791 --> 02:02:14,501
'Hard to say if we'll
ever get to go there.'

2202
02:02:14,584 --> 02:02:15,919
'But I want you to come back.'

2203
02:02:16,002 --> 02:02:18,630
'It's been really long
since we last saw you.'

2204
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:22,217
Let it be..close your eyes and see.

2205
02:02:23,051 --> 02:02:26,096
I am right here and
Twin Towers is behind me.

2206
02:02:26,179 --> 02:02:33,478
"Only You can make
things right again."

2207
02:02:33,561 --> 02:02:38,358
"Only You can make
things right again."

2208
02:03:05,552 --> 02:03:09,389
"Only You can make
things right again."

2209
02:03:50,221 --> 02:03:51,389
Kaka..

2210
02:03:53,558 --> 02:03:55,101
Our son.

2211
02:03:56,269 --> 02:03:57,562
Guddi.

2212
02:03:58,855 --> 02:04:00,482
Kaka's gone.

2213
02:04:02,317 --> 02:04:04,235
He won't come back.

2214
02:04:06,488 --> 02:04:09,657
Yes.. he's gone.

2215
02:04:10,867 --> 02:04:12,619
Our son's gone.

2216
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:17,082
Our son's gone.

2217
02:04:19,501 --> 02:04:21,503
-Our son's gone.
-Guddi..

2218
02:04:35,517 --> 02:04:38,770
It's our son's name.

2219
02:04:41,356 --> 02:04:45,193
What did my son do to deserve this?

2220
02:04:46,486 --> 02:04:48,446
He never harmed anyone.

2221
02:04:49,781 --> 02:04:51,324
We had only one son.

2222
02:04:52,575 --> 02:04:58,373
And the entire day we
would keep taking his name.

2223
02:05:01,751 --> 02:05:03,837
He looked just like you, son.

2224
02:05:06,297 --> 02:05:09,676
Tall..handsome..

2225
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:11,886
He's gone now.

2226
02:05:13,638 --> 02:05:14,806
Uncle.

2227
02:05:14,931 --> 02:05:20,228
We only came to collect his stuff,
not to trouble you.

2228
02:05:21,229 --> 02:05:23,565
I kept telling Guddi
that we should leave.

2229
02:05:23,648 --> 02:05:26,484
Kake must be feeling bothered.
But she's a dimwit.

2230
02:05:26,568 --> 02:05:29,696
She kept saying we'll leave
only after help them settle down.

2231
02:05:30,572 --> 02:05:33,116
We couldn't get our son married.

2232
02:05:33,533 --> 02:05:35,785
But when we got you two married..

2233
02:05:36,077 --> 02:05:38,496
..it felt like our son
was getting married.

2234
02:05:41,249 --> 02:05:44,544
If we made a mistake,
please forgive us.

2235
02:05:44,669 --> 02:05:47,088
No, uncle.
In fact, we made a mistake.

2236
02:05:47,756 --> 02:05:49,507
We're not used to
living with someone.

2237
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:52,427
We couldn't understand
your love and care.

2238
02:05:52,886 --> 02:05:55,180
We're like fake dog lovers.

2239
02:05:56,348 --> 02:05:59,934
We love humans
like we love our pets.

2240
02:06:01,061 --> 02:06:02,896
When we want we
let them come close..

2241
02:06:03,521 --> 02:06:05,565
..and when we don't,
we shoo them off.

2242
02:06:07,984 --> 02:06:09,361
What about their feelings?

2243
02:06:09,903 --> 02:06:11,488
What feelings? He's just a dog.

2244
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:15,158
We treated you the same way.

2245
02:06:16,534 --> 02:06:20,830
Once our intentions were fulfilled,
we cast you out on the streets.

2246
02:06:21,498 --> 02:06:23,583
We even got married for a reason.

2247
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:27,587
But you two explained us
the right reason.

2248
02:06:30,090 --> 02:06:32,926
-We're very sorry.
-No, dear.

2249
02:06:34,135 --> 02:06:36,262
We should've understood.

2250
02:06:38,056 --> 02:06:41,059
Children are like clay toys.

2251
02:06:41,685 --> 02:06:44,646
Hold them hard and they break.

2252
02:06:45,271 --> 02:06:50,735
We.. we held on too hard.

2253
02:06:51,695 --> 02:06:54,864
-Please, aunt.
-What are you two saying?

2254
02:06:55,699 --> 02:06:58,368
Would you have apologized
if it was your own son?

2255
02:06:58,827 --> 02:07:00,578
Would he have let you apologize?

2256
02:07:04,249 --> 02:07:07,836
You just won my heart, son.

2257
02:07:09,045 --> 02:07:11,881
Our son would've said let it be..

2258
02:07:12,007 --> 02:07:13,842
And would've given us a tight hug.

2259
02:07:25,687 --> 02:07:34,029
"I don't understand anything."

2260
02:07:47,208 --> 02:07:55,550
"I am the garbage
lying on the streets."

2261
02:07:59,304 --> 02:08:02,098
"Lord..

2262
02:08:02,182 --> 02:08:08,688
I'm seeking your refuge."

2263
02:08:09,105 --> 02:08:16,196
"Lord..

2264
02:08:16,237 --> 02:08:21,201
I'm seeking your refuge."

2265
02:08:25,497 --> 02:08:27,665
We Indians are so weird.

2266
02:08:29,125 --> 02:08:32,003
First, we treat guests like God.

2267
02:08:32,629 --> 02:08:35,006
And then find ways
to get rid of them.

2268
02:08:35,965 --> 02:08:37,425
Kake..

2269
02:08:37,634 --> 02:08:39,427
-Uncle.
-Daughter-in-law.

2270
02:08:39,511 --> 02:08:42,430
-Aunty.
-Come on..

2271
02:08:42,514 --> 02:08:44,099
How do you make such sudden plans?

2272
02:08:44,182 --> 02:08:45,183
First, take my blessings.

2273
02:08:45,266 --> 02:08:46,476
It wasn't sudden, dear.

2274
02:08:46,518 --> 02:08:47,894
As soon as we found out that..

2275
02:08:47,977 --> 02:08:51,773
..daughter-in-law is expecting
we couldn't control ourselves.

2276
02:08:51,898 --> 02:08:54,651
We booked our tickets three months
ago. We got the cheapest tickets.

2277
02:08:54,734 --> 02:08:58,988
I won't leave until I give them a
proper massage and make them strong.

2278
02:08:59,114 --> 02:09:01,241
But I'll take them to school.

2279
02:09:01,324 --> 02:09:02,909
I'll take them to the park.

2280
02:09:02,992 --> 02:09:05,412
-They will play with me.
-But I'll feed them.

2281
02:09:05,495 --> 02:09:07,872
Don't just stand there.

2282
02:09:07,997 --> 02:09:09,416
We'll tell you the rest at home.

2283
02:09:09,499 --> 02:09:11,167
Go, get our luggage.

2284
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:13,628
So..everything fine.

2285
02:09:13,712 --> 02:09:14,838
Everything fine, uncle.

2286
02:09:14,921 --> 02:09:17,590
-Son. Listen..
-Yes, uncle..

2287
02:09:18,591 --> 02:09:20,677
We don't want to be a burden on you.

2288
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,387
We can stay in some
hotel if you like.

2289
02:09:22,470 --> 02:09:24,305
-Guddi?
-Right.

2290
02:09:24,389 --> 02:09:27,267
We don't want to trouble
you two, children.

2291
02:09:27,350 --> 02:09:31,396
It's no trouble at all, aunty,
you're like family.

2292
02:09:31,604 --> 02:09:35,442
But if you insist on staying
at a hotel, I can't stop you.

2293
02:09:35,567 --> 02:09:36,860
How?

2294
02:09:37,277 --> 02:09:40,989
I'll slap you. Are we strangers?

2295
02:09:41,072 --> 02:09:43,116
You've every right to stop us.

2296
02:09:43,324 --> 02:09:46,244
Trying stopping us.
And see whether to stay or not.

2297
02:09:47,037 --> 02:09:48,246
Go on.

2298
02:09:49,956 --> 02:09:51,041
Go on.

2299
02:09:51,124 --> 02:09:53,710
-Please stay, uncle.
-We're staying.

2300
02:10:00,008 --> 02:10:01,760
"Your youth's so intoxicating."

2301
02:10:01,843 --> 02:10:03,636
"Let's begin this story."

2302
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:05,513
"I am a local boy.."

2303
02:10:05,638 --> 02:10:07,682
"..but I can make the
English queen dance."

2304
02:10:07,766 --> 02:10:09,267
"Let's scream and shout."

2305
02:10:09,351 --> 02:10:11,311
"Music's loud too."

2306
02:10:11,394 --> 02:10:13,271
"My style's totally crazy.."

2307
02:10:13,396 --> 02:10:14,272
"Baby.."

2308
02:10:14,356 --> 02:10:17,400
"O beloved.."

2309
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:21,321
"O beloved.."

2310
02:10:21,363 --> 02:10:24,616
"O beloved.."

2311
02:10:25,033 --> 02:10:27,994
"O beloved.."

2312
02:10:33,083 --> 02:10:36,503
"Let's mix some love with alcohol.."

2313
02:10:36,628 --> 02:10:40,090
"Let's mix some love with alcohol.."

2314
02:10:40,215 --> 02:10:43,843
"..you're a closed
bottle of intoxication."

2315
02:10:43,968 --> 02:10:48,682
"..you're a closed
bottle of intoxication."

2316
02:10:56,648 --> 02:11:00,235
"You're my destiny..
you're my fate."

2317
02:11:00,318 --> 02:11:03,947
"With you, life feels complete."

2318
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:05,949
"Get me high on love."

2319
02:11:06,032 --> 02:11:07,617
"Let our hearts unite."

2320
02:11:07,701 --> 02:11:10,662
"My gorgeous beloved."

2321
02:11:10,745 --> 02:11:14,249
"Douse the craving in my eyes.."

2322
02:11:14,332 --> 02:11:17,544
"Let's mix some love with alcohol.."

2323
02:11:17,627 --> 02:11:19,087
"Mix some.."

2324
02:11:19,713 --> 02:11:23,174
"O beloved.."

2325
02:11:23,299 --> 02:11:30,223
"O beloved.."

2326
02:11:30,348 --> 02:11:34,644
"O beloved.."

2327
02:11:35,061 --> 02:11:39,357
"Anyone you touch goes
out of control, what to do."

2328
02:11:39,441 --> 02:11:41,359
"Your beauty's intoxicating
you've got me trapped."

2329
02:11:41,443 --> 02:11:43,319
"Tell me, baby, what to do."
