1
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,320
'This is war.'

2
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,200
'This is a war between us
and the infidels.'

3
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
'Whether I kill them'

4
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,880
'or die in the process'

5
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,480
'it is heaven I am destined for.'

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,200
Thank you. Welcome to America.

8
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Next please.

9
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,160
Good morning.

10
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,320
Just one moment please.

11
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
Could you come down, please?

12
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Mr. Khan?

13
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,360
What is the purpose of
your visit to the United States?

14
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,800
Could you please
step outside the line?

15
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,040
{\an8}Breaking news from the USA!

16
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,120
{\an8}The country's biggest superstar,
Shah Rukh Khan

17
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,960
{\an8}has been detained
at New York airport.

18
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,320
{\an8}He was interrogated for two hours.

19
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,000
Shah Rukh was on his way to Chicago

20
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,960
to participate
in an Independence day event.

21
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,440
According to our sources

22
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,600
the Indian embassy had to
intervene and get him released.

23
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,040
In a telephonic interview,
Shah Rukh Khan said..

24
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,160
'Whenever I start feeling
too arrogant about myself'

25
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,536
'I always take a trip to America.'

26
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,800
'In the immigration, guys kick
the star out of stardom.'

27
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,000
In case you've forgotten,
let me remind you.

28
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,640
Hyderabad serial blast, 42 dead,
90 injured.

29
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Jaipur serial blast, 63 dead,
210 injured.

30
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,360
Ahmedabad serial blast, 56 dead,
over 200 injured.

31
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,160
Delhi serial blast,
30 dead and over 100 injured.

32
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
{\an8}And now, the Pune Kitchen blast

33
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,240
{\an8}17 dead and 60 injured.

34
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,800
It's a joke!

35
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,800
In spite of having all these
agencies and funds at our disposal

36
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
we have not been able to identify

37
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,360
who is behind these blasts
that have been taking place

38
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,600
one after another,
over the last three years.

39
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
Have you read this?

40
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,120
'Ghost who bombs'!

41
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,920
'India's Osama Bin Laden'!

42
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,480
'Terrorists on a rampage,
police sit idle'!

43
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,600
A stranger comes,
carries out a blast and leaves

44
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,080
before our secret agencies
can get a whiff of it.

45
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,320
IB

46
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,240
RAW

47
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,560
Special Cell.

48
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,920
State ATS nobody knows
who this Ghost is!

49
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Sir!

50
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,640
We're trying our level best, sir.

51
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
You've been trying
for the last three years.

52
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,400
Where are the results?

53
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,720
Where are the results?

54
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,320
People are dying,
businesses are losing money

55
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,680
share prices are dropping,
tourism has been impacted.

56
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,360
Tourists think India is unsafe.

57
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,680
We've become a joke in
the international community.

58
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,000
Sir, all the information
that we've received from

59
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,320
technical surveillance,
interrogations and reliable sources

60
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
have the same report.

61
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,160
Even grassroots intelligence
reports indicate that

62
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,440
our most wanted people
are either in Pakistan or Dubai.

63
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,320
Fine!

64
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,280
Then let's relax
and listen to music.

65
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,160
Play us a song!

66
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,800
Sir!

67
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,920
Sorry to interrupt, sir!

68
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
Mumbai ATS.

69
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,960
We've got CCTV footage
of The Pune Kitchen.

70
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,720
A man enters the cafe with a bag

71
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,960
but leaves without it.

72
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,680
Who is this man?

73
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,800
Yusuf.

74
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,640
His family said that they
haven't seen him in eight years.

75
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,960
Nobody knows
what he looks like now.

76
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Yes?

77
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
What? Where?

78
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
God!

79
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,040
There's been a serial blast
in Mumbai

80
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,360
27 dead and 150 injured.

81
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
If all the terrorists
are in Pakistan and Dubai

82
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,160
then is it a ghost who's
carrying out these blasts?

83
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,280
'I don't have a problem
with infidels.'

84
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,720
'If they destroy our lives'

85
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,960
'a retaliation is inevitable.'

86
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,760
You look like a bloody
government slave!

87
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,120
What the hell are
you doing in the jungle?

88
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,640
I've come from the neighbouring
village to collect mushrooms.

89
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,456
Oh! You've come here from
the neighbouring village

90
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
to collect mushrooms?

91
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,600
Do I look like a fool?

92
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,480
I don't just look like
a bloody government slave.

93
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,960
I am one.

94
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,400
Where's the doctor
you've kidnapped?

95
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,720
Where is the doctor?

96
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,240
I'll tell you..

97
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
Please don't kill me.

98
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I will.

99
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
I'll kill you
if I don't find the doctor.

100
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,040
I'll tell you..

101
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Doctor?

102
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,440
Hello?

103
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,920
Octopus here.

104
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
I have information.

105
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sending you
the number of the source.

106
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Call him.

107
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Jai Hind!

108
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Jai Hind, sir!

109
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Good job.

110
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,640
Thank you.

111
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,040
Don't expect a medal though.

112
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,960
I won't, why will I?

113
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,480
How credible is the information?

114
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,040
We have to verify it, sir.

115
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,040
- Who is the source?
- Octopus!

116
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Is he the primary source?

117
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,840
No, secondary.

118
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,320
- Where?
- In the mountains?

119
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,880
The Centre won't agree.

120
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
I'm confident about this, sir.

121
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Have you met the source?

122
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,176
I've spoken to him over the phone.

123
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,600
Have you ever met him?

124
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
I haven't, sir.

125
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,320
Are you mad?

126
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
How can you trust him?

127
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,720
It could be a trap.

128
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,040
They could be
waiting for you there.

129
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,320
You don't even have the permission
to carry weapons there.

130
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,880
It's too risky.
Someone could die.

131
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,080
Four days are all we need, sir

132
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,040
to verify the input.

133
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,960
I have to check with the Centre.

134
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,120
I understand. I'll wait..

135
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,320
Are you crazy?

136
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
It's 15th August. A holiday!

137
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,440
I know, sir.

138
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
You're a bachelor

139
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,560
but I'm a married man.

140
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,520
I know that, sir.

141
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes, Mr. Know-it-all!

142
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Be here in an hour.

143
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Okay.

144
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
And

145
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,920
get married.

146
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,160
I will, as soon as I find someone.

147
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Why?

148
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,120
What happened to that girl
who sends you dirty messages?

149
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,280
She still does.

150
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,120
'I'm Juliet, right at the top'

151
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,080
'and you are my hot-shot cop.'

152
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
It's the latest one.

153
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,320
So, has the cop replied?

154
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,400
Does he intend to?

155
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,720
- I don't know.
- This is the problem with you guys.

156
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,480
Fearless with criminals
useless with girls.

157
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,536
Didn't you have an
arranged marriage too, sir?

158
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Hey!

159
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,720
- I'll be back in an hour.
- Okay.

160
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,920
- Jai Hind!
- Sir!

161
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,680
Where are we going, sir?

162
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,200
We can't trust them, sir.

163
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,000
These sources lie to us
all the time, for money.

164
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
It could be true.

165
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,240
Let's speak to the source directly
and find out if it's true or not.

166
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Hello?

167
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,040
It's me.

168
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
I've heard a lot
about you from Octopus.

169
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,240
I'm a simple man, sir.

170
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,920
I'm thinking of coming over.

171
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,200
It's a beautiful place,
and the weather is also good.

172
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,480
If you invite me, I'll be there.

173
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
Perhaps,
I'll get to see what you saw.

174
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Come.

175
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,320
And maybe

176
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,760
you'll get what you're after.

177
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
He seems genuine.

178
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,000
We can take a chance.

179
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
It sounds like
he has spotted someone.

180
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,240
Let's go, sir.

181
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Like I've said,
let's give it a shot.

182
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,400
I go

183
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,920
where you go.

184
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Let's do it, sir.

185
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,320
Do you know what inputs.

186
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,920
RAW, NIA, IB, State ATS

187
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,280
and Special Cell have given?

188
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,640
All of India's
most wanted criminals

189
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,840
are in Pakistan and Dubai.

190
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
It's a strong input, sir.

191
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,720
We should verify it.

192
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,120
Mr. Singh

193
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,400
if we have to
verify all the inputs that we get

194
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,080
we'll need five times
the number of people.

195
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
He's from the Operations team

196
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,640
a third-generation
intelligence officer.

197
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,480
Dedication and commitment
are second nature to him.

198
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,720
Ask him to concentrate
on local issues.

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,800
If he wants to go to the mountains,
he can go for a holiday.

200
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Jai Hind!

201
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,000
But sir..
Happy Independence day.

202
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Jai Hind!

203
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,136
The Centre has denied permission.

204
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
According to them,
they're all in Pakistan or Dubai.

205
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,000
This input
has put us in a fix, sir.

206
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,120
You taught us to give it a shot

207
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,416
even if there's
a one percent chance.

208
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,000
Prabhat, don't try that on me.

209
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,600
We should verify it, sir.

210
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,576
My instinct tells me that
it could be something big.

211
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,880
If it isn't, we'll come back.

212
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,136
But this concerns the internal
security of our country.

213
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,320
What are they talking about?

214
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,960
I'm standing right beside you.

215
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,000
What makes you think
I can hear them?

216
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,536
You'll go there
even if I tell you not to.

217
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,000
And you'll do whatever you please.

218
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,640
Is that a jab or
a piece of advice, sir?

219
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Look.

220
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
See this.

221
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,320
I got this three hours ago.

222
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,960
He was my source in the mountains.

223
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,360
Get out, quick!

224
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,400
The ISI had the local police
kill him yesterday.

225
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Do you see the slippers?

226
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,160
I sent them to him yesterday.

227
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,000
It's very risky.

228
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,120
The ISI is everywhere.

229
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,160
You don't have
any official support.

230
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,640
And your target could have
an AK-47 or even an AK-56!

231
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,960
All of you could die,
it's too dangerous.

232
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,480
Crossing the road
is also dangerous, sir.

233
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,680
You have a government vehicle

234
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,600
I can barely afford a car while
they can only afford two wheelers.

235
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,720
We can barely run our homes
with the salary we get.

236
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,560
We didn't join the IB for money.

237
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,800
We're here because we want
to do something for our country.

238
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,360
Personal safety never has
and never will be our concern.

239
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,320
So, what you're
saying is that you

240
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,880
and these four guys

241
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
will nab India's most wanted?

242
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,960
Without any weapons or support?

243
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Yes, sir.

244
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Four days.

245
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,040
You have only four days.

246
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,720
You'll go there,
verify the input and return.

247
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,320
Okay, sir.

248
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,920
Prabhat, it's election season there

249
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,280
and anti-India sentiment
is very high.

250
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,720
Anything can happen.

251
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,120
If anything happens,
forget about claiming bodies

252
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,160
their families can't even
claim their pensions.

253
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,360
Most importantly,
the IB cannot fund this operation

254
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
because the higher ups
have denied permission.

255
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,480
On paper,
this operation does not exist.

256
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,320
Understand?

257
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,280
Take this.

258
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
It's from me.

259
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,120
Don't mention this to my wife.

260
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,320
Jai Hind, sir.

261
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
All the best.

262
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,760
Keep me posted.

263
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,760
Sir, where will we get money
for the operation?

264
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,960
How much can each of you give?

265
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,040
Mr. Manish?

266
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,880
Sir, how many times will we
keep chipping-in for our missions?

267
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,400
Who are we doing this for?

268
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,240
Why don't the authorities
understand this?

269
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,960
They sit in air-conditioned
offices and issue orders.

270
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,600
They sanction millions for
Independence day celebrations

271
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,000
but scrimp when it comes
to doing something for the country.

272
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,120
Sir, we haven't been reimbursed
for the previous mission yet.

273
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,080
How can we keep chipping in?

274
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,400
Sir, I don't have any money.

275
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,680
Okay, I'll tell the boss
we're not going.

276
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,400
It's what he wanted too.

277
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Sir

278
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,200
I have 7000.

279
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,560
I have to keep 1000 in
my account or I'll be fined.

280
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,280
You can have the remaining 6000.

281
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,440
My mother takes all my money, sir.

282
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,760
I saved 4000 for a new phone.

283
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
It's okay, you can have it.

284
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,800
I have 7000.

285
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,120
I can give you 4000.

286
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,880
I have to give 3000 to my wife,
or else she'll be very angry.

287
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,320
I have 7000.

288
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
How much?

289
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
7000.

290
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Add it up.

291
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,240
26,000
including what the boss gave.

292
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,640
Okay, I'll manage the rest.

293
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Sir.

294
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,800
See you at the bus stand
in two hours.

295
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Be on time.

296
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,720
'I am the only one'

297
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,600
'who can rid this world
of infidels.'

298
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,440
'I am His soldier.'

299
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,480
'He has given me this opportunity.'

300
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,400
What is it now?

301
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,360
Don't ask for more money.

302
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,000
No, sir. We'll require
logistical support there.

303
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Yes. So?

304
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,320
Ravi Raj is the Police Head
of the bordering district.

305
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,320
He has good contacts
in the mountains.

306
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,040
And in the police.

307
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
If you allow..

308
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,960
I know he's your friend.

309
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,480
Take his help,
but don't take him along.

310
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,336
It won't matter if something
happens to you guys.

311
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,760
But if something happens to a
police officer, there'll be chaos.

312
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,480
There will be an enquiry.

313
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,360
- I'll lose my job.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,480
You are on this mission alone
and you have just four days.

315
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,480
Okay?

316
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,120
All the best and keep me posted.

317
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Jai Hind, sir!

318
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,760
Remember Mr. Marudhar?

319
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
His daughter is getting married.

320
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,360
I congratulated him
and said we'll be there.

321
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,960
We'll ask our daughter
to come as well.

322
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,560
Are you going there
for work or a holiday?

323
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,920
I would've taken both of you
with me if it was a holiday.

324
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,480
Why would I go with those guys?

325
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,456
You've been saying this
for the last three years.

326
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,320
You've been on
a 100 trips with them!

327
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,080
Where's dad going?

328
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,680
Your dad is going on a holiday.

329
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,040
4000.

330
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
4000?

331
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Again?

332
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,720
What kind of a job is this?

333
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,400
Where you have to pay them!

334
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,880
Everybody chipped in, so I had to.

335
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,136
Are you sure there's no one else?
What nonsense!

336
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,920
How can you say that, darling?

337
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,360
You're the one I love.

338
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,600
Please don't be upset.

339
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,640
Tell me, what can I get for you?
I promise I'll get it.

340
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,280
Sure!

341
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,000
Find someone else!

342
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,280
Going away? For how long?

343
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
About 4-5 days, maximum 1 week.

344
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,280
Can't we speak over the phone also?

345
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
- Hi!
- Hello.

346
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,800
I'll try my best to call you.

347
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,296
There's something I want to say.

348
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,400
What?

349
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,880
I love you.

350
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,240
I love you.

351
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,800
I miss you.

352
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,640
Take this amulet.

353
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,680
Wear it around your neck.
I will.

354
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,680
Why don't you go now?

355
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,400
Won't you introduce me
to your boss?

356
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,960
- Boss?
- Yes.

357
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Come.

358
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,680
Is she coming with us as well?

359
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,480
Sir, this is my mother.

360
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

361
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,360
My son

362
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,880
is very hard working.

363
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,680
He'll do his best in his training.

364
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,360
Okay, you leave.
They'll make sure I do.

365
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,560
- Bye.
- You should go now.

366
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,320
That vehicle has left.
You'll have to hail another one.

367
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,680
Training?

368
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,440
She doesn't even allow me
to go fishing with my friends.

369
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,480
If I say I'm after a terrorist,
she'll lock me up in a room.

370
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,640
Man!

371
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,400
- What?
- Nothing, let's go.

372
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,320
{\an8}'You are a bachelor boy
and I'm a maiden coy.'

373
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,760
She's a bold one.

374
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,760
Back in our days,
we only had landlines.

375
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,280
We didn't get a chance
to do all this.

376
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,440
Ravi sir?

377
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,360
Boss will say no.

378
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,000
He will say no
only if he finds out.

379
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,080
What?

380
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Mr. Manish, if we come along,
I can arrange for two SUVs

381
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,400
decent hotels and our meals
will also be taken care of.

382
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,720
If I bring a couple of officers,
it'll only strengthen your team.

383
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,200
And.

384
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,000
I have 40,000.

385
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,800
We can use it
if there's an emergency.

386
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,480
If you go alone,
you'll have to travel in old buses

387
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,600
stay in cheap hotels with bedbugs..

388
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,760
I get it, sir!

389
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,240
We don't need
to inform the boss, sir.

390
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,680
What we're about to do
is very dangerous.

391
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,640
I don't have a family.

392
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,080
But you do.

393
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,480
If any of you want to turn back,
now is the time.

394
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,000
- Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind!

395
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,400
What happened to
Prabhat sir's parents?

396
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,720
What do you think?

397
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,320
He has no family?

398
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,000
He was testing us.

399
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,160
You've passed the test.

400
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,200
He tests the team
before every operation.

401
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Where are you going?

402
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Kathmandu.

403
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,040
One of you
go and register yourselves.

404
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
The others step out
and get your bags checked.

405
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
What is your destination?

406
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Kathmandu.

407
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,040
Purpose of visit?

408
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
We're tourists.

409
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Check the bags.

410
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,680
How many cars and how many people?

411
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,880
Two cars and nine passengers.

412
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,680
Any women accompanying you?

413
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,720
No.

414
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,880
How long will you be there?

415
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Four days.

416
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,480
- Show me your ID.
- Sure.

417
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,800
1200.

418
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Okay.

419
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,360
You can go.

420
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,720
'It's a covert operation.'

421
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,640
'We'll act like tourists.'

422
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,120
'No weapons, no IDs.'

423
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,760
'It's a dangerous place.'

424
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,480
'We should always be alert.'

425
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,200
'Nobody should get a whiff
of our operation or who we are.'

426
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,080
'Three teams, three hotels.'

427
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,960
'Radicals, ISI, they're all here.'

428
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,280
'None of us should use
our real names.'

429
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,200
I could only arrange
for five SIMs, sir.

430
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,960
Hello?

431
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,000
It's me.

432
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,400
I've come here, like I told you.

433
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Okay.

434
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,080
Should we meet?

435
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Sir.

436
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,720
No, you say it first.

437
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,880
I'll call you back.

438
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,200
I'll call.

439
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,160
Sir, there's some
unconfirmed input from Delhi.

440
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,080
A team was denied permission
to go to Nepal.

441
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Hello?

442
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,000
Use the secure line.

443
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,480
- Yes, sir?
- Alert your people.

444
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,960
We have some information
from Delhi.

445
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,440
Javed, has anyone showed up?

446
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,840
I don't see anyone, sir.

447
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
I see a bird, sir.

448
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Tame?

449
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,000
No, it's a wild one.

450
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,120
I see another one.

451
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,080
This one's wild as well.

452
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,960
He's tying his shoelaces.

453
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
He's tame.

454
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,320
He'll return.

455
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,040
He's turning back.

456
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,120
He'll stop.

457
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,080
He stopped.

458
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,200
Wait for 10 minutes.

459
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,440
Check his body language.

460
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,080
See if there's anyone with him.

461
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,680
He'll be close by, following him.

462
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,080
See if it's a trap.

463
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,160
He seems relaxed, sir.

464
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,480
He's not looking around nervously.

465
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,920
Movement negative,
he seems genuine.

466
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,760
Wait for another five minutes.

467
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,720
Why so many checks?

468
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Not checks, these are precautions.

469
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,280
All clear?

470
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Clear.

471
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,520
Clear.

472
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
Clear.

473
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,440
Hello?

474
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,080
Sorry, I got delayed.

475
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,760
This lake is huge.

476
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,960
I came in from the wrong gate.

477
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,640
I'm standing in front of
Hotel Fewa.

478
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,200
Can you come here, please?

479
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,280
Wait there.

480
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Okay.

481
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,040
Watch him.

482
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,256
There might be someone tailing him.

483
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,680
He'll be close by, following him.

484
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,200
I don't see anyone near him.

485
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,200
I don't think
there's anyone with him.

486
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,200
I'm right behind.

487
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
I have eyes on him.

488
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,720
It's a nice place.

489
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
The weather is also good.

490
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,240
Both of them are talking.

491
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,680
They're going somewhere.

492
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,240
They should've stayed here
and talked.

493
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,480
They're entering a lane.

494
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,160
You should come,
I'm following them.

495
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,720
It's right this way, come.

496
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,080
Please come.

497
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Please come.

498
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,360
Which lane are they in?

499
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
I can't see them.

500
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,280
These lanes are like a maze.

501
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Tea?

502
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,120
I don't drink tea, coffee or sodas.

503
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,200
How did you get here?

504
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,960
Took the bus.

505
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Are you alone or

506
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,280
is there someone with you?

507
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
I have some people.

508
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,816
I'm covering the area
beside the lake.

509
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,760
Where are you, Mr. Manish?

510
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,360
I'm covering the area
near the road.

511
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,680
Have you booked a hotel?

512
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,160
I've made arrangements.

513
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,920
You don't need to worry.

514
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,920
What do I get from this?

515
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,200
What you get

516
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,440
depends on the target

517
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
and on your cooperation.

518
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,000
You stand to gain

519
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,920
or lose.

520
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,080
See you tomorrow.

521
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
Where?

522
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
I've saved your number
as 'Friend' on my phone.

523
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,120
You are a friend, right?

524
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,040
Where were the shots fired from?

525
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Shots?

526
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Where?

527
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,720
Find out
where the shots were fired.

528
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,880
Run, Javed!

529
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,720
Go and check it out!

530
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,080
'They have brought this
destruction upon themselves.'

531
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,680
'We had invited all
infidels to join us.'

532
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,280
'But they did not listen'

533
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,960
'this blast was the only way
I could get them to.'

534
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,760
This is your 50% advance.

535
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,680
He looked like one of the men

536
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,960
in the five photographs
that Octopus had shown.

537
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Where did you see him?

538
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,240
He came to my shop.

539
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,680
Alone?

540
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,920
There was someone with him.

541
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,680
What is that man's name?

542
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Nadeem.

543
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,720
Why had he come?

544
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,360
You know I do some work
for Eastern Union.

545
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,400
No point hiding this from you.

546
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,640
I do a bit of
money laundering as well.

547
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,920
He was offering me 20%

548
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,280
to send money to Hyderabad.

549
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
20%!

550
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,920
He gave me 500,000.

551
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,680
I had to transfer only 400,000.

552
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,080
I agreed at once!

553
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,080
20% is a lot, sir.

554
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,120
That's what made me suspicious.

555
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,880
I asked a few questions.

556
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
What kind of questions?

557
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720
What did he look like?

558
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,680
He had a long beard.

559
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
He was fair.

560
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
He sounded like someone
from Kashmir.

561
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
And?

562
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,640
He said he's from Delhi.

563
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,640
His father lives in Dubai.

564
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,760
And that he's a doctor
of alternative medicine.

565
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,920
Which one of these is him?

566
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,040
Don't be scared.

567
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,280
Take your time.

568
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,840
Take another look.
You've seen him.

569
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,040
Actually

570
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,080
he had a long beard.

571
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,080
Forget the beard
and focus on the eyes.

572
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,240
These are the photographs
that Octopus had.

573
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,880
They're the same ones.

574
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,440
Sir, I think

575
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,080
I recognise the eyes
of one of them.

576
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,680
Can I take another look?

577
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,080
If I remove the beard, then..

578
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,120
I'm 70% sure that it's this man.

579
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,440
Let's inform the boss, sir.

580
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
No.

581
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,440
Not until we're a 100% sure.

582
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,400
But how can we be certain?

583
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,096
He says that man is from Kashmir,
whereas Yusuf hails from Karnataka.

584
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,120
That..

585
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
That's why.

586
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,960
We need to be a 100% sure.

587
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,680
Do you have CCTV cameras
in your office?

588
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
No, sir.

589
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,200
What about the neighbouring shops?

590
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
They don't either.

591
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,400
Has he ever received
money from somewhere?

592
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,840
Once, from Dubai.

593
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,640
Which document did he submit?

594
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,240
It'll have his photograph.

595
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,480
I don't remember, sir.

596
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,440
This happened six months ago.

597
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,160
You know how easily
these documents get misplaced.

598
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
Let us..

599
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,200
Hello, have the children arrived?

600
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,560
I can't hear anything.

601
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,400
Call me later.

602
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,080
The children who were to arrive,
are they here?

603
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,760
Can I talk to you later?
I can't hear anything.

604
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,440
I couldn't hear
what he was saying, sir.

605
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,000
Sir, the voice was very clear.

606
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,376
Are we the 'children'
he was referring to?

607
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,480
Is he double-crossing us

608
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,960
and taking money from us and them?

609
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,280
If the other phone had not rung

610
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,920
we wouldn't know
that he has two phones.

611
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,680
Sir, he's a double agent.

612
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Where can I find him?

613
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,560
I don't know, sir.

614
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,160
Who would?

615
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,640
Nadeem might know.

616
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,720
How do you know this Nadeem guy?

617
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,880
He visits me occasionally.

618
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,160
If he brings me business.

619
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,200
I give him a small commission.

620
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,160
So, he'll come if you call him?

621
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,720
I've never called him.

622
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,960
He comes whenever
he needs to make a buck.

623
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,880
He visited me 15 days ago.

624
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Okay.

625
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,640
Why?

626
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,560
A client wanted to send money
to Saudi Arabia.

627
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,960
But sir, I don't have
any contacts in Saudi Arabia.

628
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,960
I'm sure you have his number.

629
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,920
I do.

630
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
But

631
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,120
I've never called him.

632
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,560
You will, today.

633
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,240
'The mobile you have dialled'

634
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,840
'is switched off.'

635
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,280
Try again.

636
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,240
'The mobile you have dialled..'

637
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,320
It's switched off, sir.

638
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,840
Do you remember anything else?

639
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,240
'To bring fear into
the hearts of the infidels'

640
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,800
'is our only aim.'

641
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,920
'As we punish the infidels'

642
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,720
'it is their suffering'

643
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,960
'that brings us peace.'

644
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,800
I think we should
wait for Nadeem to call.

645
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,840
Sir, we don't have time to wait.

646
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,440
Failure is not an option for us.

647
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,176
I have a feeling
he's hiding somewhere close by.

648
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,400
We just need to find Yusuf.

649
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,640
Look at this photograph
a hundred times if required.

650
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,800
Look closely at the eyes.

651
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,200
Railway stations, bus stands,
highways

652
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,160
hourly motels, dance bars..

653
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,840
Keep an eye on these places.

654
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,640
These people hide in places
from where they can escape easily.

655
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,840
How much for two scooters?

656
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,960
Hourly motels?

657
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,120
Couples can book
a room by the hour here.

658
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,880
A change of sheets
and it's ready again.

659
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,760
It's very expensive, sir.

660
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,280
One beer, two glasses.

661
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,600
Drink at home the next time!

662
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Three cups of tea.

663
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,320
They've gone to Kathmandu.

664
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Two days ago.

665
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,560
Nine of them, two SUVs.

666
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,240
Said they were tourists.

667
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,680
They could be.

668
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,200
I've been working here
for 20 years.

669
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,160
A group of nine tourists, only men

670
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,880
can either be cops or criminals.

671
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,440
You would know.

672
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280
Sir!

673
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,280
Sir!

674
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,480
- Sir?
- What's wrong, sir?

675
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,240
- Sir?
- What's wrong, Prabhat?

676
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,640
Get some water!
Call Friend. Are you okay?

677
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,920
Drink some water.

678
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,840
'The mobile you have dialled'

679
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,720
'is switched off.'

680
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,480
- Switched off, sir.
- Try again.

681
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Sit down.

682
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,120
'Sorry, the mobile you
have dialled'

683
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,640
'is switched off.'

684
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,840
It's switched off, sir.

685
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,240
What happened, sir?

686
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,040
Three cups of tea.

687
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,840
It's so hot today.

688
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,920
He looks suspicious.

689
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,280
The tea is good, isn't it?

690
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,080
Do you have any idea
who those guys were?

691
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,880
They could be radicals, ISI..

692
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,880
What if Friend is
their friend as well?

693
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,200
This is not a coincidence.

694
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,800
Why don't you try
calling him again?

695
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,760
Ravi, how could we get it so wrong?

696
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,800
'The mobile you have
dialled is switched off.'

697
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,920
It's switched off, sir.

698
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,560
Try again.

699
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,960
'The mobile you have
dialled is switched off.'

700
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,640
'Sorry, the mobile you
have dialled'

701
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,200
'is switched off.'

702
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,440
'Sorry, the mobile you
have dialled is switched off.'

703
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,760
'Sorry, the mobile you
have dialled'

704
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,280
'is switched off.'

705
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,600
'Sorry, the mobile you
have dialled'

706
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,560
'is switched off.'

707
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:23,400
'Sorry, the mobile you
have dialled'

708
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,280
'is switched off.'

709
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,880
'Sorry, the mobile you
have dialled is switched off.'

710
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,960
Hey!

711
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,920
Who the hell are you guys?

712
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,856
What are you doing in Nepal?

713
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,600
- Tourists!
- Tourist?

714
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,976
It's the truth!
Do you think we're fools

715
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,560
to believe you're tourists?

716
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,880
Believe me, we are tourists!

717
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,600
- Our company ID.
- Company ID?

718
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,960
Who is this guy then?

719
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,080
Told you he's double crossing us!

720
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,280
Bittu!

721
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,960
Good morning.

722
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,200
Good morning? You're
double crossing us, you rascal!

723
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,760
Do you think we're fools?

724
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,240
Why was your phone switched off?

725
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,680
Do you think we're here alone?

726
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,200
You aren't the only ones
in danger here.

727
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,080
The information that I gave
puts my life at risk as well!

728
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,720
They'll come, slit my throat

729
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,400
and leave me to die

730
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,920
writhing in pain.

731
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,720
That's why I have to be careful.

732
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,040
I need to keep my phone
switched off.

733
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,840
You'll leave after a few days,
but I have to live here.

734
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,080
Nadeem had called me.

735
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,960
He said

736
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,200
the doctor has gone to
collect herbs in the jungle.

737
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,760
I told him I'll be
in his neighbourhood tomorrow.

738
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,960
I need to meet you
about the Saudi Arabia job.

739
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,440
What did he say?

740
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,560
He asked me to call after I reach.

741
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,600
Where does he stay?

742
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,720
In a village, 15 kilometres away.

743
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,360
What do you think, Prabhat?

744
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,320
I think Nadeem is the handler.

745
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,200
In that case

746
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,000
he's staying somewhere
close to his house.

747
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,920
Where did he ask to meet you?

748
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,560
At the village square.

749
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,200
Oregaon square.

750
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,560
You were followed,
do you still trust him?

751
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,400
He could be lying, sir.

752
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,720
We only have one more day.

753
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,480
'Javed.'

754
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,480
'Bittu.'

755
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,480
'The two of you will
reach the square early'

756
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,400
'wait for us there
and keep a lookout.'

757
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,840
'Don't take chances.'

758
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,840
'We'll drop him off
two stops away.'

759
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,200
'He'll take the bus from there
and reach Oregaon square.'

760
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,560
'We'll pick him up from there.'

761
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,080
Why did he get off here?

762
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,840
Come on..

763
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,376
Wasn't he supposed to
get off at the second stop?

764
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,120
Yes.
He got off at the first one.

765
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,400
At the first stop?

766
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,840
Something's wrong.
What's going on now?

767
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,560
He's standing at the bus stop.

768
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,840
Something's off,
I told you he's double crossing us.

769
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,960
Don't panic.

770
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,680
Stay at a distance and wait.

771
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,280
A bike stopped
in front of him, sir.

772
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,280
What does the biker look like?

773
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,480
He's wearing a helmet.

774
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,040
Our guy is leaving
with him on the bike.

775
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,200
Follow them.

776
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,880
Fast. Fast.

777
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,560
Fast!
Go slow and keep a distance.

778
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,720
Sir.

779
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Stop. Stop.

780
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,320
He got off at the second stop.

781
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,440
The biker has left.
He got off at the second stop.

782
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,160
Okay, keep a distance.

783
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,160
He's waiting.

784
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,200
A man approached him.
They're shaking hands.

785
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,280
Nadeem.. That must be Nadeem.

786
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,360
They're walking
towards the square now.

787
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,656
- Follow them on foot.
- Yes, sir.

788
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,680
Not you.

789
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,800
Tell Pillai.

790
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,920
- Friend knows you.
- Give that!

791
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,720
Listen to me carefully, Javed.

792
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,976
The package is headed
towards the square.

793
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,960
Don't do anything,
wait for my instructions.

794
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,600
Just observe and follow.

795
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,800
The package is headed here.

796
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,960
We have to follow.

797
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,240
You take the delivery.

798
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,040
I'll take care
of any extra luggage.

799
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,720
Javed, take over.

800
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,760
- Hello!
- Sir, the package has reached the warehouse.

801
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,880
Wait for my instructions.

802
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,280
The same eyes.

803
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,480
What're you looking at, sir?

804
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,120
Ghost.

805
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,000
Our most wanted.

806
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,280
Welcome to the United States.

807
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,720
Next.

808
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,760
{\an8}Mr. Khan,
remove your glasses please.

809
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,120
What's the purpose of
your visit to United States?

810
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,640
{\an8}Once again, the country's
biggest superstar.

811
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:11,320
{\an8}Shah Rukh Khan was detained
at New York Airport

812
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,640
{\an8}and questioned for over an hour!

813
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,120
{\an8}Shah Rukh Khan was there
to participate

814
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,280
{\an8}at an event at Yale University.

815
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,040
{\an8}Shah Rukh Khan had been detained
in a similar fashion, back in 2009.

816
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,960
Sir!

817
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,776
There are nine of them, sir.

818
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,680
In SUVs.

819
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,840
They claim to be tourists.

820
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,760
They're in Kathmandu.

821
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,720
If the team is here,
it's these guys.

822
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,080
You may..

823
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,760
Get all the agents active.

824
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,200
Put all our trained guys
there on alert, ready for action.

825
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,976
I'll get more details
from Delhi in the meanwhile.

826
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Okay, sir.

827
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,040
Look for these two SUVs.

828
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,760
Go.

829
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,720
Sir, he has left.

830
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,720
He's standing at the bus stop.

831
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,120
He's in the bus.

832
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,120
Give this to the spotters.

833
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,600
We need to find two SUVs.

834
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,400
Call me when you spot them.

835
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,120
Prabhat..

836
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,280
Get out!

837
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,880
You were supposed to
get off at the second stop!

838
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,616
Why did you get off
at the first stop?

839
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,640
Tell me!

840
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,480
Nadeem called me.

841
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,560
Hello?

842
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,920
Get off one stop early.

843
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,400
Someone will pick you up on a bike.

844
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,280
I'll meet you at the next stop.

845
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,040
He came and asked me
to come home with him.

846
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,960
The doctor has returned.

847
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,680
Weren't you complaining
of a stomach ache?

848
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,200
He's the one who wanted
the Saudi Arabia job done.

849
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,480
That doctor arrived
half an hour later.

850
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,320
Peace be upon you.

851
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,200
And unto you peace.

852
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,720
Tell me, what's the problem?

853
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,920
It's him, sir.

854
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,000
The man in the photograph.

855
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,280
It's him!

856
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,000
What about the two things
I had told you?

857
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,640
Yes, his hairline starts from here.

858
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,960
His teeth protrude, like this.

859
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,760
And the third?

860
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,040
So, you have a stomach ache.

861
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,800
For how long?

862
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,120
What did you eat?

863
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,720
'Assalaam-alaikum.'

864
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,160
'Walaikum assalaam.'

865
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,640
Play it again.

866
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,720
'Assalaam-alaikum.'

867
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,600
'Walaikum assalaam.'

868
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,680
'Tell me, what's the problem?'

869
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,680
'So, you have a stomach ache.'

870
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,120
'For how long?'

871
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,720
'What did you eat?'

872
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,600
'Assalaam-alaikum.'

873
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,920
I think he's from Karnataka, sir.

874
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,120
He's definitely from South India.

875
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,960
Come here, quick! We need
to find two SUVs right away.

876
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,336
Call me as soon as you spot them.

877
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,800
BR-2H-2173.

878
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,640
BR-01-BB-0181.

879
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,880
Get this job done quickly.
Hurry up!

880
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,080
Where have you been
for the last three days?

881
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,080
Tomorrow is your
last day there. That's..

882
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,640
Sir, we've identified the target.

883
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,720
What?

884
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,080
- Who?
- Ghost.

885
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,240
- What!
- Our Osama Bin Laden.

886
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,560
Yusuf?

887
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,656
The man we've been after,
for the last seven years?

888
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,680
Yes, sir.

889
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,720
Are you sure it's him?

890
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,080
He's here, claims to be
a doctor of alternative medicine.

891
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,520
Dr. Imran.

892
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,240
He says he's from Delhi

893
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,000
and his parents live in Dubai.

894
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,160
Key features, height,
colour, family details, all match.

895
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,040
We've recorded his voice sample.

896
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,000
He has a South Indian accent.

897
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,440
I'm 90% sure it's him.

898
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,880
Tell the Centre we need backup.

899
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,360
We need to act fast.

900
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,040
We can't risk it.
This is our chance.

901
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,360
Ravi is here, he'll verify.

902
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,720
Are you mad!

903
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,720
What is he doing there?

904
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,160
I told you not to take him along.

905
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,960
I'll lose my job. Jai Hind, sir.

906
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,720
I have pledged my life
to the country too, sir.

907
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,520
Are you sure it's him?

908
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,920
Sir, we're 90% sure.

909
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,000
But we need to act fast.

910
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,480
Give the phone to Prabhat. Sir.

911
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,360
- Yes, sir?
- Wait for my call.

912
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,800
The team was denied permission.

913
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,640
So, where's the problem?

914
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,960
It's the team leader.

915
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:16,960
Why is he a problem?

916
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,600
He has a habit of
not following orders.

917
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,040
The actual problem is that

918
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,200
he has carried out many successful
missions, without permission.

919
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,320
- Hello?
- Jai Hind, sir.

920
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,720
Jai Hind.

921
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,320
Sir, we've identified
a target in Nepal.

922
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,240
Who sent a team to Nepal?

923
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,320
I had told you not to.

924
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,240
It seemed like a high-value target,
someone from our most wanted list.

925
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,320
It was worth the risk.

926
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,000
Who is your high-value target?

927
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,400
90% Yusuf, sir.

928
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,840
Most features and
characteristics are a match.

929
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,040
We must act soon.

930
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,240
90%?

931
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,000
There's a 10% chance
that you're wrong.

932
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,640
Every operation has
a minor risk involved, sir.

933
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,120
Not in a foreign country.

934
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,160
Not in Nepal.

935
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,880
You know how important
Nepal is for us.

936
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,680
Sir, I have faith in my team.

937
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,360
And I have faith in the memos
that have been circulated here.

938
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,160
All the agencies have verified
that Yusuf, Riyaz, Iqbal

939
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,720
are either in Pakistan or Dubai.

940
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,960
Sir, we are making a mistake.
Not we

941
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,640
you have made a mistake!

942
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,120
You sent a team against my orders.

943
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,680
Not following orders can lead to
an enquiry, you know the protocol.

944
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,120
My team has no backup there.

945
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,760
They have no weapons or IDs

946
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,536
nor do they have
any logistic support.

947
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,200
If we don't send backup,
their lives will be at risk.

948
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,240
You should've thought
of this earlier, Mr. Singh.

949
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,720
Sir, please listen..
The Centre will not send any backup.

950
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,840
Jai Hind.

951
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,200
Elections will be
held in India next year.

952
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,880
We've trained the boys
and spent millions.

953
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,880
We have a lot of things
planned for various cities.

954
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,040
We cannot risk it.

955
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,800
We do a lot of things
without permission too.

956
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,976
If they're here,
we need to know who they are

957
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,560
where they are
and why they're here.

958
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,680
Find out from the handlers
if our boys are safe.

959
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,120
Yes, sir.

960
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,576
Prabhat,
the Centre won't send any backup.

961
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,920
The people may not be aware,
but RAW, IB, NIA, Special Cell

962
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,216
we all know that this man is 10
times more dangerous than Dawood.

963
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,736
For seven years, the Centre has
identified him as our No.1 target.

964
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,936
How many more blasts or
innocent lives must be lost, sir?

965
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,680
This is our chance to nab him.

966
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,640
He's India's most wanted, sir.

967
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,360
Prabhat, we have our limitations.

968
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,720
We have to follow rules.

969
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,080
I tried my best.

970
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,440
If we go by the book,
we won't even catch a rat.

971
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,720
You tell me, are rules
more important than the country?

972
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,160
Sir, we're this close
to capturing him.

973
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,640
If I lose this chance,
we may never be able to nab him.

974
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,160
You and I both know
how dangerous he is.

975
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,336
He can kill
many more innocent people.

976
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,160
I did try, Prabhat.

977
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,600
At times I feel our
country has more to fear

978
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,560
from the people at the Centre
than terrorists like Yusuf.

979
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,320
'I have been ordered
to carry on with this war'

980
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:13,080
'till everyone agrees that
our faith is the only one.'

981
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,560
None of us have seen his face.

982
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,000
How can we be sure that it's Yusuf,
just by looking at his eyes?

983
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,000
What if he really
is in Pakistan or Dubai?

984
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,720
Mr. Manish, can't you be
positive sometimes at least?

985
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,400
We've come here to catch him, sir,
not let him go.

986
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,256
If we can't capture him
and there's another blast

987
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,960
or innocent lives lost,
I'll never forgive myself.

988
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,336
I won't be able to
come to terms with the fact

989
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,200
that we let him go when
we could've caught him.

990
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,560
No matter what,
we'll take him back with us.

991
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,096
I don't care if I
lose my job or my life.

992
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,120
I knew it!

993
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,120
You and your habit
of not following orders!

994
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,200
Sir, you've taught us

995
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,816
we should give it a shot
even if there's a 1% chance.

996
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,016
And here we have a 90% chance.

997
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,040
I'll reiterate

998
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,600
we should give it a shot
even if there's a 1% chance.

999
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,840
And I know you'll do
whatever you want.

1000
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,600
It concerns innocent civilians,
our country, sir!

1001
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,200
Then why bother asking me?

1002
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,840
Just going by the book, sir.

1003
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,320
If we go by the book..

1004
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,080
We won't even catch a rat.

1005
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:39,960
Jai Hind.

1006
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,936
Now that we're here,
we'll take him back with us.

1007
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,360
We'll kidnap him if required.

1008
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,720
Consequences be damned!

1009
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,040
- Bittu, Javed.
- Yes, sir.

1010
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,200
Keep an eye on the house.

1011
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,656
Keep a watch on who
is coming and going.

1012
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,880
Follow him if he leaves the house.

1013
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,840
Always keep him in your sight.

1014
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,456
Pay attention
to every minute detail.

1015
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,920
We have only one chance
to catch him.

1016
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,080
We may never get another chance.

1017
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,240
- Any questions?
- No, sir!

1018
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,840
Search everywhere,
all hotels and guesthouses.

1019
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,880
Get the other boys to look all over.
Yes, ma'am.

1020
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,880
The boys are searching all over.

1021
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,920
Get more boys if required.

1022
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,536
Who else was there in the house?

1023
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,920
I saw two children in the room.

1024
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,640
The scoundrel is training new boys.

1025
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,000
What else did you see in the room?

1026
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,440
There was a computer
on a table in the corner.

1027
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Anything else?

1028
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,120
A large cupboard
with a big lock on it.

1029
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,400
Weapons!

1030
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,840
Explosives!

1031
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,216
We are searching for them, sir.

1032
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,000
My boys are everywhere.

1033
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,360
Our team is ready grab him.

1034
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,240
This is our best chance
and the closest

1035
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,080
we've come to getting
our most wanted man.

1036
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,280
Why come to me?

1037
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,840
Biswas is your boss.

1038
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,176
He didn't give us permission, sir.

1039
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,456
He asked me to get the team back.

1040
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,600
Said that they are
in Pakistan and Dubai.

1041
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,360
Maybe he is right.
Maybe he is wrong.

1042
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,616
Sir, the team won't return
without completing the operation.

1043
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,120
Kanu Master, Haider Ali, Sunil Lobo.

1044
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,480
Prabhat has caught them all.

1045
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,680
This team has never
returned empty-handed.

1046
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,896
That's why
I have full faith in them.

1047
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,440
Sir, please listen to me.

1048
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,280
You're an operations man.

1049
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,440
You know that ground
reality is very different.

1050
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,600
We can never be 100% sure.

1051
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,080
They've risked their lives.

1052
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,840
We cannot leave them
out there in the cold.

1053
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,320
They've put their lives
and careers at stake.

1054
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,760
One of them just got married.

1055
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,320
They have children, families..

1056
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,856
They've left everything
behind for the mission.

1057
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,680
Why? They must be on to something.

1058
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,480
You know that despite
being given incentives

1059
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,760
no one wants to go
for these risky operations.

1060
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,400
These men have volunteered
to do so.

1061
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,360
That too, at their own expense.

1062
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,880
What is the probability?

1063
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,000
It's high, sir.

1064
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,640
Why else would I be here?

1065
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,720
Search every nook and corner.

1066
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,720
Every lane. You go that way.

1067
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,120
Bir Singh, we need your help.

1068
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,640
Look

1069
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,040
we are not allowed to.

1070
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,240
It's too risky.

1071
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,560
You know our situation.

1072
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,320
We aren't allowed
to carry weapons here.

1073
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,200
He's a dangerous criminal.

1074
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,840
We have to take him with us.

1075
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,560
That's why
we're requesting you, sir.

1076
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,840
He's a cop,
do you think he'll help?

1077
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,000
I've helped him many times,
he should.

1078
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,320
Sir, our men are everywhere.

1079
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,000
We don't have any information yet.

1080
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,080
Ravi, pull over.

1081
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,920
Hello?

1082
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,080
They know that your team
is in Nepal.

1083
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,400
What happened?

1084
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,000
The ISI knows that
we're here in Nepal.

1085
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,080
What?

1086
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,120
Sir.

1087
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,600
Good news.

1088
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,016
The embassy will send
a team tomorrow.

1089
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,480
Sir, things have changed here.

1090
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,160
What do you mean?
The ISI knows we're here in Nepal.

1091
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,440
I want you to pull back.
Your lives are in danger.

1092
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,776
I'll arrange for a team tomorrow.

1093
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,320
We can't wait till tomorrow, sir.

1094
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,080
Our personal safety
is not a concern

1095
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,920
that man is a national threat.

1096
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,400
We have to take this risk.

1097
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,560
Listen to me, Prabhat,
your lives are in danger.

1098
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,280
Prabhat..

1099
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,840
They were never in Kathmandu.

1100
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:11,920
They weren't?

1101
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,360
Think like them.

1102
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,960
If you were on a mission

1103
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,640
would you tell anyone
where you're going?

1104
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,760
Probably not.

1105
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,160
Definitely not.

1106
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,440
Kathmandu was a diversion.

1107
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,880
They were never here.
Where could they have gone?

1108
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:42,240
Some other town.

1109
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:45,440
Search all the places
where we have our boys.

1110
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,760
Yes, sir!

1111
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,360
Get more men if required.

1112
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,600
Get information from anywhere.

1113
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,280
I don't care, I want results.

1114
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,920
Sir, they don't have much time.

1115
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,680
Please, sir.

1116
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,120
Hello?
The embassy is sending a team.

1117
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,440
I'm sending you the contact
details of Mr. Narang.

1118
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,320
Sir..

1119
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,240
What?

1120
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,600
I'm nervous.

1121
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,120
So am I.

1122
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,480
I hope you've got the right man.

1123
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,080
All the best.

1124
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,160
Everything is ready, sir.

1125
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,160
Prabhat Kumar?

1126
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,440
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1127
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,400
Just three of them, sir?

1128
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,240
I thought there would be more men.

1129
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,680
Stop!

1130
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,640
Sir, haven't seen him
since we've come here.

1131
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,240
So, which house is it?

1132
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,240
That one, sir.

1133
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,440
I don't see anyone inside.

1134
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:50,600
Why do you Indians
always trouble us Nepalis?

1135
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,560
The target
is inside the house, sir.

1136
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,440
He claims to be a doctor.

1137
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,240
We have to go in saying
we have a patient with us.

1138
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,960
We know what to do.

1139
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,760
You guys will stay at a distance.

1140
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,480
No one will go near the house.

1141
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,360
Only we will go inside.

1142
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,176
What do you mean
stay at a distance?

1143
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,840
I mean we'll decide
when to go inside.

1144
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,880
They're staring at
the house like fools.

1145
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,600
Sir, why aren't they going inside?

1146
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,840
Are they here to catch them
or help them escape?

1147
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,720
He hasn't been spotted
since morning.

1148
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,720
Could he have left?

1149
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,600
We can't take a chance.

1150
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,480
In the next five minutes, we'll
cover all the exits of the house.

1151
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,480
Sir.

1152
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:46,560
Form an outer ring.

1153
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:51,560
We'll need to handle that fool.
I can handle him alone.

1154
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,120
He was looking at me,
I caught him by the collar.

1155
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,160
Is there a problem?

1156
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,360
I told you,
we'll decide when to go in.

1157
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:10,800
The target is inside, sir.

1158
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,240
My team is also ready.

1159
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,800
We might face a problem
if you delay going inside.

1160
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,616
Both of us will have
to bear the consequences.

1161
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,640
Really?

1162
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,760
Are you threatening us?

1163
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,880
I'm simply asking you
to do what you're here for.

1164
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,080
Sir..

1165
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,120
Why aren't they going in?

1166
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,600
I don't trust these guys.

1167
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,760
What if they mess up?

1168
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,360
Sir, Pokhara.

1169
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,280
Yusuf!

1170
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,120
Open fire if you need to!
Kill those bloody dogs!

1171
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,280
We'll handle Nepal later. Okay.

1172
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,040
They know your location.

1173
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,960
Why isn't Yusuf
answering the phone?

1174
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,200
He's disconnecting the call.

1175
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,400
It's been 15 minutes already, sir.

1176
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,960
They should've been out by now.

1177
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,800
Something's not right, sir.

1178
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,760
Yes, tell me.

1179
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,320
Hello?

1180
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,480
Who told you that
he's our most wanted man?

1181
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,480
Bullshit!

1182
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,840
You guys are wrong.

1183
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,600
You've got the wrong information.

1184
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,200
They have entered the wrong house.

1185
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,080
This is a bloody blunder.

1186
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,160
They are furious

1187
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,400
threatening to escalate this
to the Prime Minister.

1188
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,640
Dinesh, how could
you be so wrong, man?

1189
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,480
He's a turbine engineer,
not a doctor!

1190
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,560
He has books and ID cards
to prove it!

1191
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,960
And who is on this team?
Sack them immediately.

1192
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,840
And you know how many strings I
had to pull to get this thing done?

1193
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,040
And now this is really
very embarrassing.

1194
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,640
Dinesh, this is over.
Right now! Call them back!

1195
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,040
Immediately, okay?

1196
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,480
Soumik was right.

1197
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,120
I shouldn't have listened to you.

1198
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:03,600
Now I'm going to lose my job too.

1199
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:13,360
Sir! - This is the first time
in my 25 year career

1200
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,480
that I've been so ashamed.

1201
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,840
Pack your bags
and leave right away!

1202
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:23,760
Sir..

1203
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:31,920
Sir?

1204
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,080
What's wrong, sir?

1205
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,200
They're gone.

1206
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,440
They've left their bags behind.

1207
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,280
- Hello?
- Sir, there's something I wanted to ask you.

1208
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:36,800
How does a doctor become
a turbine engineer in a day?

1209
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,480
What nonsense is this?

1210
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,240
You're the one
talking nonsense, sir.

1211
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,240
How did you become an IPS officer?

1212
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,720
What did you say?

1213
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,400
How did you become an IPS officer?

1214
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,360
You're crossing the line, okay!

1215
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,760
I know I am,
because I want to know.

1216
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,720
How did a doctor become
an engineer in a day?

1217
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,480
You're in the IPS, use your brains!

1218
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,240
Sir, it's his cover.

1219
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,760
New names,
new professions in new locations.

1220
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,400
Who knows
how many aliases he's used.

1221
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,320
Who told you that
he's a turbine engineer?

1222
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,720
The Nepal team.

1223
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,400
And you believed them?

1224
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:14,960
You'll believe them but not us?

1225
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,880
Sir, that team is not
capable of nabbing this man.

1226
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,080
I have a team waiting outside.

1227
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,760
Ask them to bring him
out of the house.

1228
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,560
If he's not our target,
we'll let him go.

1229
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:26,640
Impossible!

1230
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,040
I can't do anything about it, okay!

1231
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,560
Sir, use all the contacts
that you need to

1232
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,560
and get him out in five minutes.

1233
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,240
I want to see him.

1234
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,480
If he's not out in five minutes..

1235
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,280
We've come 500 kilometres
to get this man.

1236
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,680
No one can stop us from
going these last 50 meters.

1237
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,360
I don't care
if we go to jail or die.

1238
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,200
What!

1239
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,960
He is a mad man!

1240
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:21,640
Sir?

1241
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,480
His five minutes are up.

1242
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,480
Idiots!

1243
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,480
I told you not to come inside!

1244
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,600
And I told you that
we'll take him with us.

1245
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:01,280
I also told you that
this is Nepal, not India.

1246
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,320
Take one more step
and I'll shoot you.

1247
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,760
One?

1248
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,760
I'll take as many steps as I need,
to get to him.

1249
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,920
Go ahead and fire
as many bullets as you want.

1250
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,920
Sir.

1251
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,360
Nepal Embassy, New Delhi.

1252
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,480
What!

1253
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,600
What?

1254
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,480
- Your..
- I know, sir.

1255
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,440
He's crazy

1256
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,840
about our country.

1257
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:02,080
Like all of us should be.

1258
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,560
Isn't it?

1259
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,600
- Take him!
- Come on!

1260
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:12,680
Hey!

1261
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:15,920
Come on!

1262
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,240
The soul does not perish,
it is the body that dies.

1263
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:40,280
I am not killing people.

1264
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,480
I'm sending their souls
into new bodies.

1265
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,240
Anyone who kills
an innocent human being

1266
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,360
is guilty of killing humanity.

1267
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,760
Anyone who saves a single life

1268
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,640
saves humanity.

1269
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:26,840
Throw this scoundrel
inside the car!

1270
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:35,896
Prabhat, hurry up,
we need to cross the border.

1271
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:36,920
It's very dangerous.

1272
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,960
Tell me.
Eagle has got the target, sir.

1273
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:49,760
Eagle is flying towards the nest.

1274
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:52,080
The flight might be easy,
but reaching the nest won't.

1275
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,160
To believe in the Ghost

1276
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,200
we have to see the Ghost first
and then punish him.

1277
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,280
Don't waste time,
leave for the border immediately.

1278
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,680
Okay, sir. Jai Hind!

1279
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,080
Who was it?

1280
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,680
The mad man.

1281
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,600
There is no one here, sir.

1282
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:45,840
Damn it!

1283
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:55,856
Who the hell is this other guy?

1284
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,160
Sir, he won't say.

1285
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:01,536
- What's wrong, Prabhat?
- Sir..

1286
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,920
We need to hurry, it's dangerous!
Get him out!

1287
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:07,280
Let's lose this guy.
We've got what we want.

1288
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,360
Prabhat..
Let's kill him right here.

1289
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,840
Bring him here.

1290
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,440
We can't waste time, Prabhat.

1291
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:13,880
Javed, where's the parcel?

1292
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,280
Bittu, get the parcel!

1293
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,920
- Hurry up!
- No, sir!

1294
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,440
I'll tell you everything!

1295
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,360
I'm Faizullah Akhtar

1296
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:21,880
alias Maachis! I'm Maachis, sir!

1297
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,560
I had escaped from Batla House.

1298
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,600
A happy hour deal!

1299
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,000
Buy one get one free!

1300
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,080
Nab Osama and get Al Jawahari free!

1301
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,360
Prabhat, let's hurry.
We need to cross the border.

1302
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:33,840
Sir..

1303
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,800
They shouldn't cross the border.

1304
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,960
This is the remaining 50%.

1305
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,400
I don't usually compromise
when it comes to business.

1306
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:48,800
But I'll give you a 50% discount
for this 100% terrorist.

1307
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:14,240
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

1308
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,560
Who did we capture?

1309
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:04,600
The entire army is here
to receive him.

1310
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,640
Sir, I'd rather die

1311
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,240
before I let you
or the nation down.

1312
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:35,216
Do you plan to come to India

1313
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:37,521
or will you keep blurting
lofty dialogues from over there?

1314
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:41,960
India's most wanted terrorist,
Yusuf was arrested last night.

1315
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:44,000
He will be brought to Delhi today.

1316
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:01,280
Hold on, hold on.

1317
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,840
Please, hold on.

1318
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,440
Back off. What are you doing?
Let the media persons come.

1319
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:11,600
Stand at the back, in that corner.

1320
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:14,800
Come on, go back.

1321
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,320
What happened?

1322
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:40,200
What's with the sad faces?

1323
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:46,040
Have you forgotten why you joined?

1324
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:49,600
Was it to get credit
or to do your job well?

1325
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,121
If it's credit you're after,
join the Indian cricket team.

1326
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,600
'A patriot, you are true, alas,
about love, you have no clue.'

1327
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,440
What has she written this time?

1328
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:08,600
Nothing, sir.

1329
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:13,920
You can nab
India's most wanted criminal.

1330
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:16,720
But when it comes to girls,
you get scared.

1331
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,760
Steer towards the shore,
I need to go.

1332
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:26,880
Aren't you scared of
your wife as well, sir?

1333
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,400
Very funny!

1334
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:43,000
