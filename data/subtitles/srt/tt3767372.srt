1
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,979
Budhan, the laundry boy would have come...
and cut the fruits and keep

2
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,086
All I am saying dad...

3
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,130
...just go and sit on the pot...

4
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,186
...it'll happen...

5
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,358
But I am still not
feeling the pressure...

6
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,366
Count these...

7
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,458
Hey Budhan!

8
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,128
Why didn't you give me black currant
with my milk last night?

9
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:19,761
Of course I gave...

10
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,563
This walking around won't help you...

11
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,610
...just go and sit on the pot...

12
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,542
I know my system better or you?

13
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,511
Budhan...

14
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,513
...make a note of 19
clothes in the diary...

15
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,049
You're still here baba?

16
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,608
It won't happen...just
because you're saying!

17
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,687
It will...l say so! Go and try.

18
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,346
It won't!

19
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,215
All right then!

20
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,488
You just don't want
to listen to anyone...

21
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,789
...breakfast is here...eat
it...after you're â€˜donei

22
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,625
Look...
 know that 'potty' feeling...

23
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,670
...just yesterday I sat
on the pot for an hour...

24
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,172

Ivladamji I've been waiting

tell your owner...l don't
need your taxi from tomorrow

37
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,679
all they know is how to fleece you.

38
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,083
Send a cup of tea inside

39
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,059
Sure sir

40
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,325
Reema...PPT

41
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,490
Yes sir

42
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,055
Client is here..

43
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,559
...Piku just try not to argue today...

44
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,333
Look..
 can't stand like a beggar
in front of the client...

45
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,532
...I like to speak my mind...

46
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,169
...if you've issues with that then I
am happy to not attend this meeting..

47
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,614
You are meeting Aniket for lunch.

48
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,981
Come on yaar..not him..

49
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,284
..he's a jerk!

50
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,612
..you can't be so desperate.

51
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,215
I am..
<i>.SO...</i>

52
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,025
shall we?

53
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,522
Syed...Kept it inside

54
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,498
See I get your point...but my driver
was just trying to save the other car...

55
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,624
...so he turned left...

56
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,726
..you were coming from behind...
in speed...naturally...it banged...

57
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,595
Your driver was speeding!

58
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,302
He hit and ran away...so
how's this natural?

59
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,502
Sir, Piku madamji had said...

60
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,671
stay quiet...
what else could this poor man have done?

61
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,081
who would cause an
accident intentionally?

62
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,613
now where did this dent come from?
...this one here...

63
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,551
That was another lady driver
but that's not the point...

64
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,520
Oh really?
Why do accidents happen with you only?

65
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,785
Look don't deviate...

66
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,492
Why is it always that
the guy in front is at fault?

67
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,027
All I know that he has broken this...

68
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,692
Oh hello..settle it or it's
a sure case of 'l-lit and run'...

69
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,263
Exactly.

70
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:08,003
You can't be so safe with the
designs otherwise there is no point

71
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,506
Ya
- Sorry..sir..

72
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,442
...Ma'am <i>. .</i> your father. .

73
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,103
What happened?

74
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,077
There's a message...from him

75
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,443
read it...

76
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,048
Read it quickly

77
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,714
"..day before I
had Semi liquid motion...

78
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,220
...since then constipation and gas...

79
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,185
What should I do?"

80
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,132
Will you say something...?

81
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,043
I am talking to you..

82
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,610
lam talking to you...

83
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,611
"Semi liquid motion first.

84
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,713
Then 2 days of gas and constipation.

85
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,286
What should I do?"

86
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,393
What kind of a message is this
to leave at an office..?

87
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,325
Why?

88
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,587
I think..its a..
serious health issue..

89
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,157
...and we should discuss it..

90
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,567
We cou
d've discussed at home..?
We live in the same house.

91
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,536
But you said you didn't
want to talk to me...

92
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,541
Fine...you cou
d've sent me a te><t..?

93
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,974
Why did you give it
to the Receptionist..?

94
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,411
But just this morning you said
you didn't want to talk to me ..!

95
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,708
didn't you say that?

96
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,312
This morning dad...

97
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,716
I've kept the lunch on the
table..and I've have made Grand Pa's dish

98
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,284
My dish'? Or 'Moong pulses' dish..'?

99
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,515
Just go and keep lunch on the table...

100
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,420
on the Table?

101
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,651
What else did I say?

102
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,021
so I said the same...table...

103
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,059

Greasing is good for motion..

108
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,082
Dad stop being so..difficult...

109
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,414
...from last two days not
a single piece has come out..!

110
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,977
I don't want to die of constipation!

111
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,717
no one dies of constipation.

112
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,958
Elvis Presley did..

113
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,195
Don't look at me like that...

114
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,020
...his body was found
in the bathroom...obviously...

115
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,724
...he must've been
sitting on the commode...

116
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,703
didn't you keep the
yogurt in the fridge?

117
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,198
It's gone sour...

118
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,599
look Piku none of
my problems are smalL.

119
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,199
When you'll be my
age...you'

 understand..

120
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,005
I don't want to get to your age...

121
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,205
you have problems
everywhere in your body.

122
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,739
Imaginary.

123
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,214
Imaginary?

124
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,976
then..see this.

125
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,743
What?

126
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,478
See,

127
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,719
Haemoglobin 15...
normal.

128
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,754
Urine test normal.

129
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,518
Diabetes negative..kidney
function normaLECG normaL.

130
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,654
Budhan..!

131
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,026
when did these reports come?
And why did you give it to her?

132
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,726
That's not the point Dad.

133
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,128
Srivastav uncle asked
for blood Count ONLY.

134
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,002
...then why did you
get these extra tests done'?

135
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,439
so there's nothing in the report?

136
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,239
look at your face...everything
is normal but you are not happy...

137
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,710
really...things will be better
off if something comes out...

138
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,140
kidney..or lung or
diabetes or something...

139
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,615
at least then..there will
a solution to this house.

140
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,710
Look..
've given you full freedom.

141
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,009
don't talk to me like that.

142
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,612
what freedom?

143
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,591
I had to meet Aniket today
for 
unch...but I am here. With you.

144
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,684
Is this how I am going to
lead my life'? discussing your shit'?!

145
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,355
don't bring my shit in between..don't

146
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,625
And this your relationship status.

147
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,567
Yeah SyecL.

148
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,731
if you ask me,
I think...casual is fine...

149
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,172
...that works for me...

150
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,643
he's just all the time
imagining..hypochondriac..

151
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,085
What for have you come now..?

152
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,583
I want to talk to madam

153
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,655
She's not here...go away

154
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:46,713
I know she's inside..

155
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,690
I told you she isn't...go!
- dad..?

156
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,726
Why are you so late today?

157
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,059
I've fired her...she
wont work for us anymore...

158
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,532
I've left this job myself...give
me my clues and I'll leave...

159
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,124
There is nothing due...

160
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,635
dad please.

161
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,571
did he say something...

162
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,504
..when I mop the floor,

163
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,065
he walks behind me
with his dirty shoes,

164
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,634
checking the room as
if I'll steal something...

165
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,543
So so?
What is so wrong in that..?

166
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,379
Three times a day I clean the
toilet and he's still not satisfied...

167
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,148
and today he crossed the limits...he
said I've stolen the toilet cleaner.

168
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,746
You think I'll do that?

169
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,491
Then where did it go?

170
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,254
one minute...dad
- Did I drink it up?

171
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,158
..nonsense..
she's talking nonsense..

172
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,127
Look he didn't mean that...

173
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:29,223
No he's suspecting me all the
time...just pay my dues and I'll leave

174
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,428
I told you there's
no balance..fine Piku...

175
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,666
...inside that drawer I've
kept eight hundred and fifty rupees.

176
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,365
She didn't turn up for three

Well, anyway she got married.

At 12pm it was 98.6..

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,041
After that?
- ..98.8..

00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,765
..yeah...ok bye...bye...bye

260
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,136
...he hasn't seen any
of Satyajit Ray's films.

261
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,500
And he doesn't vote!

262
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,474
I was somehow tolerating him..

263
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,341
you were right...

264
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,536
He's such a jerk!

265
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,340
Did dad call you up?

266
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,540
Yes

267
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,404
Hun..

268
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,385
Why did you react like this..?

269
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,546
Like what?

270
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,524
I said Dad called, so you said "hun"

271
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:19,094
Right...l asked if Dad called you
and you said "Yes" so I said "hum"?

272
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,029
so what's wrong?
- Who reacts like that, What is "huh"

273
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,158
Dad called me...so
you should say "ok"...

274
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,098
...what is "Hun"

275
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,397
I know but you said you
said "yes" ...so I said "hun"

276
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,369
NO you didn't say, you said "hun"

277
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,735
Come on Piku...

278
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,375
...I just said "hun"
so what's wrong in it

279
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:39,108
Piku mentioned yellow. . pulp. .

280
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,717
Right but then 
ater..

281
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:45,114
It was greenish..not black,
but greenish...yellowish green.

282
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,283
Why don't you both
sit with a shade card?

283
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,384
What percent of green..how
much percent of ye

ow....

284
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,592
shit is shit....

285
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,494
..mind your business..!
- But Grand Pa.

286
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,623
my heart says.

287
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,691
One day you'll have a great motion...
just the way you desire...lots...

288
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:01,466
Yeah...then I will
die. . happy. . satisfied...

289
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,404
Why is it a must to talk about
death right early in the morning?

290
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,101
why can't he talk
about something positive?

291
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,643
What is so negative about death..

292
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,736
I am changing the medication dear...

293
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,448
you can alternate with this one...

294
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:16,317
And remember one thing..where
there is a will..there is a way...

295
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,286
...and the way is of outside only...

296
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,184
Pappu you need to
leave for Ivlotibaug...

297
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,661
make sure you get there on time...
- Sure sir...

298
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,754
God knows when the
winters will come...

299
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,330
this summer has been harsh...

300
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,389
I haven't caused it...

301
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,594
did I say it's because of you...?

302
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,000
Then why are you telling me

303
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,504
That's because you're
sitting here so I am talking

304
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,005
imagine that I am not
here and keep quiet...

305
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,268
It's useless talking to you...

306
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,742
So don't talk... go home
and don't come here from tomorrow...

307
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,702
Why should I not come?

308
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,075
Because I am trying to work.

309
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,274
Oh really...even after been thrown out
of your job you still have such an ego'?

310
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,717
Why is it really important
for you to keep reminding me of that?

311
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,584
But that's the truth...

312
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,481
I-I imachal taxi stand. . yes.

313
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,285
No no I understand Rosy,

314
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,298
but your Piku madam said she didn't want
any taxi from us so I didn't send anyone.

315
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:02,997
fine I'll send...

316
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:08,004
Hey who's turn is it to drop
that madam from Chitranjan Park?

317
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,336
Why are you guys si
ent..?

318
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,168
She's a regular client...you'll
have to tolerate her...

319
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,379
...and just because she insists on
driving fast doesn't mean you do that...

320
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,676
...don't you have your own mind?

321
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:22,208
See no one wants to go...
so why're you forcing them?

322
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,684
One minute...don't you
talk like Union leaders here.

323
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,057
Nannu...go take the car...

324
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:32,124
and I am aware what you
and your daughter are up to...

325
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,062
Ritu is your sister

326
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,224
Whatever it is...just watch out...

327
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,733
Excuse me!

Hello ma'am.
- Hello.

333
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,955

you much...start allopathy...

334
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:02,549
illiterate.

335
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,355

And enjoy yourself. .

00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,163

well she isn't married yet..
that's why all this...

346
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,075
..nothing serious I guess..
or am I missing something Piku?

347
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,414
I mean I am not saying I want
to take a long holiday...

348
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,717
...but may be just for a day or two
I can go somewhere..

349
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,151
Piku's right.

350
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,124
...every normal person
needs a break...

351
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,989
...for relaxation.

352
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,724
Oh nonsense...people aren't
relaxed in their own homes...

353
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,228
...with their own families but
they don't mind spending...

354
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,294
...on a train or a plane ticket
just to get to some far away hotel...

355
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,272
...and using some e
se's
used beddings... to feel relaxed...

356
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,071
...and these travel companies are
to blamed for it...it's all in the mind...

357
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,011
lam telling you..find
a nice boy..and..

358
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,139
Isn't your sex life active'?

359
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,548
Your parTnenSyed?

360
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,016
It's a need

361
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,246
right. . its a need...

362
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,949
but that's not a permanent solution...
why don't you both get married ya..

363
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,391
Aunt I don't Know..I'm
not even sure..about him..

364
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,059
Ah..again that useless topic..

365
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,994
You don't know marriage
is a bad word in our house...?

366
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,690
People with low IQ only get married

367
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,958
...you mean I am low IQ'?
My sister was low IQ'?

368
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,664
In this whole world everyone
who is married is low IQ'? - l-li..hi...

369
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,467
Hope you are good...

370
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,098
your Telegraph..last 3O days.

371
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,165
Aah!

ove
y__!

372
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,734
Nothing like Kolkata news..

373
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,076
don't change the topic dada.

374
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,672
Don't waste your time.
- Again?

375
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:36,982
To be together in
good times and bad...

376
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,420
<i>...is</i> it low IQ'?

377
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,989
there's no salt in this..?

378
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,719
I couldn't find salt...

379
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,723
..to take care of
BP...best to avoid...

380
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,485
But we don't have BP!

381
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,120
so stop hiding like this.

382
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,630
again your changing the topic..?

383
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,190
Was my sister lovv IQ?

384
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,725
Not just constipation,
dad has problems with women too...

385
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:57,168
No...not women but their
mentality is what I can't stand...

386
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,177
...your sister too..all her
life she just wanted to please me..

387
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,077
...that was her only
purpose..no aim for herself.

388
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,514
...I wanted her to
be independent...but no..

389
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,075
..she surrendered
herself in my service.

390
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,210
So what's wrong with that?

391
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,254
Everything is wrong!

392
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,053
throwing away your identity..your
knowledge..respect..brain..

393
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:20,062
in the fire while taking the seven
vows and then leading your life...

394
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,790
...well that is a Low IQ decision.

395
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,694
...and I don't want
Piku to take this decision.

396
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,327
But brother, don't say like that
today, on sister's birthday at least.

397
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,169
..when she was alive,
she was not happy...

398
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,537
...wheh she was dying she was hot happy
and how even after dying she ls lsh't happy...

399
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,438
...see...that's what I mean...

400
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,102
You're really insensitive dad.

401
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,369
Piku.. she was my wife..
I can say anything.

402
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,709
But she loved you..

403
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,613
I also loved her..and still do..

404
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,674
Then why are you criticising mom..?

405
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,584
Because I am a critical person..

406
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,553
...brutal and honest.

407
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,490
I am entitled to think
whatever I want to about her...

408
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,549
...but that doesn't mean
that I don't love her...

409
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,529
This shirt that I am wearing.

410
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,397
..she gifted me on my birthday...

411
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,298
...so I am wearing it for her today...

412
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,266
Piku find a right man..and get married

413
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:06,674
Leaving your father's home after getting
married and living in another man's house...

414
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,609
...taking care of that
new one...how foolish...

415
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,408
I gave birth to you...didn't l?
- yes

416
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,036
No tell me...l gave birth to you.

417
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,015
Yes Dad

418
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,416
I never left you and went
away...so now I am your chi
d..

419
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,248
you do the same.

420
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,551
I completely agree with
Bhaskor da's philosophy

421
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,318
God knows how did my sister
tolerate you for all these years.

422
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:26,056
...I don't know..no wonder she died
early..you only mustK/e given her BF'

423
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:33,264
I give BP to you..to Piku,
even to Srivastava...did you all die?

424
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,070
Would you like some Ice cream/P

425
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,334
Obvious
y..
why I did I get it then?

426
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,246
Oh just ignore what Piku
says...She doesn't mean it...

427
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,651
Fine...
 am giving these bills to the accounts
department...just get the payment released...

428
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,451
of course...by the
way how's your mother?

429
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,291
Don't even know how
I was born in that family...

430
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,087
...just waiting to get out of there...

431
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:03,031
...anyway tell your partner to mend her
ways or get used to travelling in a Metro

432
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,130
Why don't you tell her...

433
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,072
Piku..

434
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,542
Piku..

435
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,716
L-li..
- all well..'?

436
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,782
Ya__

437
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,784
I know because of my drivers...

438
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,285
look its fine..

439
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348
I don't have time for
all this discussion...

440
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,224
So when should I come?

441
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,255
For what?
- To discuss this driver issue...

442
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,459
you've had a word with Syed, right?

443
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,695
Ya but.

444
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,296
So then its fine...

445
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,498
See you..

446
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,134
Bye

447
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,151
You need to be a
bit easy with Piku....

448
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,585
...I am really worried for her..

449
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:00,249
Oh...then why did you get married
thrice? If you were so worried..

450
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,086
Excuse me?

451
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,389
After Piku's mother passed away,
Piku needed you..

452
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,063
so I shou
d've shifted here
with Eisha in your house...

453
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,394
...gotten married to you...

454
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:10,456
...just because my sister
was no more...?

455
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,729
hah! only you can have
such idiotic thoughts.

456
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,026
Piku and Eisha..were
never your priority...

457
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,534
All I am saying is
that..and that is very sad..

458
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,630
ls this why you don't like me..?

459
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:22,441
No I've enough reasons
to not like you...

460
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:27,041
...But don't you feed this marriage
nonsense in Piku's mind, don't..

461
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:38,053
Grand Pa doesn't want to meet you...

462
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,088
tell him I am not here to
discuss the selling of Kolkata house

463
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,725
then why are you here?
to know the condition of my stomach?

464
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,792
Good evening dada; how are you.

465
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,539
Actually I met a builder yesterday.
he is ready to negotiate...

466
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,566
...so I spent my own money
for the flight ticket

467
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,543
....just to come and meet you..

468
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,309
you know my decision...

469
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,177
Dada. .try and understand

470
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,749
There is no need to discuss
the same topic again and again...

471
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,177
Go!
- It's a golden opportunity...

472
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,346
...super deal..all these things must
be clone while you're still here...

473
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,718
...then you can peacefully...

474
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,423
listen Budhan...
- yes Grand Pa.

475
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,015
Hope you haven't
made tea for him yet...?

476
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,082
I am about to...

477
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,060
no need...no need..

478
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,596
..just shut the door when
this man leaves...

479
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,563
...and don't open it
if he comes back again...

480
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,226
Irritating man.

481
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,701
Oh that's an insult!

482
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:24,235
I made so much of effort
to negotiate with the builder...

483
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,774
is this how you treat me'?

484
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,069
...I'll tell Piku dicii...she's practical
and will dispose off your house...

485
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,476
Ya fine...go ahead...

486
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,438
I rang the bell for an hour...

487
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,075
useless old man...wasted my time.

488
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,081
...126!88..
its normaL.

489
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,283
L-low are you respected sir'?

490
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,725
Very serious..BP is normaL.

491
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,256
This is not a joke Piku..

492
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,295
Please sit

493
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,228
Greetings ma'am..

494
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,426
That idiot, Nobendu, he again came last night
to discuss the selling of Kolkata house...

495
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,433
I will not sell that house..

496
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,436
that old house is a pain!
- what?

497
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,527
Pain!

498
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,597
I have told you before...l
will not sell Cl-IAMPA KUNJ!

499
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,532
..this year I will go to KolkataL.

500
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,135
I have decided..end of discussion!

501
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,544
Fine then end this discussion

502
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,448
Tell Nobendu not to come again...
what's there to get so affected...

503
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,280
Affected?

504
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,217
Of course I'll <i>be...</i>
I am an emotional <i>man...</i>

505
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,051
If you were emotional...my
sister would've been happy.

506
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:17,527
Listen you Dutta sisters...
I know your habit of blame game...

507
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,063
...and I worry..my Piku
is also becoming like one of you..

508
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,224
...what your Banerjis are like,
well I also know that.

509
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,133
<i>that Mont Baneï¬‚t. . your Aunt</i>

510
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,262
Piku...whole day she roams around in
the house in just a flimsy night gown...

511
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:29,429
...that too without a Bra..!

512
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,372
Really Aunty?!
- Ivlaa even you do the same.

513
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,536
Hey...shut up...l Only do
that when I am alone at home...!

514
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,503
Anyways...what's the point in getting
BF' checked 100 times in a day...

515
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,017
...whatever this Nobendu came
and said and you started panicking?

516
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:46,578
...these are all age related
problems...what's so abnormal in it..?

517
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,090
but...what if my BP shoots up?

518
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:50,423
everyone has some issue or
the other in their lives...

519
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,190
...just for a day if you haven't crapped,
there isn't any need for this drama!

520
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:57,223
Nothing has happened to you; you are
just simply going through menopause...

521
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,360
even men go through menopause...

522
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,703
Oh ignore what she's saying...

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,271
One minute. . . menopause. . . me?

nothings written here...

530
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:23,258

what can he suffer from...?

531
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,999

00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,507

539
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,447
I need to go to other houses too sir

540
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,645
Ya I know...its okay...

541
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,612

542
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:56,689

543
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,692

What...

546
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,973
Sanju is coming to have a talk...

547
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,674
...go change your clothes
or go to the stand...

548
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,612
Why what's wrong with these clothes?

549
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,083
...and in any case he's not
coming to take you back with him..

550
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,044
Look what he's saying mom...

551
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,452
at least we can ask for a settlement?

552
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:28,492
Well he's already left you
so what are you going to settle?

553
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,185
Now earn. . . live your
life. . . respectfully

554
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,561
You're just frustrated and
you don't want even me to be happy...

555
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,066
If you were so worried
about your happiness then.

556
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,000
...why did you steal your mother-in-lavws
diamond ring and give it to mom?

557
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,298
It wasn't your
ring...that she stole...

558
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,306
what does he have anyways

559
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,433
Do you even know what honesty means?

560
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,442
...treachery never brings
happiness...do you get that?

561
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,570
As if you've been righteous always...

562
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:53,344
...e><aotly...how do we know why
were you thrown out from your job...

Aah Piku is here..l
thought you gonna bunk.

576
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:37,524
It wasn't my fault...

577
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,722
...shall we leave...'? - My
driver mustK/e delayed you...isn't it'?

578

You guys chat..I'll just get my Laptop

579
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,073
VVe

...whatever it may be...these are known
drivers...you're safe with them...

580
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,250
...not only do they listen
to you...they're also scared of you...

581
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,081
Nothing like that...

582
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,245
So what about that Honda case...?

583
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,518
I was getting late for a meeting
so I asked him to speed up...

584
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,116
...normal speeding up...he banged...

585
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:13,391
this time again you told
him not to stop after banging...

586
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,623
...and even if he did,
Delhi Police listens only to women...

587
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,166
...no matter whoever's
fault it may be...

588
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,031
you mean I am making
them break the rules?

589
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,195
No no I have no problems
with that...break them,

590
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,206
as long as no one gets hurt...

591
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,304
...in any case I send the
damages to your office so it's ok...

592
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:33,280
No it's not ok...l can take
an auto...l can manage myself...

593
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:37,353
..c'mon Piku; he's just saying that he
has some decent drivers working for him..

594
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,717
So it's my fault?

595
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:44,550
See the point is, everything is mutual...
you don't like them, they don't like you..

596
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,061
did they say this..?

597
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,988
no, but does it matter...

598
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,491
...when it's the truth..

599
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,438
Got to leave...

600
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,275

00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,351
Don't be so judgmentaL.

605
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,588

you are going to take his side..

606
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,061
It's not like that.

607
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,064

Budharmlwow many times to tell you
not to put the tea leaves in the basin

All okay uncle... what happened?

692
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,314
Nothing serious...he just
enjoyed a bit too much...

693
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,034
yeah.. cancel my meetings.

694
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:46,506
I won't come.
- Budhan, keep the lunch simple today.

695
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,306
...put the pan.

696
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,401
where. . ..?

697
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:53,244
On my head...
obviously on the burner...

698
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,656
I'll go to...

699
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,458
I'll go to Kolkata...

700
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,328
PIKU

701
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:17,005
that idiot Nobendu. ..

702
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,539
...I won't sell Champa Kunj

703
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,169
l-low are you'?
- o mother...

704
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,980
I will go to Kolkata

705
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,301
No uncle, I am not worried for him...

706
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,396
...in fact it makes
no difference to him...

707
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:53,409
...if he wants to go he'll go...he
doesn't care about anybody else.

708
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:57,641
now do I write on a stamp paper that
I will not die during this trip...

709
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,545
...will that be fine.

710
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,208
look at his health.

711
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:06,119
Forget logic...from here to
airport and from there to Kolkata...

712
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,121
It's too much Dada

713
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,488
Flight?
Who said I'll take a f
ight...?

714
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,653
I'll get palpitations on it...
- Give me some tea

715
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,953
BP fluctuates at that height.

716
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:19,992
...bathrooms are claustrophobic
palpitation. . . nervousness.

717
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,727
its bad for my condition.

718
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,098
I am not going by train certainly.

719
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,435
Train? Never.

720
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:31,276
never.. never... this train movement
shakes up everything inside...

721
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,316
I get constipation.

722
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,714
that is not a good option.

723
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,575
Just five days back
you've gotten up from bed.

724
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:39,645
cou
d've died...it was
my marriage anniversary...

725
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,055
...why did he have to drink and dance?

726
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:46,084
and then he comes home...drinks...
Budhan why did you give him the drink?

727
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,097
Piku you also didn't bother.

728
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,460
this old man has gone senile!

729
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,694
look you don't interfere.

730
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,091
No one is asking you.

731
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,435
You're my sister's husband
that's why I am concerned...

732
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:59,203
But your sister is no more..
so keep quiet.

733
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,740
hey shrivastava.

734
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,136
there is one way.

735
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:04,271
I've an idea.

736
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,474
I was thinking exactly the same...

737
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:13,319
...you might get tired but
then you can stop anywhere and walk...

738
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,517
Correct. . correct. . correct.

739
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,060
that way things will be in control.

740
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,654
according to my convenience.

741
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,322
Yes

742
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,365
As in?

743
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:28,265
As in nothing...done...decided!

744
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,535
who'll drive that madam
from CR park to Kolkata?

745
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,705
day after morning at 4.30 am...
who's duty is it?

746
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,450
Come on she's not bad at heart.

747
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:46,284
Alright then Dhani Ream. take
the car that has a carrier on top.

748
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,688
Here...take this.

749
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:53,719
Here...

750
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:57,757
take out the other two
suitcases kept in the garage

751
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,006
Budhan

752
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,737
All this will not
fit in one suitcase...

753
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,338
...need another one

754
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,057
He should be here any moment

755
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,238
Where's your Driver?

756
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,282
Am sure he must be on his way...

757
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,680
...or may have stopped
for some fuel perhaps.

758
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,083
I've been calling you since 4 am!

759
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:51,777
Hlcheck

760
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,676
Hello. - I told you my father will
be travelling too...he's an old man.

761
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,617
let me talk to him...and I am not old!
- dad.

762
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,383
Sorry Piku.. I can't get
through any driver just now...so.

763
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,424
We've been waiting for over two hours
now...with our luggage all packed...

764
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,719
...and you are telling
me there is no driver.

765
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,421
Look look..l am trying...
just give me some time.

766
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,327
If you don't know how to do business
then why did you even take the booking?

767
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,059
how's your shouting gonna help?

768
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,167
You just don't talk
in a civilized manner...

769
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:41,066
...and that's the reason none
of the drivers want to go with you...

770
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,729
...do you understand this? - In that
case you shou
d've told me the truth!

771
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:43,698
Ya so even I didn't know this...

772
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,638
...that after listening your
name itself the drivers will run away!

773
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,701
God.

774
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,762
Oh I thought you guys would've
left by now...what happened'?

775
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,024
Driver didn't turn up.

776
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:18,564
good...now take a flight later...
useless plans end up like this only.

777
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:22,441
I thought passing motion before this journey
will give me some relief on the way...

778
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,207
...but no...it's
all hardened inside...

779
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,612
Been on hold for 1O minutes
now... these airline idiots

780
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,174
But why are you calling flight?
Call the driver.

781
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,083
Call the driver.

782
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,050
Piku.

783
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:35,087
Piku.

784
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,387
none of the drivers
are ready to go...

785
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,588
...so...is this the luggage...
should I keep it outside...?

786
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,029
ls he the driver?

787
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,055

788
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,363

stomach?

791
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,434
What is your owner's name?

792
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:52,236
Dad.. he is the owner.

793
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,468
he is the owner.

794
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:57,339
Oh so he's that same irritating
owner you told me about?

795
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,538
Well if the owner is like him...

796
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,378
...then obviously people under
him will also be as useless.

797
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,419
Keep this up...

798
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:05,987
do you know mister...

799
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,455
...because of you my daughter
is going through so much stress.

800
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:08,579

Where is it?

L-lad I known there'll be so much
of luggage, I would've got a mini bus.

Why a medical test now?

821

00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,590
1500 kms.

867
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,999
I didn't ask in Kilometer...l
asked you time..

868
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,503
4O to 45 hours.

869
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,300
...could be more also.

870
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:46,640
Hope you don't intend
to drive after dark?

871
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,767
..night halt?

872
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:51,378
Haven't thought about it
...maybe Benaras.

873
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,649
hey...sit on the seat...idiot!

874
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,285
Yes I'll send the vehicle...
- Should I...

875
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:02,551
<i>Should l...'?</i>

876
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,251
Go with him...

877
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,518
Where's the toilet...'?

878
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,691
hey Budhan come..

879
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,489
Fill up the tank...

880
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,743
Keep saying--

881
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:37,257
ya ya fine..done..

882
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,358
What was that?

883
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,123
Where's dad...?

884
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,635
He'll take some time...

885
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,417
Where's the next stop...'?

886
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,213
Not before two hours...

887
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,954
...after that wherever we find a
decent place...we'll stop for breakfast...

888
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,355
Two hours..'?

889
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:09,957
that's too far..!

890
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:15,191
This is why I didn't want us to drive down.
unnecessarily you force your decisions.

891
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:19,257
Naa ...l never forced.
I said. You agreed.

892
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,495
and you also.

893
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:25,040
When the driver didn't turn up...

almost decided we'll go by flight...

894
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,972
...who told you to come last minute...

895
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:29,238
...and at least you shou
d've
called up before coming..?

896
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,406
what?! Why are you
dragging me into this...

897
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,507
I didn't load your luggage forcibly...

898
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:38,247
...I would've dropped you
at the airport had you asked me to...

899
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,357
we can go back even now...
if you want to that is...

900
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,449
Go back?

901
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,119
who said about going back?

902
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,128
What..tell me..
- l-le said...

903
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:52,031
Look mister...don't you
interfere in our family matter.

904
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:55,467
.. in my house I decide
everything...got it?

905
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,197
But this is a car..that too his.

906
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,765
I know it.. donkey!

907
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:02,668
...here...press this...

908
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,313
and Piku..you said you wanted
an 'adventure trip' so this is it..

909
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:12,377
...adventurous trip you wanted
to go out of Delhi...here it is

910
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:19,016
...so enjoy..sing song..
what was that song...

911
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:24,363
'what if this road never ends.

912
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:31,601
'L-low will it be...tell me my dear'

913
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,737
'what if this road never ends'

914
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:40,439
'l-low will it be...tell me my dear'

915
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,648
Tell me

916
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:43,445
You tell me

917
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:44,508
No no you tell me

918
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,077
you..

919
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,253
you tell...

920
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:54,287
so 
\/Ir. non Bengali Choudhary..do
you know the meaning of this song?

921
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,696
This path...this road that we are on..

922
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:00,599
...if it never ends,
how will that be..'?

923
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:04,299
Well then sing another song,
that has a better meaning..

924
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,709
...to appreciate good
music is also an art...

925
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:28,621
Whoever wants to do whatever... can do
it here...we won't stop here for long

926
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:33,621
Where are you...?

927
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:35,755
You're asking as if you
really are worried for me..

928
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,397
Why aren't you te

ing..

929
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,160
Kolkata.

930
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,462
What happened?

931
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,471
Bathrooms very dirty..it's
morning hours...

932
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,131
...peop
e musfve used it..

933
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:47,335
..God knows when will Grand Pa use it..

934
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:48,570
Keep down the phone...

935
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,134
All the driver are
sitting on my head.

936
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:52,772
I'll handle them
and don't take any bookings

937
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,310
Haven't you informed at home?

938
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,445
No..

939
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,451
..so what is your
father's real problem?

940
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,085
Nothing.

941
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,125
..a weak stomach...that's it...

942
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,028
Then tell him to do
it fast..we need to leave...

943
00:53:13,157 --> 00:53:14,500
...in any case we
have that 'throne'...

944
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,435
...wherever he feels the urge,
we'll stop...

945
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,995
He doesn't eat unless he...

946
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,507
I got it...

947
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,471
...there he is...

948
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,518
...not looking happy though..

949
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:35,053
Did the army win the war..?

950
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:40,219
..a bit.. there were so many
mosquitoes that I could not concentrate.

951
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,361
You don't have to meditate...

952
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,129
...this is the only job that happens
on its own...without any effort

953
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,295
Bill!

954
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:56,634
So much butter.

955
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,211
Checked?

956
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,515
Ye sir all safe

957
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,720
In the morning when I got the call, it seemed
you needed to reach Kolkata today itself...

958
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,556
...but the way family is going now...

959
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,727
...as if out for a picnic... forget 48,
we'll not reach Kolkata even in 72 hours.

960
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,766
Yes...what was the need of
stopping there to buy bangles...

961
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:24,301
...she could have bought them
at Kolkata...

962
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,102
she has got no sense of time.

963
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,074
I have no sense of time...

964
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:34,005
You're not going to let me get married...
let me enjoy these bangles at least

965
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,651
Seriously?

966
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,551
most people here would marry off
their daughters just when they're born

967
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,646
and he doesn't want
you to get married..?

968
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,152
That's strange...

969
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:48,126
...this doesn't happen
even in western culture.

970
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:51,098
western culture is not a benchmark
of progress..is that clear?

971
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:56,234
We were always ahead of them...
always..that..a..Rani La><mi Bai,

972
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,039
Sarojini Naidu,
and...Kadimbini Ganguly,

973
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:06,143
...all these fine women spent their
whole life in serving the country

974
00:55:06,203 --> 00:55:07,978
and all she wants
to do is please a boy?!

975
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:11,077
so many times I have told
you Annie Besant wasn't an Indian...

976
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,282
Still she fought for
our country's independence..!

977
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,014
But all these women were married.

978
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,424
Yes...but with a purpose.
Marriage is not wrong...

979
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:21,224
Marriage is not wrong...but
it must have a purpose...

980
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:25,392
All that a husband wants is that wife should
serve food during the day and sex at night...

981
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:30,028
...but is that what a
woman is made for...nooo...

982
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,236
that is why marriage
without any purpose is low IQ

983
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:38,446
Fine but not all women
are nice and simple...

984
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:43,008
...you don't know...many of them
are very manipulative and scheming...

985
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,485
...what does one do then?

986
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:48,148
women should be scheming...it's not
wrong... because man is like that...

987
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:52,126
...that's why it's alright
for her to be scheming...

988
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,560
What are you looking at her for?

989
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,473
No aunty...

990
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:10,604
...ya Driver is fine...hmm...

991
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,047
...about half way

992
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,687
listen..they're not bad people.

993
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,252
No sometimes that man talks
sense...then suddenly he loses it..

994
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,729
You want the slippers now ...?

995
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:30,988
yes...
- Why do you want it now?

996
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,091
I feel I just unnecessarily
got carried away and now I am stuck...

997
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,727
...between this crazy
father-daughter duo...

998
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,527
As if you had a great life at home...

999
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:39,665
I might just run away
in between...l am telling you.

1000
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,710
no still too far...not
even halfway...

1001
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,776
I don't know if they really want to get
there or they're just on a joy ride...

1002
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:52,178
hey...lool< there ..l had kept
my slippers in the bag.

1003
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,380
Budhan had kept it in the suitcase

1004
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,091
found...
- can't hear you..bad signaL.

1005
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,025
Budhan kept it. ..?

1006
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:07,296
What's this...?

1007
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,539
...are you planning to kill him?

1008
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,597
Mad or what '2
It's his...

1009
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,472
Oh is he planning a murder?

1010
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:17,240
Perhaps for safety

1011
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,177
safety. . <i>_</i> !

1012
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:19,680

1043
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:31,583

00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,618

1047
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,425
I am not throwing it...

1048
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,198
What happened?

1049
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,033
Did the tyre get punctured?

1050
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:32,174
Why don't you throw it?

1051
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:08,739
There's nothing else here...re
a><...

1052
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,615
So you must be having another
source of income as <i>well...</i>

1053
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,515
sorry. ..?

1054
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:46,586
another source of income...?

1055
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:47,381
None.

1056
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,285
Are you sure?

1057
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:49,287
Dad..

1058
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,621
Since when are you
running this taxi business'?

1059
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,094
It was my father's
business actually...so I...

1060
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:00,066
oh the greed to earn more money...

1061
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,767
I had a job earlier...

1062
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,229
Where?

1063
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:06,264
Saudi...civil construction.

1064
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:10,634
Is this what an Engineer does to
earn a living'? A taxi business'? Sad.

1065
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:16,211
They'd promised a big position
at the time of the interview...

1066
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,417
but once I got there...l
realized I was duped...

1067
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,148
Why didn't you come back?

1068
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,785
My passport was them
with a contract of two years!

1069
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,286
God! but who gives the passport

1070
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,022
That's the way it is...

1071
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,120
So then...?

1072
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:32,166
I had a tiff with my supervisor,
even though I was right...

1073
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:33,496
I lost my job...

1074
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:37,295
Hey Piku...your â€˜Paanchu
babu..!' (cry baby)

1075
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,203
What's that?

1076
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,571
Nothing...

1077
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:50,207
...
 mean if you know you were
right then why that sullen face...?

1078
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:53,053
all honest men in the world
have faced similar consequences...

1079
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,714
...it's nothing new...

1080
01:01:56,513 --> 01:02:03,556
...well neither will you gain
my sympathy nor try to gain Piku's...

1081
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:10,597
so you came back..?

1082
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:15,636

ta><i business since then...

01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:50,512

1091
01:02:54,037 --> 01:02:55,482
...well it rained...

1092
01:02:55,539 --> 01:03:03,151
so why didn't anyone sing 'Raga Motion'...
you would've been relieved by now...

1093
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,557
Like Raga motion

1094
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:08,723

Here's what I have...lndian
Basil and mint leaves.

Okay... fine

...would you like to have some'?

1113
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,678
Am I disturbing you..?

01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,514
Can we sit quietly please/P

1115
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:12,019
Ya sure..

1119
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:27,669
I would've thrown
you out of the car..

1120
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,505
L-low would your Dad have
gone to Kolkata then'?

1121
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,507

1128
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:56,027
...and you say you don't
like driving...that's weird.

1129
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,031
Not really...those
countries are like that...

1130
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,432
Ya but your country isn't...

1131
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,166
...moreover...driving
liberates a woman. ..

1132
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:13,575
Are you saying all this to impress
me or you really do respect women?

1133
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,480
Isn't it written on my face?

See that's what I was saying.

1173
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:55,043
But on a chair...?

1174
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,985
Shhh! Now what is it?

1175
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:07,477
Switch off the light

Can I change?

1177
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,386

right.

1179
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:28,098
That basil water did nothing...

Sir do you sit Indian
style or western sty
e..?

style or western..'?

Huh? What do you mean?

1183
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,681
There aren't any toilets
with Indian style these days..

1184
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,122
That's the issue...

1185
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:50,025
...it's the most scientific
way for excretion...

1186
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:52,657
..Rana. . please..stop
this nonsense discussion.

1187
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:53,996
No no its not Nonsense..

Naa..l didn't get you...

1191
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:07,309
This constipation problem wasn't
there in olden days...isn't it?

1192
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,371
right.

1193
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:11,075
Sir let me explain you,
it's a very simple formula...!

1194
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:12,484
now this is our stomach.

1195
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,145
Ya.

1196
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,021
...our intestines
go like this...see...

1197
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,652
...this is our stomach...this
turns here...

1198
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,323
...and after that...makes
this question mark kind of thing...

1199
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:28,492
...and when we...one minute...

1200
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:34,504
...sit like this...it
puts pressure on our stomach...

1201
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:37,170
...and intestines get pressed...

1202
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:44,242
...ancl whatever waste material is there
in the pipeline that slowly comes out..

1203
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,784
...no need to put pressure...it
happens on its own...

1204
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:50,086
are you a doctor?

1205
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,053
And aren't we getting late now?

1206
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,492
Can't leave him like this...can we?

1207
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,051
Sir...should we try again?

1208
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:58,432
Where...here? What if I fall down?

1209
01:10:58,488 --> 01:10:59,728
I want to reach Kolkata safely.

1210
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:02,497
Dad has arthritis...he
cannot do this stunts..

1211
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,469
Budhan will help

1212
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:06,503
I can also...come inside

1213
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:07,234
Na..na..l will try.

1214
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:10,311
Dad..what's wrong with you'?
You cannot..climb this...!

1215
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,473
This is western style,
how will I squat on it..'?

1216
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:15,607
Let me help you...

1217
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:17,049
Dad what if you fall..'?

1218
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,177
<i>Weâ€œ. . . weâ€œ. . hey Budharm.</i>

1219
01:11:19,242 --> 01:11:20,721
Yes.
- Come here...

1220
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:24,020
Fine...when you're clone
with this circus...call <i>me...</i>

1221
01:11:24,047 --> 01:11:24,684
Sir let her go...

1222
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:26,021
We will try

1223
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:27,551
Please hold my hands

1224
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:35,532
Hey go away you both...l
need to take off my night pants...

1225
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,398
Should I also...'?

1226
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:37,596
Yes...go...

1227
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,233
Will you manage to...

1228
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,035
Absolutely

1229
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,538
Done?

1230
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:50,676
...not satisfactorily...but
at least got something new to try..

1231
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:01,357
Don't think you can impress
him or me with your home remedies...

1232
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,500
...we know everything
about constipation.

1233
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:07,660
Ohh yeah obviously...

1234
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:18,510
Grand Pa's been lying still for a while...

1235
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:20,239
Should I check him?

1236
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:23,041
keep quiet! He's resting...

1237
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:25,216
There's no better place
then Banaras for last rites...

1238
01:12:25,275 --> 01:12:26,549
Shut up.

1239
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:29,249
Just check on him...we
can still get back to Banaras

1240
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:41,530
Hey..why are you..?
And why are you speeding/P

1241
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:42,501
I am not..

1242
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,560
Look in front...
ook
in front...oh god...

1243
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:47,369
Relax and sing that
path song you sang earlier...

1244
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:48,271
you should be there

1245
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:52,245
<i>...let</i> him drive...we're
paying you to drive not sit...

1246
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:53,279
She's driving fine...

1247
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:54,280
I know how to drive...

1248
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:56,578
Piku you've never
driven on a highway...

1249
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:58,175
This is how accidents
happen Dad... Keep.

1250
01:12:58,241 --> 01:12:58,651
Keep quiet...

1251
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,051
But what if she bangs...

1252
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:03,454
I don't want to come under
a truck like a dog or a cat.

1253
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:05,288
...I don't like unnatural deaths.

1254
01:13:05,348 --> 01:13:08,295
Stop stop stop the car..

1255
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,994
Slow. . slow. .

1256
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,034
Heyâ€œ

1257
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,600
It doesn't matter what
you like or what you don't...

1258
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,477
...whenever its time...you'll die...

1259
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:25,638
...on a road...in a hospital...

1260
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:32,417
...death and shit... come
unannounced...anytime... anywhere...

1261
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:34,079
I disagree!

1262
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:35,514
Gem...

1263
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:55,531
Do you know patience
is a must for a good driver...

1264
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,108
...I was testing.

1265
01:13:57,333 --> 01:14:01,281
...that's all...come...come..

1266
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,179
lets go..

1267
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:24,602
Who all stay in Kolkata...?

1268
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:27,370
Uncle...aunt...

1269
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:33,146
...actually my mother, dad and I...
we used to stay there earlier

1270
01:14:33,403 --> 01:14:36,213
In any case one leg of
Bengalis is always in Calcutta...

1271
01:14:36,406 --> 01:14:41,287
...yeah but I mean...l feel
totally at home in Delhi also...

1272
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:45,051
Ya but one does have connections
with the place one belongs to...

1273
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:46,592
Correct. . . Correct ...

1274
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,458
But there is nothing for me Babe...

1275
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:52,022
...few relatives...l have no connection
with them...and that house

1276
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:55,195
Which you want to sell off
but I won't let you...

1277
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,326
Are you going to
sell off your home ...?

1278
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,439
Don't know...

1279
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:45,642
Hey Budhan...where
did it's cell go...?

1280
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,550
Cell...

1281
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,111
I gave it to you...

1282
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:51,488
No, it was in your hand when we stopped
at that roadside place for dinner...

1283
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:52,788
Is it...'?

1284
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:54,050
huuhh...

1285
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,459
Turn back the car...turn back...

1286
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,064
What. ..'?

1287
01:15:58,354 --> 01:15:59,628
Turn back the car...

1288
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:00,463
What. ..'?

1289
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,368
My ear plug cell has gone weak...

1290
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,496
...I think I've left it
behind where we'd stopped...

1291
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:07,006
...hey why are you still
driving ...u turn u turn...

1292
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,134
We'll be in Kolkata in a bit...

1293
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,337
Nobody is talking to you mister...

1294
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,004
...do as I say ...u turn...

1295
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,515
Dad...l am sure you have enough
battery that can last you till there...

1296
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,982
...we can't waste
time unnecessarily

1297
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,041
U n necessary?

1298
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:20,011
Oh Unnecessary...

1299
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:24,355
...this ear whistles
due to weak battery...

1300
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,290
...strange sounds
come out of here...

1301
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:27,760
...is it unnecessary?

1302
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:32,528
Why do you think
lam a burden on you...

1303
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,464
lam not a burden...!

1304
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:36,230
L_ool<...l can do everything
on my own...alright...'?

1305
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,236
Oh...Dad...please...you...

1306
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:39,705
Na Na...you be quiet...!

1307
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,467
And you ...you are charging us...

1308
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,636
...if you don't listen to me...

1309
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,681
...I won't care whether
you're an owner or a driver...

1310
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:49,239
...I can take bus also...

1311
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:54,421
I am fit...l am not dependent
on any body ...no body...

1312
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:57,355
U n necessary!

1313
01:16:58,047 --> 01:16:59,458
Why have you stopped here...?

1314
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,352
Fine...you can take the bus...

1315
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,963
...stopping every now and then...b
oody...
even my patience is running out...

1316
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:04,623
Please mind your language...

1317
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:06,189
No I have not said anything wrong...

1318
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:08,132
...and what's with
this burden thing...?

1319
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:11,396
Wonder why parents feel satisfied in
emotionally blackmailing their kids...

1320
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:15,065
<i>...if</i> you were a burden ...you
would've been sitting in Delhi..

1321
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,701
...she wouldn't have cared to
take you all the way to Kolkata...

1322
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,208
...so close your eyes
and sit quiet for sometime...

1323
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:24,183
Sky won't fall if you don't hear
some words

1324
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:31,084
if we keep going like this,
we will take forever to reach...

1325
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:36,658
OK shall we...?

1326
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:47,370
But...what if on the way I
feel like passing motion...then...?

1327
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:54,511
I'll stop the car...

1328
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:57,414
...keep your throne on
the other side of the road...

1329
01:17:57,473 --> 01:17:59,146
...you can do what you need to...

1330
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,711
alright...'?

1331
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:03,490
Good

1332
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:07,083
Alright

1333
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:41,389
Two hours more...

1334
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,469
Sorry

1335
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:55,771
Sleep...

1336
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:58,343
Sure?

1337
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:02,075
Will wake you up once we're there...

1338
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:04,440
Thank you

1339
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:51,422
Didi, they've arrived...
they've arrived

1340
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:53,056
Hey Binod!

1341
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,567
Brother!...come. ..come. ..

1342
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:56,103
L-low are you Binod'?

1343
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:57,466
Come come come...all 0km'?

1344
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,538
Uncle you've lost weight...

1345
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:03,499
Champa kunj...here I am...!

1346
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,475
No no...whole night
we were just awake...

1347
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:06,706
Brother...you must be very tired...?

1348
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:08,146
I am fine...

1349
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:09,410
Get the luggage

1350
01:20:09,672 --> 01:20:11,049
Nothing's changed here...

1351
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:12,245
And whose idea was
it to do this road journey?

1352
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,754
Goshh! you need
a heart to do that...

1353
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:19,215
RanamcomemKaku
he's Rana Chouclhry...

1354
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:20,692
<i>Greetings...Mr Choudhry...
please sit...</i>

1355
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:24,094
Hey Binod, he's not Bengali...

1356
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:27,325
He's the owner of l-limachal
Tourist Taxi stand...

1357
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,595
...his driver didn't
come so he drove us...

1358
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:33,504
Oh...that means Delhi people aren't
as bad as we think them to be here...

1359
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,597
Please don't mind...

1360
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:38,133
Not her fault...well that is the
perception about Delhi people...

1361
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,105
so....Piku...

1362
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:41,810
<i>...get that</i> chair
<i>in...I'll have to leave...</i>

1363
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:43,243
Where?

1364
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:47,784
Where...you can't be going
back to Delhi right now...

1365
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:49,284
...go tomorrow morning...

1366
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,585
<i>No its fine...really...I'll leave...</i>

1367
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,158
No one asked you...

1368
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:53,257
Budhan...

1369
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:54,123
Yes

1370
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:55,288
Where have you kept my luggage...?

1371
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,126
In that room down there...

1372
01:20:57,453 --> 01:21:01,230
No...keep it up
stairs...in that room...

1373
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,298
"Where did that chair come from?"

1374
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:42,273
That's grand pa's commode...

1375
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:46,404
...don't touch it...haven't
cleaned it with an ANTISEPTIC yet..."

1376
01:21:56,345 --> 01:22:00,122
the whole feel of this house has
changed...because brother's here...

1377
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:02,059
ya...but Piku...

1378
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,321
...don't know what
she has grown up to be...

1379
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:09,563
...first she stays with
her aunt Chhobi ...plus single...

1380
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:10,603
...living in Delhi...

1381
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:12,502
He

o...yes Nobendu...right...

1382
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:16,133
...he has not told
me anything...why...

1383
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,137
...oh...ok...

1384
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:20,445
What happened?

1385
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:24,542
Nobendu is saying...brother
has come to fix the house deal...

1386
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:26,281
I am not surprised.

1387
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:29,552
Ivlusfve done sitting in Delhi...

1388
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:30,613
It can't be true...

1389
01:22:31,013 --> 01:22:34,051
I warned you...but
you shouted at me...

1390
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,186
...now see for yourself...

1391
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:39,027
...you respect him so much
but for him we are nobody...huh...

1392
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,796
You're over reacting...l
don't think its anything to worry...

1393
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,333
How's Dr Shrivastava?
He will miss you

1394
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:50,433
I don't think so...

1395
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:53,139
...Dad just forces
him to come everyday...

1396
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:54,510
.l never force anybody, never.

1397
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:57,574
There...Mr. Choudhary...join us

1398
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:59,346
Pass me some pepper Piku...

1399
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:03,488
I had no idea that your bowel
problem had become so chronic?

1400
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:06,651
I don't think it's in our family...

1401
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:08,126
Of course it is!

1402
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:09,654
Our father had it!

1403
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:10,696
But how would you remember...

1404
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:14,166
...you were busy in fooling around
with life...fun...women.. all that.

1405
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:18,171
Were the elders just watching
the show if he was fooling around...?

1406
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:23,000
...and when sister in law and almost decided
to get him married to her sister Chhobi,

1407
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:25,011
...then what was the
need to come and see me...?

1408
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:29,778
Next day I had my M.Com exam...
final paper...but no one cared!

1409
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:33,049
Mom just expressed
it to grandma that...

1410
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:36,682
...its fun if two brother's
are married to two sisters...

1411
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,520
...but its not that she
didn't love you when you came...

1412
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:41,756
You were not even born
then Piku...how would you know

1413
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,397
All I know is when mom
was in the hospital...she said...

1414
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:48,628
...whenever I would get married,
you'll do the rituals on her behalf...

1415
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,466
...not aunt Chhobi...

1416
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:53,035
After mom, you are
like a mother to me

1417
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:58,043
Why dig the old graves...she's come
here after so many years

1418
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:58,771
But what did I say...

1419
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,709
No no ...don't stop
her...she's right...

1420
01:24:02,972 --> 01:24:07,512
...this frustration
is not right...it causes...

1421
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:08,316
Negativity

1422
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:16,489
right...negativity...and
that causes indigestion and then...

1423
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,690
Constipation. ..?

1424
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:21,327
Amazing! l-low do you connect
everything with the stomach'?

1425
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:23,635
Coz everything is
connected to the stomach!

1426
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:27,539
A person's emotion
depends on his motion...

1427
01:24:27,596 --> 01:24:30,304
This is all your nonsense
theory...in your own head...

1428
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:32,240
...it's not that your
constipated all the time...?

1429
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:33,473
Why're you getting angry with me...?

1430
01:24:33,536 --> 01:24:35,174
I am not getting angry...

1431
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:38,616
...but you don't discuss
anything other than this Dad...

1432
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:39,617
...there's a limit...

1433
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:41,052
Just re
a>< brother...

1434
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,020
I am relaxed

1435
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,417
And you don't talk much...!

1436
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:47,755
Do you know Piku...for how
long your uncle sits on the pot...'?

1437
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:49,428
What do you mean...

1438
01:24:49,485 --> 01:24:51,761
...father had
constipation...brother has...

1439
01:24:52,021 --> 01:24:54,399
...and you also have the same
...its in the family...

1440
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:55,127
No brother...

1441
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,635
Yes father had...

1442
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:57,703
No...

1443
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:00,698
You had constipation.

1444
01:25:00,996 --> 01:25:02,270
Why are you looking at me?

1445
01:25:03,966 --> 01:25:06,412
...Unc
e you know about
the water shortage in Delhi...

1446
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:09,074
...still he wants a bucket
full of water...

1447
01:25:09,138 --> 01:25:11,379
...because he's not satisfied
with that jet spray...

1448
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,185
No that's because that jet has a sharp
flow of water...it hurts me here...

1449
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:19,192
And in winters he
demands hot water...

1450
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:23,090
...now tell me who needs hot
vvater to clean his...back side?

1451
01:25:26,188 --> 01:25:29,465
You must know that every third person
in America has the same problem...

1452
01:25:29,525 --> 01:25:31,698
...in fact constipation
is their biggest health issue...

1453
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:33,267
Really?
- Of course!

1454
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:34,774
...still they live care free...

1455
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:36,771
...
ooking at their faces can you ever
tell what's going on inside them...?

1456
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:39,079
Who cares? They're the
biggest economy in the world

1457
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,044
No no...l care...

1458
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:43,710
Now for any normal person...
normal 
ike...for example me...

1459
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:47,144
l-low can you call yourself
normal so confidently...

1460
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:50,086
Hear me out...for any normal person,
a breakfast,

1461
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,146
...a lunch and a dinner...

1462
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:55,025
...these three meals is all that is needed
to smoothly do the job next morning...

1463
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:59,021
...but they...on an average
go once in three days!

1464
01:25:59,054 --> 01:26:01,261
All through the day
they just eat junk...

1465
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,700
...collecting inside
as if a fixed deposit...

1466
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:03,698
...and then one day they
go...and well...do it...

1467
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:04,699
Chchiil!

1468
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:07,607
No no seriously...don't laugh...

1469
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:10,334
and your condition isn't that bad...

1470
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:19,044
<i>...do</i> one thing...just chew
your food like this...lil<e a cow..

1471
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:22,355
....ne><t day you're bound
to have a clear motion...

1472
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:25,281
COW?

1473
01:26:26,482 --> 01:26:29,622
Mr. Banerjee have you ever heard a
cow or a buffalo ever getting constipated...

1474
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:33,360
...or doing a hard cow dung...or
loose...think about it...

1475
01:26:35,457 --> 01:26:36,765
Tell me

1476
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:41,769
Right....his logic is right

1477
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:43,634
Are you sure you are not a Bengali?

1478
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:46,076
Sir not everything is
a copyright by Bengalis...

1479
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,239
You didn't know this...?

1480
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:51,006
No.

1481
01:26:55,277 --> 01:26:56,722
There was a railing there?

1482
01:26:56,779 --> 01:26:57,655
I think...ya...

1483
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,750
That was a new
construction...needs repair

1484
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:00,958
Will get it done...

1485
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:03,963
You're family is
quite interesting...

1486
01:27:05,154 --> 01:27:09,227
just because everyone laughed,
don't think everyone is impressed...

1487
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:10,597
...we are very critical people...

1488
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:15,203
Oh I know...some people just
can't like anyone...it's <i>ok...</i>

1489
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,040
you think I am like that...?

1490
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,345
You are...but...can't
blame you for it...

1491
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:22,211
<i>...actually after</i> a <i>certain
age...one</i> becomes <i>like that...</i>

1492
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,305
...difficult to please...

1493
01:27:23,372 --> 01:27:25,648
Then don't try to...'please'

1494
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:27,118
OK...

1495
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:28,615
Do you know Piku...

1496
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:34,984
Binod was in secondary when our
father started building this house...

1497
01:27:35,184 --> 01:27:37,994
And same year brother
also got a job in ITC...

1498
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:41,067
37, Virginia house,
CHOWRANGEE LANE...

1499
01:27:41,123 --> 01:27:42,602
You remember. ..?

1500
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,398
Earlier we just had ground floor...

1501
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:48,133
..when they shifted here,
that's when this 1st floor was made...

1502
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:50,642
OK listen...my head...

1503
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,548
Can we go out somewhere...?

1504
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:02,045
Ya...I'll just give
dad his medicines...

1505
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:05,114
...the centre of my circumference...

1506
01:28:06,582 --> 01:28:08,960
...I feel is this
place...this courtyard...

1507
01:28:08,984 --> 01:28:11,590
Then after retirement why
did you settle down in Delhi...'?

1508
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:14,964
you knew your brother doesn't
earn as much as you did...

1509
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,264
...to maintain this house...

1510
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:17,234
Can you Keep quiet'?

1511
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:18,066
Why should l?

1512
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,538
No no...carry on...she's right.

1513
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:24,700
...a woman as educated as her should
not be stopped from speaking her mind...

1514
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:26,137
...but tell me 
\/Ioni...

1515
01:28:26,201 --> 01:28:31,412
...in 1979 who wrote that job application
for you in that BATA company...?

1516
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:34,977
I had my connections there...still
you didn't take up that job...why'?

1517
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,388
...because then my salary
would've been more than his...

1518
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:39,619
That's exactly what
I call a low IQ thinking...

1519
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:42,059
...you yourself are responsible
for your frustrations...

1520
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:47,624
...no one else...anyvvays...such
old memories coming back...

1521
01:28:49,124 --> 01:28:51,126
remember Binod...after
mother passed away,

1522
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:57,166
her body was kept here...head
that side...
egs here...

1523
01:28:57,499 --> 01:29:00,946
And then Piku's mother's
body...that too...

1524
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:09,486
Piku lets go

1525
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:11,647
Where. ..?

1526
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:13,620
We'll just go out...just...

1527
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:14,627
But where?

1528
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,393
Kolkata tour

1529
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,222
Hey Piku...Don't be late...

1530
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:20,966
Ya I'll come soon...

1531
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,001
If you're so emotionally
attached to this place...

1532
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:29,066
...then why do you want to
sell it off? You don't need money...

1533
01:29:29,298 --> 01:29:31,972
What? Have you lost it?

1534
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:34,078
Brick by brick I've
constructed this house...

1535
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:37,515
CHAMPA KUNJ can't be sold
ever...it will never be sold!

1536
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,176
Our mother's name...CHA
\/IPA...
that's written on it...Got it?!

1537
01:29:40,242 --> 01:29:41,016
But brother...

1538
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:45,185
No no no! if you can't maintain
it...I'll give the money...

1539
01:29:50,986 --> 01:29:52,988
Turn right from here

1540
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:06,305
Mom used to teach here...then
she met Dad and got married...

1541
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:07,602
And left the job?

1542
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:07,773
Yes

1543
01:30:20,682 --> 01:30:23,128
...why don't you
elope and get married...

1544
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:25,392
he's not that bad...

1545
01:30:26,054 --> 01:30:28,500
...moreover you need
someone to run away with...

1546
01:30:31,226 --> 01:30:32,398
...why didn't you marry...?

1547
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,303
Next stop coffee shop
hhuuhh and then by the Ganges

1548
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:39,073
<i>0K6â€˜!</i>

1549
01:30:41,703 --> 01:30:45,082
There used to be a theater
here.....and now a building...

1550
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,411
That's what happens usually...

1551
01:30:46,475 --> 01:30:48,045
...don't you want
to sell off your house?

1552
01:30:48,143 --> 01:30:49,588
One day a building
will come up there too...

1553
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,314
I am just being practical...

1554
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:55,050
No no I am not saying
you're wrong...

1555
01:30:56,485 --> 01:30:58,055
...may be this is the way forward...

1556
01:30:58,086 --> 01:31:00,066
...guess this is
what development is...

1557
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:04,629
...but if you pull your roots out...

1558
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,034
...what will remain...

1559
01:31:07,262 --> 01:31:09,003
...you know what I mean...

1560
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,634
Yes Dad. ..Crataegus

1561
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:41,063
Carbo veg...6-7
drops...yes I am coming.

1562
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:45,169
You guys must not be
having any medical expenses...

1563
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:47,472
...
ooks like you manage
your own treatment...

1564
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:49,271
Ya...

1565
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:53,174
l-low old is you father...must
be at least 70'?

1566
01:31:54,076 --> 01:31:55,111
Hmm exact

1567
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:57,449
And the way you're being his doctor,

1568
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:01,085
he'll be around for another 2O
more years...which makes him 90.

1569
01:32:01,717 --> 01:32:02,593
touchvvood. ..

1570
01:32:02,617 --> 01:32:08,568
And in next 2O years, you too
will become 50...appro><imately'?

1571
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:13,199
L-lmm'?
-so...'?

1572
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:16,609
50...in just taking
care of your father?

1573
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:20,070
one minute...why are
you saying all this...

1574
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:21,537
...you know my situation...?

1575
01:32:21,603 --> 01:32:23,105
you know he's dependent on me?

1576
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:27,142
Can't hear or see
properly...shoulcl I leave him'?

1577
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:27,652
No no...

1578
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:29,052
l-low will he manage on his own'?

1579
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:32,149
I am not asking you to leave him..
even I haven't left my mother...

1580
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:37,463
...I am just saying I hope
you realize he is a selfish man...

1581
01:32:37,519 --> 01:32:38,224
...no he's not...

1582
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,424
Ya he is

1583
01:32:40,455 --> 01:32:42,731
and even if he is
.....he's my father...

1584
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,431
If he's your father then
why do behave like his mother?

1585
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:50,165
Because Rana, after a certain
age parents can't live on their own,

1586
01:32:50,432 --> 01:32:52,673
...they need to be kept alive...

1587
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:54,678
...and that responsibility
is of kids only...

1588
01:32:58,774 --> 01:33:00,378
...so if someone
wants to marry me...

1589
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:02,353
He'll have to adopt
your 9O year old kid too...?

1590
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:03,685
Of course...

1591
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,559
...will you marry me'?

1592
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:16,626
I haven't gone mad...

1593
01:33:18,126 --> 01:33:19,628
Then don't worry about me...

1594
01:33:19,995 --> 01:33:21,736
No no I am not worrying

1595
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:27,470
dad used to take us there...to show steamers
...there can you see...there...?

1596
01:33:27,536 --> 01:33:31,541

1604
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:45,689
Aunty...

1605
01:33:45,754 --> 01:33:48,257

Sourobh is already married now...

1613
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:27,437

So who all are there in your family?

1632
01:35:13,508 --> 01:35:17,456
My sister,
mother...and father passed away...

1633
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,181
...father died...?

1634
01:35:19,481 --> 01:35:23,554
Death...who said death? Who's death?

1635
01:35:23,618 --> 01:35:25,188
Rama's father...he died...

1636
01:35:25,253 --> 01:35:26,129
Not now, long back...

1637
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:27,131
What was the problem?

1638
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:28,257
No problem as such...

1639
01:35:28,323 --> 01:35:29,461
Died without any problem?

1640
01:35:29,491 --> 01:35:30,595
I mean he had cancer...

1641
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:33,467
So cancer is a problem...why
are you saying he had no problem'?

1642
01:35:33,528 --> 01:35:35,439
...well he had cancer
but it was removed...

1643
01:35:35,497 --> 01:35:37,408
Oh ok...Where was it?

1644
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:39,602
Throat...

1645
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:41,669
Throat...aah smoking is it?

1646
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:42,771
Where are you going...?

1647
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:48,652
So they must've done tracheotomy
..for him to breathe.

1648
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:51,286
Did they reconstruct Food pipe also?

1649
01:35:51,546 --> 01:35:53,048
Ya something like that...

1650
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:54,787
What do you mean
something like that...?

1651
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:55,459
I mean...

1652
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:56,551
You should know what
all the doctor did.

1653
01:35:56,618 --> 01:35:59,030
dad everyone is not
so interested in all this...

1654
01:35:59,053 --> 01:36:01,363
...this medical nonsense
has become your hobby...

1655
01:36:01,456 --> 01:36:02,526
hey I am not talking to you...

1656
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:03,967
I am also not talking to you...!

1657
01:36:03,992 --> 01:36:04,663
then...

1658
01:36:04,726 --> 01:36:06,603
hey...listen where are
you going...then what happened'?

1659
01:36:06,661 --> 01:36:11,076

and then on a ventilator and...

1660
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:14,375
VENTILATOR?! You shou
d've
not put him on a Ventilator...

1661
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:15,379
...it is wrong...

1662
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:18,212
Piku what he did to his father,
you don't do that with me,

1663
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:21,015
I'm telling you...you see...all
this is commercial business...

1664
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:23,750
professional money making...
why did you allow them to do it?

1665
01:36:24,012 --> 01:36:25,116
Allow...l mean...l was...

1666
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,490
No no but why...why did you allow
them to do this to your father...

1667
01:36:27,549 --> 01:36:29,153
look my father was on death bed...

1668
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:30,355
...doctor said we needed
to put him on the ventilator...

1669
01:36:30,418 --> 01:36:31,226
...so what cou
d've I done?

1670
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:34,324
I couldn't have said
no...it's not my decision...

1671
01:36:34,389 --> 01:36:38,098
Of course it is! Do you've any idea how
much pain your father went through'?

1672
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:39,661
...his vvhole body must've
been pricked with needles...

1673
01:36:39,728 --> 01:36:43,505
...drip. . . blood. ..catheter
down below. . . ECG machine...

1674
01:36:43,565 --> 01:36:46,739
...it's inhuman treatment...you
tortured your father!

1675
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:50,408
You get up if the Nurse picks you up...
be at her mercy to change your clothes...

1676
01:36:50,505 --> 01:36:52,348
...and if you've passed motion in those
clothes, then just keep lying down,

1677
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,249
...waiting for her again...
oh gosh...no!!

1678
01:36:55,243 --> 01:37:01,489
L_ool< Piku...when I die, don't do all this
with me...l want to die in peace...!

1679
01:37:08,957 --> 01:37:10,334
DO you always have to over do it!

1680
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:14,266
But...l was only telling
you what not to do with <i>me...</i>

1681
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:18,709
why did he go?

1682
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:22,042
Rana brother...

1683
01:37:23,638 --> 01:37:28,144
...grand pa has sent this
for you and has called you down...

1684

Fish rice...but that too I can't
cook now..we'

1702
01:38:32,607 --> 01:38:36,749
No mutton kebabs, DrShrivastava

1703
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:40,424
But brother how will she
cook rice...that needs water too

1704
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:41,983
Binod it's a useless argument...

1705
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:43,654
oh she just needs an
excuse to avoid cooking

1706
01:38:43,718 --> 01:38:44,696
What a useless argument...!

1707
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:46,493
Shut up!

1708
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:52,402
Where's the water pump...'?

1709
01:39:00,001 --> 01:39:01,412
Its on...check the water flow...

1710
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:03,574
Not coming...

1711
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:20,692
Are you angry?

1712
01:39:21,256 --> 01:39:22,564
Not your fault...

1713
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,095
Now...?

1714
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,402
Not yet...

1715
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:33,544
Am I irritating you?

1716
01:39:35,203 --> 01:39:37,274
I have a good tolerance...

1717
01:39:38,506 --> 01:39:41,578
That means I am
talking to you forcibly

1718
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,513
yes...

1719
01:39:45,013 --> 01:39:47,459
god...just like
dad...ditto...same...

1720
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:49,457
Don't compare me with that man.

1721
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,260
Water is coming...little...

1722
01:39:56,324 --> 01:40:00,033
With your attitude, you won't
find any companion your entire life...

1723
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:03,466
Its not like that...if
I seek actively,

1724
01:40:03,531 --> 01:40:06,444
somebody or the other
I'll definitely find...

1725
01:40:08,103 --> 01:40:09,605
...worry about your self...

1726
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:13,084
...god forbid you shouldn't be left with
Budhan for company in your old age.

1727
01:40:13,608 --> 01:40:16,350
I'm serious...just be aware...

1728
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:20,284

1729
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:26,027

<i>...his family...no no you must go...

1740
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:08,104
Do you know what the real
issue is...Mr. Banerjee...

1741
01:41:08,429 --> 01:41:09,533
What?

1742
01:41:09,597 --> 01:41:12,077
No one understands you...

1743
01:41:17,272 --> 01:41:18,512
You're right...

1744
01:41:19,374 --> 01:41:20,512

Piku sister...all
well...greetings!...

1752
01:41:57,345 --> 01:42:01,589
With this kind of a fami
y...at
least someone should stay calm...

1753
01:42:01,649 --> 01:42:06,189
...balanced...you must begin...
you'll stay relaxed

1754
01:42:06,254 --> 01:42:07,324
I am relaxed...

1755
01:42:07,488 --> 01:42:09,092
Is it?...

1756
01:42:13,661 --> 01:42:15,265
...I'll call you...

1757
01:42:18,499 --> 01:42:21,241
By the way my family is totally...

1758
01:42:26,341 --> 01:42:29,083
...you thought you'll play this game
and we'll sell off the house...?

1759
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:32,249
No no elder brother...that
builder said..othervvise later...

1760
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:34,315
Later means when?

1761
01:42:34,382 --> 01:42:36,726
Later even if all
these people have died...

1762
01:42:36,784 --> 01:42:40,027
I'll be still alive...
to take care about this house <i>ok...</i>

1763
01:42:40,054 --> 01:42:42,261
Why will you take
care of our house...?

1764
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:43,097
Later when...'?

1765
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:46,797
Aunty...Champa Kunj
will not be sold.

1766
01:42:47,795 --> 01:42:52,210
And if uncle has no objection
then lets find a tenant...ok...

1767
01:42:53,401 --> 01:42:54,573
thank you...

1768
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:01,020
Now you leave. ..ok?. ..

1769
01:43:01,642 --> 01:43:07,217
What nonsense...waste of time...

1770
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:46,357
OK Piku...
- Bye... bye

1771
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:17,221
Hey vvait...is this your cycle?

1772
01:44:17,285 --> 01:44:18,593
Yes

1773
01:44:19,687 --> 01:44:25,103
Ya Syed,
I don't know when I'll come...

1774
01:44:57,558 --> 01:44:58,798
Hovv did he even go?...

1775
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:01,000
and why did you not wake me up...?

1776
01:45:01,062 --> 01:45:03,269
But you know him Piku...

1777
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:05,276
Why didn't you lock the cyc
e...?

1778
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:07,279
He'd taken the keys last night...

1779
01:45:08,669 --> 01:45:11,479
I've searched for him everywhere
but I couldn't find him

1780
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:15,280
Go and check once again

1781
01:45:17,011 --> 01:45:20,083
whole life he kept mom
also stuck in all this...!

1782
01:45:20,514 --> 01:45:24,690
she sacrificed her own happiness
to tolerate all his tantrums...

1783
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,598
...he said I want
to go to Calcutta...

1784
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:29,191
...so I said fine...l left
everything and came with him...

1785
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:31,031
...see what he is doing now...'?

1786
01:45:32,093 --> 01:45:33,766
what if he falls
down on the road...?

1787
01:46:39,327 --> 01:46:41,398
He's here...

1788
01:46:58,712 --> 01:47:03,559
I saw everything...
Writers Building...

1789
01:47:04,085 --> 01:47:12,561
Dalhousie...Shyam Bazar...
and these dumplings...

1790
01:47:18,966 --> 01:47:20,411
Who'll eat all this

1791
01:47:20,467 --> 01:47:23,676
Because of him all my life I
have eaten pumpkin... bitter gourd...

1792
01:47:23,738 --> 01:47:26,344
...and now he wants to eat this...

1793
01:47:26,507 --> 01:47:28,350
...sweets and what not...

1794
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:30,215
...get Medicine from inside,

1795
01:47:31,579 --> 01:47:33,183
I know what drama
is going to happen now...

1796
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:36,591
I am fine...no drama will happen

1797
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:38,152
You are not fine dad...

1798
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:39,391
and I will cycle tomorrow also...

1799
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:41,160
No you will not! Do you get that...?

1800
01:47:41,222 --> 01:47:44,635
One month ago he had collapsed.
his BF' had dropped...

1801
01:47:44,992 --> 01:47:49,600
..suddenly one fine day you
can't cycle for 25 kilometers.

1802
01:47:51,565 --> 01:47:54,307
...you think your lungs
are fit to do all this nonsense...

1803
01:47:54,368 --> 01:47:57,042
...your Heart cannot take it,
you are 7O yrs o
d...!

1804
01:47:57,071 --> 01:47:58,209
just doesn't listen.

1805
01:47:58,272 --> 01:48:01,981
I said we'll take a flight
but no he wanted to go by road only!

1806
01:48:04,011 --> 01:48:06,457
Have you ever thought what I want?

1807
01:48:07,148 --> 01:48:09,025
Absolutely Selfish!!!

1808
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:13,960
Yes, I've had physical
relationships...

1809
01:48:14,021 --> 01:48:16,365
...but is this something
he needs to tell every man I meet?

1810
01:48:16,423 --> 01:48:20,371
That meet my daughter she is not a..
virgin..which father does this?

1811
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:23,465
Calm down piku...have some water

1812
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,088
What?

1813
01:48:43,517 --> 01:48:44,325
Aahh

1814
01:48:46,187 --> 01:48:50,636
Rana was right...one
should eat everything...

1815
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:51,669
Done?

1816
01:48:52,326 --> 01:48:57,469
Like never before...Piku!

1817
01:48:58,165 --> 01:49:01,942
...e><traordinary. .! best motion!

1818
01:49:06,507 --> 01:49:09,283
Good...so no cycling
from tomorrow...

1819
01:49:09,343 --> 01:49:12,119
I understand
you all are angry...

1820
01:49:12,179 --> 01:49:18,027
...but everyone's way
to go has been decided...

1821
01:49:18,352 --> 01:49:21,959
...even mine...
I know...even mine...it will be

1822
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:26,460
...through my digestive track...
my life will go from here...

1823
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:31,107
...so let me cycle...l am enjoying...

1824
01:49:31,465 --> 01:49:36,005
...hey BinocL/romorrow...

1825
01:49:43,544 --> 01:49:45,046
Pikunlsiku...

1826
01:49:45,112 --> 01:49:46,250
Haan Kaku?

1827
01:49:46,313 --> 01:49:47,189
Piku...

1828
01:49:48,749 --> 01:49:53,425
See what's happened to brother...
didn't wake up with an alarm also...

1829
01:49:53,487 --> 01:49:56,127
...I also woke him...but
he says nothing...

1830
01:49:57,157 --> 01:49:59,763
Moni..Moni..come fast

1831
01:50:04,298 --> 01:50:05,038
Grand pa...

1832
01:50:05,132 --> 01:50:09,603
I switched on the
light in the morning

1833
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:13,651
He didn't get up...

1834
01:50:17,078 --> 01:50:18,022
Get up grand pa...

1835
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:19,056
Moni..

1836
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:22,025
What happened...?

1837
01:50:24,518 --> 01:50:27,761
Call Dr.Ghosh..

1838
01:50:28,556 --> 01:50:30,627
Grand pa...

1839
01:50:30,658 --> 01:50:32,660
Piku...hey Piku

1840
01:51:41,495 --> 01:51:44,339
Oh..that means either
Cardiac Arrhythmia.

1841
01:51:44,398 --> 01:51:46,241
basically irregular heartbeatâ€œ

1842
01:51:46,434 --> 01:51:47,777
..or Sleep Apnea.

1843
01:51:49,637 --> 01:51:53,141
...respected brother always
wished for a peaceful death

1844
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,580
Yes uncle, no tube..no ventilator.

1845
01:51:58,078 --> 01:52:03,323
..dad was happy,
he said it was the best motion...

1846
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:12,464
...he always forced me to listen to him
but he made sure death also listened to him

1847
01:53:15,556 --> 01:53:18,662
let me tell you
all..clad was in peace.

1848
01:53:19,226 --> 01:53:22,571
..he was in no pain.

1849
01:53:23,497 --> 01:53:29,539
..and those who know dad..they know he
had just one problem. constipation.

1850
01:53:31,038 --> 01:53:33,450
...but that too got
cured before he left..

1851
01:53:34,241 --> 01:53:38,587
..so dad's death was a happy
one and I'm going to miss him...

1852
01:53:40,214 --> 01:53:43,388
now no one will call
me from this room, Piku..Piku..

1853
01:53:43,684 --> 01:53:47,655
Bhashkor da was a
big attention seeker.

1854
01:53:47,721 --> 01:53:53,103
...if that man sees Piku is here
all sad, roaming with her hair open...

1855
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:56,034
...he'll come immediately
and take her away too..

1856
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:01,008
Piku...l love Bhaskor da, ..

1857
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:08,713
Piku...come here for a minute

1858
01:54:09,176 --> 01:54:12,020
or maybe he has already
made a plan of coming back...

1859
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:13,250
...as Piku's kid...

1860
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:16,261
daughter..don't mind me saying
but I need to tell you something.

1861
01:54:16,317 --> 01:54:17,728
..but I will pray to
god...if he comes again...

1862
01:54:17,985 --> 01:54:19,726
...then he should come
without constipation.

1863
01:54:19,987 --> 01:54:23,696
.. you and Syed are close; its ok;

1864
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:26,771
..but respected brother
had just one issue with this...

1865
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:30,368
...
ook its my duty to tell you....

1866
01:54:31,999 --> 01:54:38,609
...he felt in fact he was sure,
that Syed... he too has constipation.

1867
01:54:50,651 --> 01:54:51,686
SyecL.

1868
01:54:53,454 --> 01:54:54,296
You want a drink?

1869
01:54:54,321 --> 01:54:55,527
Do you have constipation?

1870
01:54:56,290 --> 01:54:57,064
Huh?

1871
01:54:57,257 --> 01:54:59,032
do you have constipation/P

1872
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:01,001
Ya__

1873
01:55:01,028 --> 01:55:02,234
Why didn't you tell me before...

1874
01:55:02,296 --> 01:55:07,712
I mean..its not
chronic..just..Piku...

1875
01:55:15,709 --> 01:55:19,714
here... is the balance amount...
and this is for petrol

1876
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,420
And what about that
outing on Ganga ghat.

1877
01:55:24,084 --> 01:55:25,563
..and that mental torture that I
went through because of your dad..

1878
01:55:25,619 --> 01:55:27,326
...where is the money for all that'?

1879
01:55:28,455 --> 01:55:31,766
My god yaar...he kept
everyone on their toes...

1880
01:55:34,328 --> 01:55:37,707
You can't judge parents
no...no matter how they are...

1881
01:55:37,998 --> 01:55:42,037
After taking care
of that kind of a man.

1882
01:55:43,203 --> 01:55:46,150

of Rani La><mi Bai... Annie Besant...

1883
01:55:46,206 --> 01:55:51,280
...kinds...you know...
the great women...

would've done that

1885
01:55:58,786 --> 01:56:00,424
No one does it these days

1886
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:05,297

1889
01:56:18,705 --> 01:56:24,121

dad has prepared me..

1890
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:32,430

..BHASKOR.BHASKOR..KOR..not KAR...

1892
01:56:38,592 --> 01:56:41,402

01:56:42,663 --> 01:56:44,108
