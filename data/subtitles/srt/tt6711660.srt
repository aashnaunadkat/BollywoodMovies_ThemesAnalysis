00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
<i>Massage?</i>

3
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>Come in.</i>

4
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,520
Shut the outside
door on your way out.

5
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,240
It's not me its my wife
who needs a massage today.

6
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,120
Lie down, he massages really well.

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,800
Give her a really
good massage, okay.

8
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,520
Take her clothes off.
Don't be embarrassed.

9
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,880
Carry on. I have a call to make.

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Hello...

11
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,560
Yes Mr. Dubey, how are you?

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,400
I tried explaining you, Rastogi.

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,920
How often did I tell
you Rastogi to mend your ways?

14
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,880
So you found out?

15
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,000
I kept telling Mr. Mondal to
give the contract to you, Mr. Dubey.

16
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,040
But he found my
tender more viable.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,040
What to do?

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
Do you think I don't
know what you've done?

19
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,320
How many women did you send him?

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,280
1? 2? 10? 20? Tell me!

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,560
Sir, Mr. Mondal has sent
his engineer to see you.

22
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,256
You send these girls and force
them to sleep with the clients?

23
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,640
Tell me!! Why have you shut up?

24
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,000
I sent my wife.

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
Would you send your wife?

26
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,600
No, I've sent someone else to you.

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,280
- Are you an engineer?
- No.

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,480
I outsource

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,800
for the God of Death.

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,240
Why are you so scared?

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,440
I don't kill for free.

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,960
I've been paid for only one kill.

Go tell your mom.

71
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,000
Mom has no time.

72
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,240
Get lost you asshole.

73
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,000
So, Bhupati.

74
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
Hey.

75
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,960
How's your ass?

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,760
What can I say?
It's started bleeding now.

77
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,680
If I eat anything spicy...

78
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,600
The next morning
I feel like its on fire.

79
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,160
The doctor's advise surgery.

80
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,280
Then get it done.

81
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,600
But remember.

82
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
To make sure the doctor
isn't inclined the other way.

83
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,040
How much?

84
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,240
The usual.

85
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,240
5 for me... 15 for you.

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,360
Next time 20 won't do.

87
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,080
Tell Dubey I told you.

88
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,640
I already have. He's said
the next job will be with a raise.

89
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,600
And yes, your sister had called.

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,640
I mean the one who is in politics.

91
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,120
For "Raksha Bandhan"
function where

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,680
she will tie a thread on all
the men to make them her brothers.

93
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,760
Long time Jiji (older sister)
So Babu... you've become so dark.

94
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,920
Dark skin is in high
demand these days.

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,560
Do we have beer?

96
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,880
Why did you call him?

97
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,000
Give him Phoolchand's details.

98
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,920
I could've easily done that job.

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,680
Why call this idiot?

100
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,960
You see Triloki...

101
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,880
It's one thing to
brag your ass off.

102
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,000
But staring in someone's
eye and shooting him in the face

103
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,696
is a different thing.
Your balls can get blown off.

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
Understand.

105
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,000
You see Babu...

106
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,160
I don't even need a bullet...

107
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,760
I can break their
necks with my bare hands.

108
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
How about I demonstrate it on you?

109
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,840
Have a chilled beer.

110
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,760
Give him Phoolchand's details.

111
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,520
Don't get so hot headed...

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,560
Save your heat...

113
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
For later.

114
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Ticket.

115
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,240
Show me your ticket.

116
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,440
What?

117
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,800
Ticket.

118
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,240
Are you new?

119
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Why?

120
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,280
Come, I'll show you.

121
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,120
- What is this?
- Ticket.

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,520
- Okay-okay.
- No, take a look.

123
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,880
No... it's okay it's okay-okay.
Take a look.

124
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,760
- No, no take a look.
- No... go.

125
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,920
Go sit in your seat.

126
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
How much?
- 25 rupees.

127
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
25 rupees?!

128
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,160
25 rupees for sewing 5 stitches?

129
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,600
5 for the stitches

130
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,160
and 20 for ogling at me.

131
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
What else?

132
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,200
Give me big nails.

133
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,200
Do you want anything else? I do.

134
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,160
I want her.

135
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,040
I mean... I want the big nails.

136
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,520
Why don't you give her first?

137
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,680
How much?
- 100 grams.

138
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,960
That's enough... only 100 grams.

139
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,720
Here... keep it.

140
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,480
It's for you.

141
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,000
It's free.

142
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,560
She's one dangerous woman.
Why did you try to hold her hand?

143
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,680
Don't forget to take a Tetanus shot.

144
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,400
So what have you come
to get stitched today?

145
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,800
Today I have come
only to ogle at you.

146
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,440
Did you see what I did
to that that rascal yesterday?

147
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,520
And that's why I've fallen
head over heels in love with you.

148
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
You see this?

149
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,560
This needle?

150
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,720
You don't need to carry a weapon.

151
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,816
All you have to do is look into any
decent man's eyes and he will be dead.

152
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh really?
Then how come you're still alive?

153
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,440
Because I'm not a decent man.

154
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,760
Time for duty.

157
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,800
Why are looking at me this way Sir?

158
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,880
Do you think I'm lying?

159
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,760
No-no... but you were there.

160
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,520
So... you must have seen him.

161
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,200
But it was impossible to
see his face from such a distance.

162
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,720
She says she didn't see him.

163
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
She didn't see him?

164
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,120
I'll fuck the bitch.

165
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,000
Then let me see how she forgets.

166
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Shut the fuck up!

167
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,840
Listen... let her go.

168
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,240
You're hell bent on
taking my life, are you?

169
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,816
Rascal, who the hell
do you think you are

170
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,240
barging into my house.

171
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,320
I want to know... why didn't
you tell the police about me.

172
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,360
Have you fallen in love with me?

173
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,440
It happens. It happens.

174
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,320
Love at first sight
can happen anytime.

175
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,920
There's a mirror right there...

176
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,320
Go see your face.

177
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,280
I see it in your eyes.

178
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,520
I may not be tall,
but I'm dark and handsome.

179
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,280
That's why girls like
you are crazy about me.

180
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,160
Are you drunk?

181
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,960
So then why didn't
you tell the police?

182
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm asking you something.

183
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,280
If it's bothering you so much
I'll go tell them.

184
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,680
Why didn't you tell
them when they asked?

185
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,360
They raped me.

186
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,120
All three brothers...

187
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,280
Do you want to know how many times?

188
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,400
You killed one of them.

189
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,840
Kill the other two...

190
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,960
I'll give you anything you want.

191
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,400
I'll be your mistress.

192
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,320
Just kill them.

193
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,960
Will you kill them?

194
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Can you kill them?

195
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,960
Hey...

196
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,120
What was the need to fuck things up?

197
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,360
What did I do?
I sent you to kill Phoolchand.

198
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,001
Why did you kill his brothers
Roopchand and Premchand too?

199
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,320
Oh that! I'm not charging
you for those two.

200
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,800
Festival gift, from me.
Three for the price of one.

201
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,200
Fuck your festival gift!

202
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,760
Premchand was going to support us.

203
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,200
He's the reason why we
sent you to kill Phoolchand.

204
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,760
And you bloody fucker,
killed him too!

205
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,656
You should've told me.
What do you mean you should've told me?

206
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,520
You should've just done
what we told you to do.

207
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,320
The thing is Triloki,
I take contracts to kill people

208
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,720
not to spare them.

209
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,240
I see...

210
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,080
My wish, I will kill whoever I like.

211
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,160
If you have the balls,
let's see you do something about it.

212
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,880
Bloody motherfucker,
if you misbehave with my brother

213
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,720
I will bury you alive! Triveni.

214
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,760
Triloki, tell him to calm down.

215
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Calm down, brother.

216
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,360
Jiji, can I say something?

217
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,280
Don't take it to heart...

218
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
When you keep a dog,
it should be of a good breed.

219
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,960
Because then he knows when to bark,
who to bite

220
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,520
and how hard to bite.

221
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,640
Otherwise there will be problems.
You're right.

222
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,160
I sent you to bite someone else
and who did you bite?

223
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,760
Okay... it's fine.

224
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,400
Now on, you don't cross my path
and I won't cross yours.

225
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,520
Have fun.

226
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,840
See you, goodbye. See you later.

227
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,920
Sumitra.

228
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,840
Sumitra, where are my slippers?

229
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,680
Wait, I'll give them.

230
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,520
Here.

231
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,400
Call me when you're done.

232
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,040
And listen, what about Babu?
Babu is dead.

257

Mr. Ashfaq controls the
entire area of Behram Pada.

258
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,080
If we let him contest from there
then victory is ours for sure.

259
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,760
We have three other candidates

260
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,280
who have a good image
amongst the public.

261
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
But before that

262
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,080
we must deal
with Jiji's henchmen.

263
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,200
What are you doing?

264
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,560
Don't you have work to do?

265
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,720
Don't you have work to do?

266
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,640
Babu, where are you?

267
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,440
Here comes the pain in the arse.

268
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,520
I clearly heard that.

269
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,120
I've a problem in my arse,
not my ears.

270
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,800
I didn't come here for free booze...
It's official.

271
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,600
Mr. Dubey has joined politics.

272
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,720
He's given you a contract for three.

273
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
I told him we won't work
at the old rate any more.

274
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,360
So he's paying an extra 5000.

275
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,200
And you get to keep all of it.

276
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Nothing for me.

277
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Happy?

278
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Not you, I need to speak to Jiji.
Move aside.

279
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,120
We need to talk in private.

280
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
What is it?

281
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,440
Dubey's given me a contract
to kill three of your men.

282
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,760
That also includes
your most trusted... Triloki.

283
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,600
You've taken a contract
to kill Triloki?

284
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,520
Jiji, you're just...

285
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,280
I call you sister.

286
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,760
I've known you for years,
so I thought I should tell you.

287
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,600
I think you should
hide him somewhere.

288
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,040
It will be safe for him.

289
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,720
Do you have any shame or not?

290
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
You call me your sister

291
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,216
and you're threatening to
kill one of my most trusted men.

292
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,336
But he's not my
brother-in-law, is he.

293
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,400
If I see him roaming outside,
I'll have to kill him.

294
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,200
You'll 'have' to kill him?

295
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,880
Let's see you do it!

296
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,760
Jiji, I just came to tell you that...
No!

297
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,560
Let's see you kill him now.

298
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,800
I challenge you. If you're not the son
of a whore, let's see you kill him.

299
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,320
Let's see if you really
have the balls to kill him.

300
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,400
What's wrong, Sumitra?
Who are you talking to?

301
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,640
To a fucking traitor.

302
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,640
Traitor?

303
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
So now I'm a traitor?

304
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,800
Fine...

305
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,080
I'm going to kill all three.

306
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,640
But I'm going to kill
your favorite one last.

307
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Yes, go ahead Ansari.

308
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,560
That Babu had to see Jiji.

309
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,680
- Reason?
- Don't know.

310
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,560
But Triloki was there.

311
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
And he still is, alive.

312
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,560
Should I talk to Yasmeen?

313
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,840
Yes.

314
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,680
Look... there he is. Catch him.

315
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,560
Catch him.

316
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,920
You've made me run!
You won't be spared!

317
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,800
How many kids does
Bajarangi have, man?

318
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,536
One of his sons is old
enough to be his grandson.

319
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,640
I wonder what he eats.

320
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,880
His wife must be
seriously screwed up.

321
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,280
- What happened?
- Get down.

322
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,160
- Here?
- Yes, get down.

323
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,800
If you say so...
Thanks for helping me out.

324
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,120
Otherwise, people don't
even ask if you need help.

325
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,040
So is thank you enough,
or should I pay in cash?

326
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,160
Fine, I'll pay...

327
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,840
You dare lay hands on my target
I will break your arms.

328
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,640
Do you know who I am?

329
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,000
The name's Babu. Babu?

330
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,920
Babu who?

331
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Babu Bihari!

332
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,800
I am a big fan...
since I was a kid.

333
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Honestly.

334
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,600
I was only 10 years old

335
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,400
when I got in this
profession with my uncle.

336
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,080
Since them I've been hearing stories
about you and your escapades.

337
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,400
You killed the Headman of Bhadoi.

338
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,520
In the Kumbh fair.

339
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,360
That was amazing.
Everyone was shaken up.

340
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,480
And also the one in the theatre...

341
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,040
I still remember.

342
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,160
I've killed two
guys in the same way.

343
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,200
Actually, you're my guru.

344
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Guru!

345
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,240
I am telling the truth.

346
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
I even named myself after you.

347
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,760
Banke Bihari.

348
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,920
Any last wishes?

349
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,880
One autograph please.

350
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,000
Stop-stop-stop.

351
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,520
He's the one.

352
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
- Dubey sent him.
- So?

353
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,080
So? Doesn't he trust me?

354
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,656
What's the point in giving the
same job to two different people.

355
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,040
Babu, elections
are around the corner.

356
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,776
Someone must have goofed
up in all this tension.

357
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,600
In any case, whoever completes
the hit gets the money.

358
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,000
If you kill them,
why will this fucker get paid?

359
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,376
That's exactly what
I was telling him.

360
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Get lost asshole.

361
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,416
He messed up everything back there.
Shat all over.

362
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,680
He won't do anything
but make things difficult for me.

363
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,320
I think Sir's fear
is something else.

364
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,560
If I kill those three before him

365
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,280
then he'll lose not only the money,
but also his name and reputation.

366
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,320
You'll kill them? Before me?

367
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,520
He's my mentor.

368
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,480
The disciple's always just
two steps behind the mentor.

369
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,560
If you're old gold.
I'm the new spark!

370
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,240
Okay son, let's play a game.

371
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,160
Whoever kills two
out of three wins

372
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,760
gets paid for all three hits.

373
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,856
And the one who loses
quits this profession.

374
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,440
- Do you agree?
- Hey man...

375
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,856
What about my commission?
Who's going to pay that?

376
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,160
- Agreed.
- My commission.

377
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,960
You just watch...

378
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,440
I'll kill all three before you.

379
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,360
My name's Banke Bihari.

380
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,560
Ask anyone...
I've a reputation in the market.

381
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,200
Have you ever had popcorn? Yes.

382
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,600
Do you know how it's made?

383
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
No.

384
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,760
When corn is cooked in the wok

385
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,760
it makes a lot of noise. Do you know why?
No.

386
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,000
No?

387
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,720
Because its arse is on fire.

388
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,800
Babu...

389
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,160
Hey, Babu.

390
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,040
Quitting the business,
is this a joke?

391
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,360
I don't mean to say
he will kill them first

392
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,360
but, what if he does...

393
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,920
When you gotta shoot,
shoot, don't boost.

394
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,200
Every gun has its own tune.

395
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,400
It's very important.

396
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,600
Don't worry, Yasmeen.

397
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,560
Like I said, I'll handle all that.

398
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,136
You just give him
the measurements, okay.

399
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,280
Yes-yes-yes...

400
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,520
I am coming.

401
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,160
Let me get dressed first.

402
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,960
Mr. Shabbir is making a film.

403
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,960
We were in a story sitting.

404
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,600
Did you get the job done?

405
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,320
Do you know who I met today?

406
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Guess...

407
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,520
Babu.

408
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,720
Babu? Babu Bihari?

409
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,816
He's been given the contract
to kill the same three men

410
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,640
which Ansari gave you.

411
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,160
What the fuck!

412
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,000
What do we do now?
I have a plan.

413
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,960
Want to know?

414
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,240
Listen.

415
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,840
Come.

416
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,040

455

Don't be scared, sir.

456
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,360
I wouldn't have waited
so long if I wanted to kill you.

457
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,920
- So do you give up?
- Not yet.

458
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,240
The game's just begun.

459
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,840
Then?
- I am here to recover 2500 rupees from you.

460
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,760
I fired 10 rounds because of you.

461
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,000
Each bullet costs 250 rupees,
you know.

462
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,160
Is that all?

463
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,360
- How many did you kill?
- Three.

464
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,520
I would've recovered
60,000 instead of 2500.

465
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,120
I never kill for free.

466
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,640
You get 20 to kill a guy?
- 25.

467
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,920
5 that fatso takes away...

468
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,280
- Bhupati.
- What the fuck!

469
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,800
Commission.

470
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,960
25000 to kill one person.

471
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,560
No one's even prepared
to pay me 12,000.

472
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,496
They agreed to pay me 10
after a lot of haggling.

473
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,440
Otherwise they pay me just 8000

474
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,480
which they've been paying
for the last five years.

475
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,296
Tell me, how much has
inflation' gone up in 5 years?

476
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,880
Inflation goes up every year.

477
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,080
25,000 rupees and Bhupati
takes 5000 from that.

478
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Here.

479
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,320
The booze is free. Have it.

480
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,680
5000?

481
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,240
Otherwise if you have to pay for it,
you'll say it's expensive.

482
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,080
Fucked...

483
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,680
My life's fucked...

484
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,000
You...

485
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,840
If your life's fucked,
what's all the attitude about?

486
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,400
That was my first job.

487
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,200
I got paid 2000 for it.

488
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,560
Later, when I got a bit famous.
It got raised to 5000.

489
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,560
Five years went at the same rate.

490
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,320
Finally now I'm paid 8000.

491
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,400
How much did you
get for your first job?

492
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,120
Two bananas.

493
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,680
Two bananas! What the fuck!

494
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,680
I maybe crazy, but not insane.

495
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,720
Who kills someone for two bananas?

496
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,000
A 10 year old kid,
who hasn't eaten for four days...

497
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,120
Can kill the whole fucking
world for two bananas.

498
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,560
10 year old?

499
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,000
So you... you actually shot
someone at the age of 10?

500
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,040
No-no I killed him with a stone.

501
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,920
I learnt how to shoot a gun in jail.

502
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,520
Respect sir.

503
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,816
I salute you.
I want to touch your feet.

504
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,960
I need your blessings.

505
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,600
I salute.

506
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,720
Don't even think of dying
before the game is over sir.

507
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,680
If you die, who will I defeat?

508
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,640
Don't worry, son.

509
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,120
I will defeat you by 3-0.
Remember.

510
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,320
How much?

511
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,280
1 quintal.

512
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,400
Mughlai Darbaar.

513
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,720
1 quintal Mughlai Darbaar.

514
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,720
How much?

515
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,280
25 quintal

516
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,000
32 quintal.

517
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,400
- Murtuza Kabab Corner.
- Hey...

518
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,920
32... Murtuza Kabab Corner

519
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,520
I've got the stuff as well.

520
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,360
Aye careful with that!!

521
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,840
Aye careful with that!!

522
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,080
Make sure they take the bullet out.

523
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,760
Stop it... as soon as I get home...
Mom, dad's back home.

524
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,960
As soon as I get home, you guys lose it.
I shot you. Now die!

525
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,120
Oh hell...

526
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,440
What?

527
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,640
Get lost.

528
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,280
Run away.

529
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,720
Catch.

530
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,600
Bloody...

531
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,240
Oh God...

532
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,360
You call these 'kids'?

533
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,920
Since when have I
produced them myself?

534
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,680
It's all thanks to you.

535
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,960
- Give me the water.
- Here.

536
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,960
Let me tell you clearly...

537
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,040
If it's a girl this time,
then fine.

538
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,096
Otherwise I'm getting
myself operated. No more kids.

539
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,840
Ya... ya... go get it done.
Who is it?

540
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,880
Asshole calling.

541
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Get lost!

542
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Hail India sir.

543
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Yes, sir.

544
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,440
You...

545
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,840
Wait, you...

546
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
No, it's nothing sir.

547
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,040
I'll be there, sir. Okay sir.

548
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,520
Tarashankar Chauhan is your name?

549
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,640
Do you know Babu?

550
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Babu Bihari.

551
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,280
The same guy who killed Bajrangi.

552
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,480
Oh yes...

553
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,200
But Babu...
why will he kill your men?

554
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,640
He's like family to you.

555
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,960
Was.

556
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,200
Now he licks Dubey's balls.

557
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,960
Bastard came and told me himself.

558
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,776
Dubey's given him a contract
to kill three of our men.

559
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,200
The first was Bajrangi.

560
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,840
When's your turn?

561
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,440
Second or third?

562
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,440
Third!

563
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,520
What? Did I crack a joke? No...

564
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,880
I...

565
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,320
I was just wondering that

566
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,160
all this time you raised
him so well to screw others

567
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,800
but never imagined that
he'll screw you back instead.

568
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,840
Sorry.

569
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,920
Madam, it's the laundryman.

570
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,760
No need for any grand arrangements.

571
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,120
Just keep it low...

572
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,200
Yes, I know.

573
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,240
But just do as I tell you.

574
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
Just get 2, 4...

575
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,560
Stop...

576
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,440
So... Babu Bihari.

577
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,280
How are things?
Well... I'm still alive.

578
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,120
Not for long.

579
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,920
Nothing in life comes
with a guarantee.

580
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,200
But one thing's for sure...

581
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,600
I'm not getting bumped off
at the hands of a bloody policeman.

582
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,120
Yes, Meena.
We're out of onions and potatoes.

583
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah...

584
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,920
You'll need to get some. I will.

585
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,160
You always inform after
we run out of them.

586
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,960
Do you need anything else?

587
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,080
I'll call if I need anything else.

588
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,720
Okay.

589
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,600
- What?
- What?

590
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,880
Nothing.

591
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,240
Let's go.
You seem to be in a hurry.

592
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,200
Really?

593
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,600
Game over!

594
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,560
What happened?

595
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,360
Oh God!

596
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
Want some?

597
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,120
Is it local brew or malt?

598
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,080
- Malt.
- Yeah I'll have malt.

599
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
There you go...

600
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,880
It's really tasty.

601
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,440
Drinking policeman's booze is
a completely different experience.

602
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
Isn't it?

603
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,760
Why you... Motherfucker...
Bastard...

604
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,000
Tell me Babu,
who was your partner?

605
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,080
Tell me...

606
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,640
Come on come on... tell me...
who was it...

607
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,480
He wasn't my partner.
Then who was it?

608
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,040
He's my fan.

609
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,040
You motherfucker...

610
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,480
Bastard!

611
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,680
Let go!

612
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,560
Yes, Meena...

613
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,600
The house is infested
with mosquitoes

614
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,240
and we're fresh
out of mosquito coils.

615
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,960
If I make it back home, I will.

616
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,720
What's all that noise?

617
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,800
Is it gunfire?

618
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,720
No dear... they're just firecrackers.

619
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,080
I had a tough time with
the mosquitoes last night.

620
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,440
Do you understand?

621
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,640
Don't forget to get them.

622
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,000
Bloody...

623
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,560
Why did you save me?

624
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,680
Why didn't you tell
that cop about me?

625
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,040
I am an asshole.
Well, I am a bigger asshole!

626
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,560
Ticket.

627
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,680
- Ticket.
- Ticket.

628
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,440
Come, I'll show you.

629
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,360
Where are you taking me?

630
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,040
- What's this?
- Take a look.

631
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,640
I don't want it. No-no...

632
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,200
- Take a look.
- No...

633
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,360
Look carefully.

634
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,000
I said I don't want it.
Listen...

635
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,320
You don't want to see the ticket?

636
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,400
Do you know what one
ghost said to the other - What?

637
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,960
I hardly see you these days.

638
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,640
Do you know what one wall said
to the other? Meet me in the corner.

639
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,320
It's nothing, I'm still alive.

640
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,360
Why did you come back alive?

641
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,920
You should've come in a body-bag.

642
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,920
It would've been better
than showing up like this.

643
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,600
- Banke.
- Ya?

644
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,720
Let's die and come
back in body bags.

645
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,560
Where the fuck are you going?!

646
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,520
Look at yourself...

647
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,520
You can't even walk.

648
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,480
<i>I'm still alive.</i>

649
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,800
I really owe you for this.

650
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,440
Lie down.

651
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,480
It's nothing, I'm absolutely fine.

652
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,160
What fine... just lie down quietly!

653
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,120
<i>♪ O sweetheart... buy me
a pair of sunglasses. ♪</i>

654
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,720
<i>♪ Because I'm not getting
my youth back. ♪</i>

655
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,240
- And what are you?
- Banke.

656
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,080
Banke Bihari.

657
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,720
I saved his life.

658
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,440
How can you be so stupid?

659
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,200
Why did you bring
him back here like this?

660
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,216
Couldn't you have taken
him to a hospital instead?

661
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,640
Back in the city, the doctor
checks the patient later

662
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,640
and calls the police first.

663
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,560
So what are you carrying this for?

664
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,880
To show off?

665
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,800
You should've put this
on the doctor's head!

666
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,816
His threat to call the police would
come out of his arse like a fart.

667
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,960
I told him to bring me here.

668
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,376
Oh ya? Because there's
a doctor at your disposal here?

669
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,560
Look at that wound.

670
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,640
It's turned blue.

671
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,920
Dr. Phulwa?

672
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,120
What are you doing?

673
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,280
I am going to severe your arm.

674
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,800
What's it to you?

675
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,160
Then how am I going to
clean my arse after I shit?

676
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,280
Don't move... lie still.

677
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,920
Who's he?

678
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,640
Claims to be my disciple

679
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,880
but actually wants
to take my place.

680
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,920
He has a nice body.

681
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,760
Why don't you let him work with you?
He'll be of help.

682
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,000
Is his body better than mine?

683
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,680
Yours?

684
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,080
Ya, mine.

685
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,680
His body's better
than yours for sure.

686
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,600
My body's like Bruce Lee's.

687
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,240
- Do you want to see it?
- I do...

688
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,560
Show me. Yes.

689
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
Show me.

690
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,960
Should I?

691
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,080
What?

692
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,120
Hello.

693
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,480
It's me.

694
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
Where the hell were you?

695
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,960
Do you know how many
times I tried calling you?

696
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,720
My battery was dead.
I just charged it.

697
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,840
Listen, I am stuck here for a job.

698
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,040
I'll be back in a day or two.

699
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,120
Okay?

700
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,160
Girlfriend?

701
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,640
What can I say?

702
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,920
It's okay to have one.

703
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,400
Okay.

704
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,880
She works in the movies.

705
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,160
She's an actress?
Wow! You're lucky.

706
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,840
How is she?

707
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,320
A real back-breaker.

708
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,760
Better than mine?

709
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,880
Naah... Yours is different.

710
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,040
She's amazing.

711
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,320
Really amazing.

712
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,600
She's amazing?

713
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,400
Where's your drink?

714
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,680
He's one of us. Go get yours.

715
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,040
See...

716
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,680
Cheers!

717
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,200
You know, she sings really well.

718
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,200
No no... he's lying.

719
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,040
I'm not.

720
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,360
A peg or two down...

721
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,280
And she'll be crooning
like Lata Mangeshkar.

722
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,800
And after three.

723
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,360
She's Madhuri Dikshit.

724
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,600
The "Ek Don Teen" song.

725
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,280

- Yes.

807

and since then has raised

814
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,800
Is everything okay here?

815
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,960
Where's Triloki?

816
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,720
My brother left with the constables.

817
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,920
Which constables?!

818
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,720
What the fuck?!

819
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,200
They got him.
What are you blabbering?

820
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,056
They took him! What we thought
was a blast, were just firecrackers.

821
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,160
You motherfucker!

822
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,000
Are you here on duty or to
see your mother do a striptease?

823
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,840
If anything happens to him

824
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,520
I'll make you'll regret
you were even born.

825
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,880
Asshole.

826
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,280
Hello, Triloki.

827
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,680
You're so much in demand.

828
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,800
Now see, he wants to kill you,
and so do I.

829
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,880
Unbelievable.

830
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,280
Banke... Banke Bihari.

831
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,280
I'm the one who killed Sahay.

832
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,560
Enough with the introduction.

833
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,656
I am telling him because
this is the first time we've met.

834
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,720
Look Triloki, this is our job.
Our bread and butter.

835
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,600
Don't take it personally.

836
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,680
We cannot betray our profession.
We'll have to kill you.

837
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,040
Now it's up to you to choose,
at whose hands you wish to die.

838
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,120
His or mine. The choice is yours.

839
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,000
- What are you saying?
- What?

840
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,680
I abducted him,
so I get to kill him.

841
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,280
Did you do it alone?

842
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,936
And it's his choice,
who he feels should kill him.

843
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,920
But I bought these police uniforms.

844
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,960
So what? The plan was mine.

845
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,336
Doesn't matter who made the plan.

846
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,000
Who parked the cycle there? It was me.
Cycle...

847
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,600
I set the fuse...
Sir this is wrong.

848
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,120
I didn't know you'll
make such an issue of this.

849
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,840
Otherwise,
I would've never come with you.

850
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,960
Did I beg and give you
a hand job to come help me?

851
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,600
To hell with your game,
I don't want to play any game.

852
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,440
This is cheating.
Out and out cheating.

853
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,816
Do you want to cheat
and win the game?

854
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,560
Fine, kill him.

855
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,360
You know what... Let's do...

856
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,360
- What is it called?
- What?

857
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,760
Tea-breaker... what...

858
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,400
- Toss?
- No...

859
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,160
What's it called?

860
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,920
- Tea break...
- Tie-breaker.

861
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,080
Right, tie-breaker!

862
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,520
- Your English is good.
- Fine.

863
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,600
I'll shoot first.

864
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,240
What the...

865
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,960
Fine, go ahead you shoot first.
Okay.

866
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,560
Triloki... bye bye.

867
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,520
Banke...

868
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,120
Stop this!
You're ruining my reputation here.

869
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,200
You...

870
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,000
Bloody...

871
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,720
Banke... use your legs.

872
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,760
Your legs...
catch him with your legs!

873
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,480
Banke... use your legs.

874
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,200
Bravo. Bravo!

875
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,680
Banke!

876
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,120
You bastard, I won't spare you.

877
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,280
You've lost your chance. Get lost.
Your chance is over.

878
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:05,960
Your chance is over.

879
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,320
You can kill him if you want

880
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,160
but I am going to
first bust both his knees

881
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,360
and then his balls.

882
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,320
And then you can kill him.

883
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,960
What the fuck...

884
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,960
Kill me if you want,
just end this here.

885
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,000
Fine, fine we're going to kill you.
It takes time.

886
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,120
Let's shoot him together.

887
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,840
Wait... who will win the game?

888
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,680
Neither you nor me. It'll be a tie.

889
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,680
On three then, okay?

890
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,240
One... two...

891
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,960
At least let me finish counting.
No, Babu.

892
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,520
- One...
- No, Babu.

893
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,720
Two...

894
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
Three.

895
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,600
Look son, I did you a big favor

896
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,480
by letting you stay
in this profession.

897
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,280
But don't forget...

898
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,800
A mentor is always a mentor.

899
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,640
Don't ever try to cross my path.

900
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,560
But you will have quit
this profession, sir.

901
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,040
Because I won the game.

902
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:55,720
Bastard!

903
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,816
What do you mean I won
the game... I won the game...

904
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,240
You got 1½ and so did I.
It's a tie.

905
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,320
But the contract wasn't for three.
It was for four.

906
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,040
2½.

907
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,280
I won.

908
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,280
<i>2½... I win.</i>

909
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,000
Ticket.

910
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,720
Ticket.

911
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,960
I'll show you.

912
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,240
Cigarette?

913
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,840
Where's the bus depot?

914
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,240
You'll see Dubey Square
after four blocks.

915
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,560
Turn left from there.
It's right there.

916
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,160
Duby Chowk?

917
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,800
When did that get built?

918
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,160
You're new here?

919
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,800
When Dubey won his first election.

920
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,800
That was seven years ago.

921
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,240
Seven years?!

922
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,400
Put it on my tab.

923
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,440
Fuck!

924
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,720
You're still alive!

925
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,760
Where the fuck were you?

926
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,160
Arm-wrestling with death.

927
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,080
It took death seven
years to realize

928
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,480
I wasn't going
to be an easy prey.

929
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,800
Eight years...

930
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,400
It's been eight
years since you died.

931
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,680
How much is it?

932
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,240
Whatever it is, it's all I have.

933
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,800
Anyway...

934
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,200
It's better than
going home empty handed.

935
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,760
Is the bullet still inside?
I don't know...

936
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,240
But it feels like it.

937
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,280
No non-veg?

938
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,880
It's been 5 years.

939
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,560
She stopped making it.

940
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,720
I stopped eating it.

941
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,160
Pappu wouldn't eat
if there was no non-veg.

942
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,640
Oh yes... Where is he?
I don't see him.

943
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,600
He must have grown up now.

944
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,120
He died.

945
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,040
Five years ago.

946
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,680
There was an outbreak of Dengue.

947
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,600
Look at the irony of it.
I didn't get it, he didn't get it

948
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,800
and my son got it.

949
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,760
Like they say...

950
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,320
Man forgets the evil he does...

951
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,400
But karma doesn't...
it catches up with him one day.

952
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,240
I guess you two kept meeting,
didn't you?

953
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,520
How is Phulwa?

954
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,600
I said how is she?

955
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,680
Bloody bastards.

956
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,480
They even took the door.

957
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,640
Who did this?

958
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,520
It happened after
you killed Triloki.

959
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,040
God knows how Jiji found your home.

960
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,520
And that bastard Triveni...

961
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,840
He brought his gang with him.

962
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,680
Run from there,
from there, asshole!

963
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,480
<i>They set your home on fire
right in front of my eyes.</i>

964
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,920
<i>I was scared shit.</i>

965
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,120
<i>I just kept staring from afar.</i>

966
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,640
Couldn't do anything.

967
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,640

968
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:18,240

I've quoted three hundred thousand!

01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,640
It's a big job.

991
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,600
He'll pay at least
a hundred thousand each.

992
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,760
Do you really need
all that lipstick?

993
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,400
Your lips are naturally so red.

994
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,480
- Which one?
- Both.

995
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,080
You motherfucker!

996
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,640
- I'm leaving...
- Come here.

997
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,640
I'll tell you a secret...

998
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,680
Come...

999
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,240
You want a massage?

1000
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,280
Here, hold this.

1001
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,880
Guys, what happened?

1002
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,600
Come here...

1003
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,600
Come...

1004
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,560
Don't do that, sir.

1005
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,800
Don't kill me.

1006
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,496
I made a mistake,
please forgive me.

1007
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,680
Mistake...

1008
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,640
Your mistake was that
you couldn't kill me.

1009
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,840
I didn't want to kill you,
but what could I do?

1010
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,320
I was given your contract.

1011
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,280
I couldn't have
betrayed my profession.

1012
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,960
What would you have done?

1013
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:38,200
Hadn't you said exactly the
same thing when we killed Triloki?

1014
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,920
That you can't betray
your profession.

1015
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,120
I don't have any
personal enmity with you.

1016
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,760
I saved your life.

1017
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,400
Please spare my life
for old time's sake.

1018
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,680
Spare my life. I beg you...

1019
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,080
I beg you!

1020
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,800
They killed Phulwa.

1021
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,320
Burnt her alive.

1022
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,440
You spat out everything
in front of them. Like a wimp.

1023
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,280
Motherfucker why did
you tell them where I lived?

1024
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,840
Why would I tell
them where you lived?

1025
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,840
What did I stand to gain from it?

1026
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,520
You fucker, then who told them.

1027
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,120
Who gained from this?

1028
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,040
Who gained from all this?

1029
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,640
He did... he gave
them your whereabouts.

1030
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,200
He gained from it.

1031
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,360
He's the one...

1032
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,600
He gave me the contract to kill you.

1033
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,800
Dubey?

1034
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,000
You saved my life once.
So I'm sparing yours.

1035
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,840
But the next time
you cross my path...

1036
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,160
I won't give you the time to
speak nor myself the time to listen.

1037
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,856
If you're thinking about
killing those rascals

1038
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,320
then forget about it.
I will do it for you.

1039
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,160
I mean... I've got a contract.

1040
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,200
I swear...

1041
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,800
Sir! How about we play another game?
For old times sake...

1042
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,880
If you kill two out of three

1043
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,176
I won't just quit this
profession, but this city as well.

1044
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,120
And if I win...
then you must quit both.

1045
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,320
Say something...

1046
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,800
Sir...!

1047
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,280
Stop.

1048
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,240
You're still here?

1049
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,000
I was thinking about Babu.

1050
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:07,760
Should I stay back
tonight if you're scared?

1051
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,000
I'm not scared.

1052
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,200
Are you?

1053
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,840
<i>He's stubborn and he's mad.</i>

1054
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,200
<i>He's standing erect in
the storm with a lamp.</i>

1055
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,600
That's brilliant.

1056
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,280
- Standing erect...
- With a lamp.

1057
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,880
This is great. Wonderful.

1058
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,320
Come come Jiji...

1059
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,000
You must hear what
this boy's written.

1060
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,800
<i>Fire burns...</i>
Listen, my stomach is growling...

1061
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,160
I need to use the toilet.

1062
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,600
Of course... go ahead.

1063
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,200
Do come back again.

1064
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,200
My wife just loves poems like these.

1065
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,640
You must recite this one for here.

1066
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,640
Where's the mug
that used to be here?

1067
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,920
I had a nozzle installed, use that.

1068
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,880
You'll love the feel
of the water gushing.

1069
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,080
Give him your number.

1070
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,200
Go and flush.

1071
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,600
Are you okay?

1072
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,200
There's no news of
Triveni since morning.

1073
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,360
I'm really worried.

1074
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,600
I... saw Babu yesterday

1075
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,480
at the function.

1076
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,040
Babu?

1077
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,200
Babu Bihari.

1078
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,000
No wonder you have loose motions.

1079
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,680
Come on now... Babu's dead.

1080
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,040
Are you sure you didn't see a ghost?

1081
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,640
Triveni's body has been found...
burnt.

1082
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,680
Babu!

1083
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,360
1-0!

1084
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,920
So, 100,000's gone.

1085
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,480
Gopal, Murli...

1086
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,720
Papa's come...

1087
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,536
What's going on, huh!
What are you all up to...

1088
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,360
Papa...

1089
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,840
Papa, sweetmeat...

1090
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,240
Enough... enough...

1091
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,400
Papa, sweetmeat...

1092
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,720
Enough!

1093
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,440
Enough! Quiet. Take the sweetmeats,
come on now... go off.

1094
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,200
You guys drive me crazy.

1095
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,440
- Where's your mother?
- Inside.

1096
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,640
Meena...

1097
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,480
Meena!

1098
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,496
I bought your favorite... 'Rabadi'
and 'Jalebi' (Indian Sweets).

1099
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,520
Take it.

1100
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,360
I met my aunt this morning.

1101
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,840
She said my face has turned pale.

1102
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,440
And even this time
it's going to be a boy.

1103
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,920
Fuck your aunt.

1104
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,120
Who does she think she is?

1105
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,776
What she says doesn't matter!
But still...

1106
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,800
Bloody nonsense!

1107
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,200
If it's a boy again, I'll shoot...

1108
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,120
Your aunt.

1109
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,320
<i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i>

1110
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,680
<i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i>

1111
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,200
<i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i>

1112
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,440
Sumitra ma'am.

1113
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,280
Hello... Today's my lucky day...
tell me...

1114
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,800
I have a solution.

1115
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,280
Till Babu isn't arrested

1116
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,080
we'll go underground, in hiding.

1117
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,200
Doesn't matter where you hide,
he will find you.

1118
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,280
There's one place.

1119
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,656
No one can ever imagine
will be a hideout.

1120
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,680
Where?

1121
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:49,880
Jobanpura.

1122
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,560
Have you lost your mind?

1123
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,080
That's the red light area.

1124
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,600
So what?

1125
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,840
In fact you'll feel at home there.

1126
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,280
Safe.

1127
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,160
That must have been
your mother's home.

1128
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,640
I won't go to that brothel.

1129
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:05,600
Oh, and...

1130
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,200
You are scheduled to visit
the Naxalite (Extremists) area.

1131
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,520
Oh yes... that's important.

1132
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,120
You cannot cancel that.

1133
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,840
And if Babu shows up,
gun down the bastard.

1134
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,200
Do you think I'm an asshole?

1135
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,296
You want me to go
there alone to die?

1136
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,560
I'll be with you.

1137
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,720
What will he do?

1138
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,680
You think he can
kill you with me around?

1139
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,480
We'll go with security.

1140
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:29,760
Security...

1141
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,240
How the fuck will security stop him?

1142
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,720
Forget it, Dubey sir.

1143
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,440
She's scared shit.

1144
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,200
She's a woman after all.

1145
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,960
The best place for her is Jobanpura.

1146
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,920
Babu really won't
need to try hard

1147
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,560
if you stick your head
out like a sitting duck...

1148
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,400
Roll up the window!

1149
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,840
Don't step out.

1150
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,280
Don't step out!

1151
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,160
What happened?

1152
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,640
Who is it... who's shooting at them?
Is it Babu? - No

1153
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,040
I'm talking to you who was it?
Shut up!

1154
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,000
Bloody motherfucker.

1155
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,960
What happened to your security now?

1156
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,800
Shoved it up your arse?

1157
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,400
Big talk... that's all you do.

1158
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,880
Now why did you run off?

1159
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,880
- Bloody scoundrel.
- Shut up.

1160
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,800
Shut up or else
I'll smash your face.

1161
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,120
What did you say?

1162
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,440
What did you say?

1163
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,120
You'll smash my face?

1164
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,400
Motherfucker...

1165
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,720
Will smash my face! Bloody fucker! Asshole!
Stop it... stop this shit!

1166
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,640
How dare you?

1167
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,120
How dare you?

1168
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,560
You have a death wish?

1169
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,120
Get out!!

1170
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,680
Hit me.

1171
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,400
Come on hit me!

1172
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,960
Hit me!!

1173
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,880
Now my turn.

1174
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,520
If I knew, I would've
beaten the life out of you.

1175
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:55,720
Really!

1176
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,760
Haven't you beaten
me enough already?

1177
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,560
Tell me something...

1178
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,080
What do you put in your betel leaf?

1179
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,760
It smells so nice.

1180
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,520
Oh, my...

1181
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,800
What happened?

1182
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,400
Run, Sumitra.

1183
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:32,360
Run...

1184
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,480
For my sake. I won't leave you.

1185
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,800
Sumitra, run.

1186
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,120
Run!

1187
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,720
Come.

1188
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,280
Come, Jiji. Come.

1189
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,840
See what a scoundrel Dubey is.

1190
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,680
He betrayed you the
same way he betrayed me.

1191
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,240
Sheer betrayal.

1192
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:20,960
He took advantage of the situation,
killed one of your men.

1193
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,640
And then targeted you.

1194
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,856
No one can save him
once I get my hands on him.

1195
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,120
But where is he?
Hiding between his mother's legs?

1196
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,960
He's got an entire
battalion protecting him.

1197
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,040
You won't be able to get to him.

1198
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,640
Me? Ha!

1199
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,960
Jobanpura.

1200
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,160
He's hiding in Jobanpura.

1201
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,320
Babu...

1202
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,520
Babu...

1203
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,000
Babu, I beg you.

1204
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,456
Kill me if you want,
but not like this.

1205
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,760
Babu.

1206
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,840
Babu, you're like my brother.

1207
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,040
Babu, you call me your sister,
don't you.

1208
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,680
Babu, shoot me!
But don't leave me here.

1209
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,320
Babu, you motherfucker!

1210
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,880
You bloody bastard! Kill me.

1211
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,920
Babu, don't leave me here.

1212
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,120
Sumitra.

1213
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:57,680
Sumitra.

1214
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,400
Where in hell are you?

1215
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,960
What happened to you?

1216
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,120
- He shot me.
- Who?

1217
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,200
Me.

1218
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,000
And who brought him here?

1219
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,400
I did.

1220
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,640
What if the fucker had died?

1221
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,520
There should be someone
who carries my name forward.

1222
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,520
What?

1223
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,200
Nothing.

1224
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,400
One's an asshole.
The other one's a bigger asshole.

1225
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,840
Great. I need a drink.

1226
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,800
Is he going to marry you?

1227
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,960
Marry me?

1228
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,760
Why? Will you?

1229
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,480
Who's Phulwa?

1230
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,840
Why?

1231
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,000
You were repeatedly taking her name.

1232
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,560
So I asked.

1233
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,800
How long have you known Banke?

1234
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,960
Since I was 12.

1235
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,400
He lived in my neighborhood.

1236
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,960
Did his first job for me.

1237
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:20,000
For free... all I had to do was ask.

1238
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,160
But he told me
he got 2000 for his first job.

1239
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,760
Bloody liar.

1240
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,560
Who did you ask him to kill?

1241
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,400
Me?

1242
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,800
My father's brother.

1243
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,640
<i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i>

1244
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,880
<i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i>

1245
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,000
<i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i>

1246
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,640
Yes...

1247
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,280
Huh... is it paining a lot?

1248
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,560
Listen Gopal... you have
the doctor's number, don't you?

1249
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,440
Yes... call her.

1250
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,080
Yes, yes, the same one...

1251
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,400
And call your mother's aunt.
Call her.

1252
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,800
And listen... Listen, son.

1253
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,640
I won't be able to come home soon

1254
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:25,240
so take care of your
mother and let me know.

1255
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,480
I'll try to get home really soon.

1256
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,280
Yes, take care.

1257
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,480
No-no, Sir...

1258
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,920
Not that one!

1259
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,760
That one's my favorite.
Take any other.

1260
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,560
Here, shove it up your arse.

1261
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,240
Why are you taking such a big risk?

1262
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,616
The fucker will come
out of hiding someday.

1263
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,720
We'll kill him them.

1264
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,440
I'll go into his
hideout and shoot him.

1265
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,320
You don't have the balls
go get your arse stitched.

1266
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,280
You've already lost the game.
It's 2-0.

1267
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:04,120
Now it will be 3-0... whitewash!

1268
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,400
Where is he?

1269
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,560
On the phone with his wife.

1270
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:44,000
Yes... more-more...

1271
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,960
More.

1272
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,600
Fucking over the phone!
Unbelievable!

1273
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:48,960
More.

1274
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,720
Mr. Dubey.

1275
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,200
Mr. Dubey.

1276
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,720
That was my wife on the line.

1277
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,040
I was telling her about Jiji.

1278
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,720
I want to tell you something too.

1279
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,680
Babu wasn't alone.

1280
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,800
- Banke was with him.
- Banke?

1281
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,320
What was he doing there?

1282
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,800
That's exactly what I want to know.

1283
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,000
What was he doing there?

1284
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,320
He's one of your men, isn't he?

1285
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,160
Hell will break loose today.

1286
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:44,440
Yes Meena.
God has finally answered your prayers.

1287
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,960
It's a girl.

1288
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,480
- Really?
- Did you hear her?

1289
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,880
Who does she look like?
I mean... how does she look?

1290
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,520
She looks just like you.

1291
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,920
What?

1292
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,240
Really?

1293
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,040
I have a daughter.

1294
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,360
God bless her.

1295
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,920
See Ansari, that's Osama Bin Laden.

1296
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,320
Who was made by America

1297
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,080
and later, he turned
around and screwed America.

1298
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,880
Our story's quite the same...

1299
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,120
But with a different end.

1300
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,800
Here, Osama's going to fuck America.
And get away with it.

1301
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,320
I admit I made a mistake.

1302
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,040
I... I shouldn't have
told Jiji where you lived.

1303
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:39,600
But what could I do? She insisted.

1304
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
She wanted to avenge
Triloki's death.

1305
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:47,320
At first,
I refused to tell her anything.

1306
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:53,160
It was only after I heard you were
dead, Babu... that I told her...

1307
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:56,040
Doesn't matter whether
you told her before or after.

1308
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,960
Phulwa's died.

1309
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,280
Phulwa?!

1310
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,600
You gave a contract for me... fine.

1311
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,520
But why Phulwa?

1312
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:07,800
Phulwa was...

1313
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,640
This one's for Phulwa.

1314
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,920
You shouldn't have done that.

1315
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,960
What was her fault?

1316
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,240
You got her killed.

1317
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,360
That's enough, now get out.

1318
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,520
What are you looking at?

1319
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:43,360
He's the one who gave me
the contract... for these three.

1320
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,520
Why did you kill Phulwa?

1321
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,600
You won't get paid for this one.

1322
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,600
Babu killed him.
Have you lost your mind?

1323
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,280
I shot him first.

1324
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:00,320
Or I'll shoot you as well.

1325
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,080
I've risked my life to do your job.

1326
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:22,000
Okay listen, I am going home.

1327
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:24,680
I have spoken to Ansari.

1328
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,800
You'll get the money within a week.

1329
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:28,960
A week?

1330
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,280
Does it take a week
to pay a hundred thousand?

1331
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,400
Three hundred thousand.

1332
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,480
I've told him to
pay the entire amount.

1333
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,160
But will he pay three
hundred thousand?

1334
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,880
Of course the fucker will pay.

1335
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,520
The job was worth that much.
Yes, but...

1336
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,040
I'm coming back on Sunday.
Let's talk then.

1337
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,280
Fine.

1338
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,640
A hundred thousand.
What do you say?

1339
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,080
Your offer's tempting.

1340
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,720
But I've decided to quit.

1341
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:09,960
You'll change your mind
when you hear the name.

1342
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,960
Banke.

1343
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,160
Do you think I'm like Banke?

1344
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,496
I won't make the same
fucking mistake he made.

1345
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,600
Whether you offer me a
hundred thousand or a million.

1346
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:27,080
- I won't kill Banke.
- You will.

1347
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,680
You'll definitely kill Banke.

1348
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,400
Why did you lie to me?

1349
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,800
You took all my savings.

1350
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:51,720
I thought this way I
could make some quick money.

1351
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,480
I asked him for 50...

1352
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:56,920
I thought he'll bargain,
but he gave me 55 instead.

1353
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,960
You look so different.

1354
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:57,920
Look at you all dressed up...

1355
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,000
Like a complete woman.

1356
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,240
Nice home too.

1357
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,160
Bed.

1358
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,080
Fresh paint.

1359
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,400
Everything neatly arranged.

1360
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:30,640
Remember, when we had gone
to the market once... shopping?

1361
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,360
Remember?
There, a store had had a scheme

1362
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,960
exchange old for new.
You remember don't you.

1363
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,920
That's exactly what you did with me.

1364
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,880
When you are bored with him...

1365
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,320
Will you exchange him too?

1366
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,520
I love her.

1367
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,320
Didn't I love her?

1368
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:03,160
I loved her the way I knew to love.

1369
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:06,400
And you had me killed.

1370
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,520
Look, papa.

1371
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,120
You were out playing marbles again!

1372
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:30,280
Go wash yourself you're a mess!

1373
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,040
I'll throw all your marbles.

1374
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,560
So many marbles.

1375
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,160
Did you win them all?

1376
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,680
- Ya?
- Yes.

1377
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:48,360
Then you must have a good aim.

1378
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,600
I did too.

1379
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,480
Which one should I hit?

1380
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,600
This one?

1381
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,160
See...

1382
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:59,800
I taught these two.

1383
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:02,600
Didn't you hear what I said?

1384
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,920
Go wash yourself!

1385
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,760
If you had me killed

1386
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,760
you should've aborted
my child as well.

1387
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,280
You took away everything from me.

1388
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,200
Why did you do this to me?

1389
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,360
Phulwa, where are you?

1390
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,920
What happened yesterday
can never happen again.

1391
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,440
It's not right.

1392
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I'm leaving.

1393
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:05,920
I'll be back when the job's done.

1394
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:08,760
Where's the asshole?

1395
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,800
When do I see you next?

1396
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,960
I don't know when
I'll get the chance.

1397
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,480
And what do we do till then?

1398
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,720
If you love me, let's run away.

1399
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:33,160
Are you crazy?
He'll find us and kill us.

1400
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,080
Even our bodies won't be found.

1401
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:41,560
No worries, anything for you.

1402
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:49,080
Where the hell are you?

1403
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,280
Listen...

1404
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,440
if I give you a contract
to kill someone...

1405
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,520
Will you do it?

1406
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,960
Can you do it?

1407
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,760
How did he find our house?

1408
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:30,560
Must have been your girlfriend
who told him.

1409
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,040
Again the same shit?

1410
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:35,240
Why are you dragging her into this?

1411
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:37,720
You can't let go of her, can you?

1412
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:41,720
I told you to kill him.

1413
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,800
Can't do a single job right.

1414
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,520
I shot him in the head.

1415
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:51,240
He survived.
What more was I supposed to do?

1416
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:53,320
Shoot him again.

1417
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:54,840
Shoot him again!

1418
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,520
I shot him once and couldn't sleep
peacefully for 8 years.

1419
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,000
How could I shoot him again?

1420
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,680
Now he'll put you to sleep forever.

1421
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,200
And me too.

1422
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,120
Come...

1423
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,520
Does he go to school?

1424
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:19,920
We've got him admitted
but he's not keen on studying.

1425
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,080
Plays marbles all day.

1426
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,880
What's his name?

1427
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,280
Abhishek.

1428
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,720
Abhishek. (Indian actor)

1429
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:32,960
We were thinking of naming
him Hrithik. (Indian actor)

1430
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:36,680
But Abhishek is her
favorite and mine too.

1431
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:38,880
So we named him Abhishek.

1432
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,200
Abhishek is your favorite?

1433
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:43,760
What are you saying?
I never knew.

1434
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,440
Did you ever have the time to know?

1435
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:51,560
Here.

1436
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,480
Take him inside.
We need to talk.

1437
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,240
Whatever it is,
say it in front of me.

1438
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,560
Don't be stubborn.

1439
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:58,720
Take him inside.

1440
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,680
I said say what you
have to say in front of me!

1441
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:03,080
I'm going to shoot him.
Should I shoot him in front of you?

1442
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,120
Let's play one last game.

1443
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,480
Load a bullet and
shuffle the chamber.

1444
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,360
Let's see who destiny favors.

1445
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:25,880
Whoever wins lives,
and whoever dies is the loser.

1446
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,200
Do you agree?

1447
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,720
What kind of game is this?

1448
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,240
Agree!

1449
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,600
But this time if you die

1450
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:38,800
your blood won't be on my hands.

1451
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:42,160
I forgive you my death.
You have my word.

1452
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:44,000
On three then...

1453
01:51:58,280 --> 01:51:59,400
One...

1454
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,840
Two...

1455
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,400
Three...!

1456
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,880
Really, sir?

1457
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:42,000
You know, you learnt to
do everything the way I did

1458
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:45,360
learnt everything but this

1459
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:49,600
this trick of
shuffling chambers.

1460
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,160
You could never learn it,
could you?

1461
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:59,720
The bullet should come back
to the same place. Like this.

1462
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,920
Understood?

1463
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:08,560
No worries

1464
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,560
anything for you...

1465
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,160
