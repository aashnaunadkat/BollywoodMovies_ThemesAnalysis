00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,701
<b>'DDR'</b>

2
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,682
Gosh, your obsession with skiing!

3
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,713
I have only two vices.

4
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,283
What's the other one?

5
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,051
You!

6
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,100
So, you're going to
climb up that mountain to ski?

7
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,695
Up.. then down.. and
then up again.

8
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,737
Nope!

9
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,297
Our resort is on that mountain.

10
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,870
I'll be going further ahead to ski.

11
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,267
Higher up.

12
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,272
No more skiing vacations
after we get married.

13
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,678
After the wedding, our vacations
will be something else altogether.

14
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,121
How come?

15
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,723
Wait and watch.

16
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:52,735
I'll become the rain,
you'll become the clouds.

17
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,210
Wait and watch..

18
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,582
Wait and watch..

19
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:05,314
I'll love you so much
that you'll go crazy.

20
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,956
Wait and watch..

21
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,957
Wait and watch..

22
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:19,030
The rays of the
morning sun declare..

23
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:23,937
...I'm yours in every respect.

24
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,634
Wait and watch..

25
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:33,707
I'll forever be
the smile on your lips.

26
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,653
Wait and watch..

27
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,120
Wait and watch..

28
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,351
When your eyes turn moist.

29
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,963
...l'll flow from them,
wait and watch.

30
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,680
Everybody has a heart.

31
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,743
But mine is full of love..

32
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:14,349
...more than all others,
wait and watch.

33
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:22,296
I'll carve you
in the lines of my fate.

34
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:27,804
It's my promise to you,
wait and watch.

35
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:34,837
The rays
of the morning sun declare..

36
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,916
...I'm yours in every respect.

37
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,249
Wait and watch..

38
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,388
I'll forever be
the smile on your lips.

39
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,929
Wait and watch..

40
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,925
Wait and watch..

41
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,103
When your eyes turn moist.

42
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:04,765
...l'll flow from them,
wait and watch.

43
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,017
Yes, dad?

44
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,292
Has Amar returned?

45
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,154
No, dad.

46
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,030
The weather's getting worse too.

47
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,358
I'm his father.

48
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,095
I've put up with his
habits since he was a kid.

49
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,105
Now it's your turn.

50
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,210
I'm a little scared now, dad.

51
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,478
I'll call you later.

52
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,208
Ok.

53
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,596
It's just a stupid mountain.
Why can't they find him?

54
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,073
Though he doesn't say it,
but dad's worried too.

55
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,571
Taran, don't worry.
It's Amar after all.

56
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,140
You know him, nah!

57
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,541
He may come late,
but he'll definitely come.

58
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,058
Papa..

59
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,696
No need to worry, Manpreet.
He will come back.

60
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,691
Where else will he go?

61
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,524
Yeah, of course. Where can he go?

62
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,027
I am going only because
Taran's all alone out there.

63
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,533
See you.
Ok, call me.

64
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,662
Yes. I will.

65
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,633
Ok. Bye.

66
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:27,621
We were together, we were close.

67
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:33,431
I wonder where our
paths separated.

68
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:39,272
The place where no path goes..

69
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:44,575
...that's the one you chose.

70
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:56,118
We were together, we were close.

71
00:11:56,248 --> 00:12:02,221
I wonder where our paths separated.

72
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:07,566
But a place where no path goes..

73
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,668
...that's the one you chose.

74
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:19,145
O beloved, living without you..

75
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:24,120
...every breath pricks my heart.

76
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:33,287
Without you.. I cannot exist.

77
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:44,564
Without you.. I cannot live.

78
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:55,243
Without you.. I cannot exist.

79
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:06,488
Without you.. I cannot live.

80
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,341
Nine days we've searched,
we looked everywhere.

81
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:38,291
If..If we find the body,
we will call you.

82
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,292
For now, I suggest you go home.

83
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,264
I am so very sorry, he must be dead.

84
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:16,851
Alas! This daily dilemma
that refuses to die down.

85
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:28,395
As if something very dear,
has been misplaced and forgotten.

86
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,754
You were here..

87
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,620
Yes, right here..

88
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,924
...but now you're lost.

89
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:51,631
O beloved, living without you..

90
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,434
...every breath pricks my heart.

91
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:05,306
Without you.. I cannot exist.

92
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:16,418
Without you.. I cannot live.

93
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:52,721
Without you.. I cannot live.

94
00:15:54,687 --> 00:16:02,504
Without you.. I cannot live.

95
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:11,873
It seems, without you..

96
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:17,510
...I can't live anymore.

97
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:23,423
The shattered pieces within..

98
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:28,760
...I cannot explain.

99
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,901
Come back now..

100
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:39,469
Why nurse a grudge against me?

101
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:46,346
O beloved, living without you..

102
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:51,080
...every breath pricks my heart.

103
00:16:51,443 --> 00:17:00,420
Without you.. I cannot exist.

104
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:11,733
Without you.. I cannot live.

105
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:22,851
Without you.. I cannot exist.

106
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:34,691
Without you.. I cannot live.

107
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,107
When you feel like crying,
cry out loud.

108
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,911
And when you feel love, give a hug.

109
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,488
These are the only
two realities of life.

110
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,528
Years later..

111
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,624
...I went to office today.

112
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,228
Got some work done too.

113
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:52,803
In the beginning, when I started the
gallery there were many instances..

114
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,641
...when I thought I might
have to shut down the gallery.

115
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,041
Thank you, papa.

116
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,613
Like it often happens in any business.

117
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,952
But it's been 30 years now.

118
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,588
The gallery is still up and running.

119
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,653
Nothing stops.

120
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,099
...if it's done with a good intention.

121
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,157
That's enough, thank you.

122
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,596
How is it?

123
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,843
Delicious, like always.

124
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,244
For 6 months, I sat
alone in this house..

125
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,653
...and thought about Amar.

126
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,917
Sometimes I would cry.

127
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,890
As a kid,
when he was just learning to walk..

128
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,994
...he would often fall down,
like all kids do.

129
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:01,676
I would rush to pick him up,
as if I had hum myself.

130
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,249
And Urvashi would laugh at me.

131
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,683
She would say, 'let him fall'.

132
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:15,150
'He'll learn to walk..
..and to deal with his pain.'

133
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,288
I would often quarrel with her.

134
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,754
Saying-

135
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,961
'We can at least
save him some of the pain'.

136
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,801
But she was very sensible.

137
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,265
Do you know what she would say?

138
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,180
'Every life has its
own share of pain.'

139
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,217
'The sooner you learn to conquer it,
the better.'

140
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,350
'How long do you
think you can help him?'

141
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,787
She was right.

142
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,993
For three months, she battled
with her pain in the hospital.

143
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,739
I couldn't save her from her pain.

144
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,812
And I couldn't save
Amar from his pain either.

145
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:22,957
Anyway..

146
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,990
...he must have dealt with his pain.

147
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,860
We need to deal with
our pain too, dear.

148
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,797
I've thought of something, dear.

149
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,116
Look dear..

150
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,095
...we can either keep crying
for years to come and wait for him.

151
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,837
Weave thousands of stories,
saying, 'maybe this..or maybe that'.

152
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,469
Or we can admit the truth.

153
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,842
Admit the truth, dear.

154
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,079
I've already given
up all hope regarding Amar.

155
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,861
That's what I called
to tell you, dear.

156
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,261
And I wanted to request
you personally, dear..

157
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:17,899
...that let us together, let Amar go.

158
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,968
Let him go.

159
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:27,441
He was supposed to be
with us for only this long.

160
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,771
Hi, dad.

161
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:50,829
Come, son.

162
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,276
I thought I'll take you out.

163
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,213
Come, dear.

164
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,919
This is Taran.

165
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,045
Shekhar.

166
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,143
Hi.
Hi.

167
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,950
I'll take your leave now, father.

168
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,190
You didn't bring your car.
Shall I call a cab?

169
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,198
No, papa. I brought my cycle.

170
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:17,923
Can I drop you?

171
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,166
No thank you.
I'll really be fine, papa.

172
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,064
Okay.

173
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,583
See you, Papa.

174
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,074
Bye.
Bye.

175
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:34,995
All hope, all desires seem
to have vanished in thin air..

176
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:46,106
All hope, all desires seem
to have vanished in thin air..

177
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:57,517
As if your unfulfilled
desire lies buried in me..

178
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:08,328
As if a lifetime has
passed while I lay awake..

179
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:19,639
As if a lifetime has
passed while I lay awake..

180
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:31,251
All hope, all desires seem
to have vanished in thin air..

181
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:09,333
Enough, Gurpreet.

182
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,270
No girl from our family
is going to Pakistan.

183
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,670
Who's going to Pakistan?
He lives right here in Edinburgh.

184
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,373
But he's a Pakistani after all.

185
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,275
But I like him.

186
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,572
You even liked that stupid guy.

187
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,742
What was his name, Taran?
Randy.

188
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,140
Enough, whether he's
Pakistani or Afganistani.

189
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,982
You won't find someone like him.

190
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,383
You should be worrying about
yourself, I've plenty of options.

191
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,252
I see..

192
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,022
Then what about him?

193
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,150
He's too cute.

194
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,720
By the way, my guy isn't just cute.

195
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,467
He's good looking too.

196
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,258
I said no means no. Twisty.

197
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,028
Don't call me Twisty.

198
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,332
You're always hitting me.

199
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,635
Twisty. Let's see you escape today.

200
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,107
Take that. And that.

201
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,200
Move.. Move..

202
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,235
Take that.

203
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,570
Twisty! Twisty!

204
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,085
Hi, papa.
- Hello, papa!

205
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,316
Hi.

206
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,548
This is how life should be..happy.

207
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,387
Hello, papa.
Hello, dear.

208
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,588
I am sorry, but I brought
a guest along uninformed.

209
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,724
He's the son of my friend.

210
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,364
His father passed away.

211
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,732
Since then he's been lonely,
always wandering around.

212
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,470
How are you, dear?
Fine.

213
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,608
Come, Shekhar.

214
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:21,702
Hi!

215
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,774
Meet the charming Kaurs.

216
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,575
Manpreet, the eldest of the lot.

217
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,739
Hi.
Hi.

218
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,210
Gurpreet.
Hi.

219
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,680
Taran.
Taran, of course.

220
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,513
Hi, Taran.

221
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,053
- You've met her.
Yes.

222
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,449
And this is Navjot.

223
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,656
For the past three
years, he's convinced..

224
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,785
...that he'll marry Manpreet.

225
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,458
It was Manpreet's birthday yesterday.

226
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:42,730
But we've been invited
to dinner today.

227
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:43,526
I see..

228
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,234
Wish you a belated happy birthday.
Thank you.

229
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,828
Sorry, I didn't know.
I showed up empty-handed.

230
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,228
I owe you a gift.

231
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:51,830
Not at all, please.

232
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,208
Have a seat.

233
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,241
Take a seat everyone.

234
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,336
I'll finish up first
and then we can chat.

235
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,242
Yeah..

236
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,140
I've already finished my chores.

237
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,216
I'll be done with mine in 10 minutes.

238
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,110
Navjot and Taran,
you guys go get the cake.

239
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,711
Let me first pour papa a drink.
Then we can go.

240
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,087
Can I go get the cake?

241
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,792
And you guys can finish up by then.

242
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,223
Actually, I'll come along too.

243
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,655
These guys are such drama-queens.

244
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:14,819
They're very choosy about the flavour.

245
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,791
No-no..what are you saying, Gurpreet?

246
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,498
How can our guest go get the cake?

247
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,259
A guest should get a gift too.

248
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,697
Come, Gurpreet.
No-No, I am pretty much done here.

249
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,499
I'll go get it.

250
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,098
I haven't done any cycling today,
I'll go get it.

251
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,368
I'll order one.

252
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,443
This way we'll have five cakes.

253
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,147
Actually, I can bake
a cake in 15 minutes.

254
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,745
That way we'll all stay at home
we'll have the cake.

255
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,715
...and it'll be my gift to you.

256
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,616
Ohh, so sweet.

257
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,482
But please,
no need for such formalities.

258
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,417
I am going to invade your kitchen.

259
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,588
And you're speaking about formality.

260
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,690
Well I'll need an assistant.
Gurpreet, would you mind helping me?

261
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:48,756
Sure.

262
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,565
The blender's here, fantastic.

263
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,273
Gurpreet,
chop these fruits please.

264
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:58,830
Sure.

265
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,199
Manpreet, can you pass me that bowl?

266
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,273
Thank you.

267
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,410
I also need some flour
and some baking powder.

268
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,778
Sure.
Thank you.

269
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,223
By the way..

270
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,761
...l've an old association
with the name Gurpreet.

271
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:21,923
Meaning?

272
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,667
My best friend when
I was a kid.. was Gurpreet.

273
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,493
We would call him Guru.

274
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,293
He went to India.

275
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,540
Later, on my first trip to New York..

276
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,366
...the name of my first
taxi driver was Gurpreet.

277
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,938
And you won't believe this.

278
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,770
When I was returning from New York..

279
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,275
...my taxi-driver to the airport,
was another Gurpreet.

280
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,443
And just see this..

281
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,345
There are seven Gurpreets
in my phone diary.

282
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,618
Seven.

283
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:47,950
My last girlfriend's dad..

284
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,848
Sardar Gurpreet Singh Dhillon.

285
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,852
Thank God for him.
If it wasn't for him..

286
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,360
...I would've been married by now.

287
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,559
But it's unbelievable.

288
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,731
All seven Gurpreets were men.

289
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,261
Oh really!

290
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,867
Until 10 minutes ago, I thought
only guys name can be Gurpreet.

291
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,810
Here are your fruits and your knife.

292
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:14,916
Make it yourself.

293
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,375
- I haven't finished yet.
What?

294
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,946
After meeting you today, I felt..

295
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,781
Only girls should be called Gurpreet.

296
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,228
Whatever.

297
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,461
Thank you.
Take some more.

298
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,627
Thank you, sir.

299
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,837
Manpreet, the food is fabulous.
Thank you.

300
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,541
You should taste Manpreet's
kidney-beans and rice.

301
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,610
- It's out of this world.
Is it?

302
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,414
So Shekhar.

303
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,848
Yeah.
How long do you plan to stay here?

304
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,610
Don't know.

305
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,724
Honestly, I don't know.

306
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,390
And anyway I believe,
we never decide the time.

307
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:04,832
Life does.

308
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:06,892
We just pretend.

309
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,776
One day, papa passed away suddenly.

310
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,349
He wasn't that old or sick.

311
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,982
One day he was leaving for office..

312
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,419
I was having my breakfast.

313
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,881
He turned around and said bye.
I saw..

314
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,724
...something unusual.

315
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,587
But before I could ask.. he..

316
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,398
...just collapsed.

317
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,334
We had..

318
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,035
...so many plans together.

319
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:50,938
Some for the next vacation,
some for 20 years later.

320
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,041
Later, I decided
I won't plan anything.

321
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,351
Just take life as it comes.

322
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,685
I see life..differently.

323
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:11,028
Remember how your cousins would
come home during summer vacations.

324
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,532
We would make plans at night.

325
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,638
We would plan 14 days
of fun in just 7 days.

326
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,340
We'll do this..we'll do that.

327
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,511
And then one day..vacations
would get over.

328
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,858
Everyone would go back to their homes.

329
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,654
That's how life is..

330
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,789
Ends suddenly..like summer vacations.

331
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:48,466
We make plans for many
lifetimes in one lifetime.

332
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,003
And then cry over
things we couldn't do.

333
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,510
I still do things that papa liked.

334
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,073
He's always around me.

335
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,078
Sometimes as papa,
sometimes as Gurpreet.

336
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,086
Sometimes he's
warm..sometimes furious.

337
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,420
And sometimes.

338
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,832
...he just watches me sleep all night.

339
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,132
I never stop myself.

340
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:24,734
I just embrace happiness
wherever I get it.

341
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,073
Because who knows..

342
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,770
...when the vacations might end.

343
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,139
You're absolutely right.

344
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,874
Nice thought.

345
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,085
'Life is a summer vacation.'

346
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,714
Here! Your cake's ready.

347
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,819
Let's see this.

348
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:48,829
We'll know when we see it.

349
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,125
Bravo.

350
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,668
Let me help you.
Yes.

351
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,760
Facing down?
Yes.

352
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,473
We'll soon find out.

353
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,440
Happy birthday, Manpreet.

354
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,675
Thank you so much.
happy birthday.

355
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:03,943
Make a wish.

356
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:05,576
Okay.

357
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,210
Happy birthday to you.

358
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,850
Happy birthday to you.

359
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,125
Happy birthday dear Manpreet.

360
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,826
Happy birthday to you.

361
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,030
Thank you.

362
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,525
Not bad.

363
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,228
Taran, I think you've found
the consultant for your patisserie.

364
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,838
- Seriously, it's really nice.
Thank you.

365
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,646
Taran and I,
we're starting a patisserie.

366
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,712
You will be our consultant.

367
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,179
No-no, very bad choice.

368
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,480
Why?

369
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,211
I only know
how to make few things.

370
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,584
But a very dear friend of my,
Francois.

371
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,622
He runs the best patisserie in London.

372
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,491
Come along,
and I'll introduce you to him.

373
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,923
And he'll give you the best advice,
and that's for sure.

374
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:06,635
O beloved..

375
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:14,066
Life has offers both
happiness and cure.

376
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:25,144
What do I do..
my heart grieves for you.

377
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:36,522
As if, every breath of
mine chants your name.

378
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:52,711
As if, every breath of mine
chants your name.

379
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,786
Taran, it was a pleasure meeting you.

380
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,919
Be ready, and I'll see you at 10.

381
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,259
Sure.

382
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,091
Manpreet, can I give you a hug please.

383
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,294
Of course.

384
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,797
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

385
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,733
- Keep coming as long as you're here.
I will.

386
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,682
Shekhar.

387
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,355
Shekhar.

388
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:35,990
God..

389
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,623
Hi. Good morning.

390
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,892
I've been calling you for so long.

391
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,800
I thought I'll turn
around when the song's over.

392
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,137
Very funny.

393
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,233
It was hard to notice the headphones.

394
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:47,899
You're up early.

395
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,702
- We didn't sleep all night.
I see.

396
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,771
The three of us were
chatting all night.

397
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,378
And brother Navjot.

398
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,014
He doesn't live with us.

399
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,787
He just comes over sometimes.

400
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,920
His father is quiet old.
So he feels lonely.

401
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:08,091
- That's sweet of him.
- Yeah, he's really sweet.

402
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:10,888
Coffee?

403
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:11,726
Okay.

404
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:12,391
Come.

405
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,866
She thought she loved me.

406
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,333
But she didn't?

407
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,140
No, she did.
Then?

408
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,344
Then she found it.
Who?

409
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,742
What she always wanted.
Then who were you?

410
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,882
She just loved me.

411
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,776
That's esoteric.

412
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,311
It's practical.

413
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,816
Sugar?
No.

414
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,959
Between our desires
and our choices in life..

415
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:44,856
...lies our weakness.. ..or our strength.

416
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,006
That's even more esoteric.

417
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,375
And now?

418
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,441
No love or anything
of that son until 2019.

419
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,840
Just free as a bird.

420
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,144
Why 2019?

421
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,441
Just like that.

422
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,329
Hi. Morning.
Hi.

423
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,442
Wow. So you'll open the
door and all for me, huh?

424
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:33,881
That's my dad.

425
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:37,441
He would teach me about chivalry
and respecting women since I was nine.

426
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,251
And he even managed to
imbibe some of the habits in me.

427
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,028
Shall we get something
for you for the road?

428
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,999
Some coffee sandwiches.
It's a long drive.

429
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,433
No-no, I am good.

430
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,274
By the way, what do you do?

431
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,976
I mean..what do you want to do?

432
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,786
Me..l travel.

433
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,983
Meet people.. see new places..

434
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,123
But, mostly alone.

435
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,765
I mean professionally, what do you..

436
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,499
Professionally.. sorry..

437
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:32,303
You see Taran, about 6
years ago I had a Chinese friend.

438
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:33,537
Zhi.

439
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:38,844
He had a financial mind..and
I was the software kind.

440
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,346
So together we designed an app.

441
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,982
We had a small office, in a garage.

442
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,151
Just the two of us.

443
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,014
Soon it grew bigger..

444
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,792
We had around 20-25
people working for us.

445
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:58,933
I always thought we can work
harder and expand the company.

446
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,828
But one day Zhi..made
a deal on the company.

447
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,270
The money offered was huge,
so we thought.

448
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,038
Doesn't matter how much
money you were offered..

449
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,842
- ..You worked hard to build that company..
- 62 million Dollars.

450
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,284
We each got 30-30.

451
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,887
- 62 million Dollars?
Yeah.

452
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,887
Then why work?

453
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,458
Exactly.

454
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,222
But no..l wanted to work.

455
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,558
But Zhi said let's
take a break for few years.

456
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,959
And we'll Stan something new in 2019.

457
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,301
What is so special about 2019?

458
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,140
I guess Gurpreet's told you a lot.

459
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,116
Why did you love Amar?

460
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,121
What do you mean?
I mean..

461
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:06,330
I want to know why someone
loves a person so much.

462
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,129
I don't know.

463
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,207
You know..like he was a pan of me.

464
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,275
A pan of my body.. pan of my soul.

465
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,914
If I can separate him from myself..

466
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,518
...then maybe I can
think why I loved him?

467
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,182
I guess..love isn't reasonable.

468
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,652
It's beyond reason.

469
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,097
Beautiful.

470
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:43,903
Listen to me, right.

471
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,138
Shekhar, oh my God!

472
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,438
Come here you..

473
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,212
And this beautiful lady, Taron..

474
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,341
Taran.
Taran.

475
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,207
Come here. Come here.

476
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,152
So this is my boyfriend, Daniel.

477
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,179
Nice to meet you.
I know, right.

478
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,950
You know, I used to have
a crush on him back in college.

479
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,927
But he's so grossly heterosexual.

480
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,528
And boring. So..

481
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,094
You show him the cakes.
Only the cakes.

482
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,395
And you and I Taran,
we're going to have a chat. Okay.

483
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,560
Yeah.
Come on.

484
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,999
Okay.
so, What are We trying today?

485
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,338
Francoise says you might
like some of the carrot cake.

486
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,969
I was going to cut you a slice,
if that's okay.

487
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,308
Please do that.
Okay.

488
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:26,946
Try..

489
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,380
Good choice, no?

490
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:37,055
So darling, you want to open up
a pattisserie, don't you?

491
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,056
This is a very, very, very hard..

492
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,432
I never, never helped anyone.

493
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,999
Because nobody helped me, so I
don't do this. But he vouched for you.

494
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,162
So I..

495
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,300
I will help you.

496
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,609
And That is..
- So..set!

497
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,104
I will help you..

498
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,511
...but you've to do it together.

499
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,675
And you've to do it
with your heart, okay?

500
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,418
Yes, I will.
Okay.

501
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,512
So, you let me know
if you change your mind.

502
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,056
I will let you know
if I change my mind.

503
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:11,683
Liar.

504
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:12,557
Bye.

505
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:13,752
Bye, I'll see you.

506
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,497
- Bye Daniel, I'll see you.
Bye.

507
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:19,161
I feel like taking to
the skies and tell everyone.

508
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,438
You see Taran, the time that
will take us to get to the airport.

509
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,266
Amar!

510
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,253
I was happy.

511
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,516
Maybe I would've told him first,
if he was alive.

512
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,389
The first person you
think of in a happy moment.

513
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,794
...is the most valuable
person in their life.

514
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,629
You know..

515
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,565
Most people turn their back on life.

516
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:13,238
Actually..we're used
to carrying our past.

517
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,616
And no matter how many
options life sends our way..

518
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,479
...we don't see them.

519
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:23,289
There can never be an option
for someone we love, Shekhar.

520
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,517
Of course not.

521
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,557
How can there be an option for humans?

522
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:28,863
Then?

523
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:31,264
What do you want from life?

524
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,596
Just a little happiness.

525
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,363
And for some reason,
even you don't know..

526
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,773
...that you were
happy with Amar, right.

527
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,274
But Amar isn't here anymore.

528
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:43,367
So what now?

529
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,578
Maybe not Amar, but you can
surely search for happiness.

530
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:52,819
You just..need to look ahead.

531
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,685
Happiness is right in front of you.

532
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,723
Go get your share of happiness
through your options.

533
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,456
What options?

534
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,522
I don't know.

535
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,921
Only you can see your options.

536
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,696
Maybe that lamp-post.

537
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,668
What about that lamp-post?

538
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:16,243
Maybe you'll find happiness
by just leaning on it.

539
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,648
Or maybe that..musician's music.

540
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,681
Or a cup of coffee
or a glass of champagne.

541
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,716
I don't know.

542
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,752
Taran..

543
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:31,817
...every minute.. a moment is
passing-by right now too..

544
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,824
All you need to do is..make
every passing moment happy.

545
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,301
And you decide what makes you happy.

546
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,339
That lamp-post, or that music or..

547
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,963
...coffee,
or the champagne or something else.

548
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,877
It's your life, your moments,
your happiness.

549
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,939
And so are the choices.

550
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,682
The wise Kabir says,
don't cage your heart, let it soar.

551
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,349
Roll the dice of joy,
enjoy the game.

552
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,618
...make your move,
0 free-spirited one!

553
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,985
O free-spirited one!

554
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:46,490
The wise Kabir says,
don't cage your heart, let it soar.

555
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,901
Roll the dice of joy,
enjoy the game.

556
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,404
...make your move,
0 free-spirited one!

557
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,600
O free-spirited one!

558
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,776
Once or many times,
you win some, you lose some.

559
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,679
Play your best, enjoy the game.

560
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,946
...make your move,
0 free-spirited one!

561
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,018
O free-spirited one!

562
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,825
The wise Kabir says,
don't cage your heart, let it soar.

563
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,454
Roll the dice of joy,
enjoy the game.

564
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,022
...make your move,
0 free-spirited one!

565
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,632
O free-spirited one!

566
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:48,024
I fly away to an unknown city.

567
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,362
What provokes this madness in me?

568
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,765
O free-spirited one!

569
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:58,030
Is this day or night?

570
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,509
Who cares to remember anymore!

571
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,845
What could be the magic?

572
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,677
O free-spirited one!

573
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,849
Once or many times,
you win some, you lose some.

574
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,684
Play your best, enjoy the game.

575
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,351
...make your move,
0 free-spirited one!

576
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,659
O free-spirited one!

577
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:25,658
The wise Kabir says,
don't cage your heart, let it soar.

578
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,496
Roll the dice of joy,
enjoy the game.

579
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:31,664
...make your move,
0 free-spirited one!

580
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,103
O free-spirited one!

581
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,644
You were right!

582
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,580
You were right!

583
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,449
Life should be like
this road, straight-ahead!

584
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:55,689
Life should rush into your lungs,
like this weather.

585
00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:00,468
Life should get entangled
in your curls, like this wind!

586
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,732
Are you okay?

587
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:39,564
Shekhar didn't know and..

588
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,973
...she gulped it down
like a professional.

589
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,841
She is asleep anyway.

590
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:48,106
You can overact when she wakes up.

591
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,672
Don't worry Manpreet, she is fine.

592
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,669
She was quite happy,
and this happened.

593
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,773
It's a good thing that she was happy.

594
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,110
Thanks.

595
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,520
See you.

596
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,598
Hey, Gurpreet.

597
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,570
I need to meet you, urgently.

598
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,912
Okay. is everything okay?

599
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,219
No-No-No!

600
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,217
This is a very serious matter.

601
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,629
After all he is Gurpreet's boyfriend.

602
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,199
He's invited us to dinner.

603
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,101
And Manpreet's refusing to go.

604
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,036
Now that will be very
embarrassing for her.

605
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,240
She hasn't even met him yet.

606
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:22,140
You mean she rejected
him without even meeting?

607
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,744
Exactly.

608
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,238
Just because he's a Pakistani.

609
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,542
- So what if he's a Pakistani.
Exactly.

610
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,215
They should meet once.

611
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,280
I can understand if
she rejects him later.

612
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,620
But she will never meet him!

613
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,226
You know how.. how stubborn she is!

614
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:44,027
Look, dear. I can talk
to her and she might even go.

615
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:47,598
But I can't guarantee you
what she will do when she gets there.

616
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,269
Let's take it one by one.

617
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,797
First we must get her to go there.

618
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,002
Well.. let's call her.

619
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:00,773
Why aren't you answering the phone?

620
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:02,248
Taran!

621
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,309
Must be papa..calling for you.

622
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:06,983
He always calls on the landline,
for you.

623
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,652
Yes, dear. How are you?

624
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:13,820
Hello, papa.

625
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,290
I am not fine.

626
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,062
You already know about Taran.

627
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,631
And that Gurpreet's
acting like a real 'twisty'.

628
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,825
Yeah dear, she did call.

629
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,128
Poor girl was crying a lot.

630
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,770
But we can't exactly
tie her to a pole.

631
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,067
How is it 'tying her to a pole'?

632
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,370
What are you saying?
The boy's a Pakistani.

633
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,146
You know the situation.

634
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,348
What situation, dear?

635
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,148
The kind that Pakistanis have.

636
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,186
Blasts here.. explosions there!

637
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:45,016
Dear, we'll consider
all that when we talk to them.

638
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,959
But I feel we should meet them once.

639
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,354
I talked to Shekhar as well.

640
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,225
He has the same opinion.

641
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,627
Anyone will have the same opinion.

642
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,362
You're too naive,
you don't know anything.

643
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,399
There's no point in going
to any Pakistani's home.

644
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:00,334
Out of the question.

645
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:05,338
Talk to him, dear.
And I'll do as you two say.

646
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,642
No.
And..

647
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,678
Talk to her.

648
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,007
She should feel that
someone's on her side.

649
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,020
If we try to corner her,
she will never agree.

650
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,179
Talk to her.

651
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:23,760
Yes, Manpreet.

652
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,733
What do you say, Shekhar?

653
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,798
Well..a Pakistani guy
is out of the question.

654
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:29,427
What?

655
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:30,837
Isn't it?

656
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,070
Yes.

657
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,767
And anyway,
there are no boys in Pakistan.

658
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:35,433
What?

659
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,745
Why? Are there no boys in Pakistan?

660
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,881
Well, half of them
are busy playing cricket.

661
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,877
...and the rest are unpredictable.

662
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,341
But there must be some guys.

663
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,853
Yeah..there must be a couple of them.

664
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,390
We'll come along to
see the guy if you say so..

665
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,262
...but our lives could
be at stake in Pakistan.

666
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,830
No Shekhar,
he lives right here..in Edinburgh.

667
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:01,891
I see.. so he moved here!

668
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,432
I am telling you very
clever these people are.

669
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,104
No he didn't move here,
he was born here.

670
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:11,802
But Manpreet, we must check whether
he's got a local passport or of Pakistan.

671
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,274
What difference does that make?

672
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,280
Even we have a local passport.
Unbelievable.

673
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,286
Well, that's true.

674
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,780
Passport doesn't matter.

675
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:26,018
He should be a nice
guy..and keep our girl happy.

676
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,493
But..what do we do about Pakistan?

677
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:36,170
I don't know..Gurpreet
likes him a lot.

678
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,803
But my heart doesn't agree at all.
Honestly.

679
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,233
Can I give you an advice?

680
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:42,939
Meet him.

681
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,473
And What if I like him?

682
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,178
Then don't tell Gurpreet
that you like him.

683
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,818
That's the problem Shekhar,
that's just it.

684
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:54,018
How will I say no if I like him?

685
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,384
He even has a local passport.

686
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:59,922
No Manpreet,
I don't trust these Pakistanis.

687
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,889
Who cares about their passport?

688
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,861
I see.

689
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,523
Well..we can at least go meet them.

690
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,195
At least we'll get some good food.

691
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,903
Pakistanis make really good food.

692
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:12,264
Yes..l think that sounds logical.

693
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,339
Let's go meet them,
we'll get to eat some good food too.

694
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:18,104
It's been so long I
haven't seen a Pakistani.

695
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:19,870
They are very handsome.

696
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,846
But remember Manpreet.

697
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,281
...we've to say no.

698
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,014
Of course we do.

699
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,952
But there's no harm in seeing one.

700
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,461
Come, dear.

701
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,562
The house looks okay.

702
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,270
How are you?
Fine.

703
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,439
Hello.
Hello. Please..come in.

704
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:50,877
Come, dear.

705
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,536
Your house is really beautiful,
Inshallah.

706
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,338
That's Mashallah.

707
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:55,572
Mashallah?

708
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,874
Isn't lnshallah and
Mashallah the same?

709
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:58,917
Not at all.

710
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,218
Inshallah is when you
want to say 'God Willing'.

711
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:05,322
Like 'You will like my
house 'lnshallah' (God Willing).

712
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,825
And Mashallah when you want
to say 'save you from evil eye'.

713
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,257
Like 'You're looking so beautiful
'Mashallah'.

714
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,326
Please come in.
I'll call my mother..

715
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,496
Your mother's still alive?

716
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,239
Of course..may God bless
her with a long life.

717
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,276
Mashallah! Mashallah!

718
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,410
My house looks lively again.

719
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,247
Otherwise he's always
busy-busy and more busy.

720
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,512
After meeting Gurpreet
I had some hope.

721
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,883
Your sister is really amazing.
That she is.

722
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,320
- Come, I'll show you around the house.
you Take a seat, mom.

723
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,551
I'll show them around.

724
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,520
Do you know the way around the house?

725
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:44,058
- You're mostly at the hospital.
Hospital? Why?

726
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,194
I am a doctor, Manpreet.

727
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,069
- Come, we'll show you around.
Yes.

728
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,896
This is our drawing room.
I see.

729
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,335
That's the kitchen.

730
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:53,905
We'll show you upstairs later.

731
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,442
This is the guest room.
And this is..

732
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,540
...our temple.

733
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,312
Temple?
Yes.

734
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,179
But Gurpreet said you're Pakistani.

735
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,616
We are Pakistanis.

736
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:09,351
Do you have any objection?

737
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,023
Of course not.

738
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,327
We don't if you don't.

739
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,652
But doesn't your
family have a problem.

740
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,090
Being a Pakistani,
you pray like Indians.

741
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:21,664
Manpreet dear, we're all Hindus.

742
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:24,101
But you're Pakistani.

743
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,036
There are Hindus even in Pakistan.

744
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,399
Just like there are Muslims in India.

745
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,604
Please come..
Thank you.

746
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,080
Gurpreet,
couldn't you tell me this before?

747
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,478
You never let me say
anything beyond Pakistan.

748
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,051
I get it, there's a little confusion.

749
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,280
Why do you wear a sherwani,
and not pant and shirt?

750
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,081
I always wear a pant and shin.

751
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,629
But I thought of wearing
this today so I could impress you.

752
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,220
Too much confusion!

753
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,626
There's a different between
religion and culture.

754
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:57,666
We're Hindu by religion..and
our culture is Pakistani.

755
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,035
And we're proud of our culture.

756
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,264
See..

757
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:04,604
Such a simple theory,
made so complicated by the world!

758
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,570
Things are always simple..

759
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,411
...but when you don't understand,
it gets complicated.

760
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,282
Yes.
Leave it.

761
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,408
I'll serve dinner.

762
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,351
I hope no one's vegetarian.

763
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,056
Wait a minute.

764
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,728
There's another surprise
in store after dinner.

765
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,258
Harry sings really well.
I see.

766
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,492
And so does mom.

767
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,099
So how about you sing
a song today for me.

768
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:49,048
The moon's very proud..

769
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:53,254
...about its moonlight.

770
01:00:53,683 --> 01:01:01,602
He hasn't met you yet,
hence the arrogance.

771
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:05,632
Is there a secret in your heart.

772
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:09,608
...or are you high on love?

773
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:18,117
There's definitely
a reason for such praises.

774
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:24,654
The crazy heart.

775
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:32,756
The crazy heart.

776
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:48,073
My beloved's come home today.

777
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:55,582
My heart's really elated.

778
01:01:56,446 --> 01:02:05,093
As I caught a glimpse of
my handsome beloved.

779
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:11,702
My eyes feel bewitched.

780
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:20,238
My eyes feel bewitched.

781
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,190
I am sorry we didn't
get a chance to talk.

782
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,837
I just wanted to say I am
so sorry I got so drunk that day.

783
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,743
You were happy, weren't you?

784
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,315
A lot.

785
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,713
Nice people.

786
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,147
Yes. Very nice.

787
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,226
They will keep Gurpreet happy.

788
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:18,895
Can I say something?
No.

789
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:20,405
Shut up.

790
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,339
You know, Shekhar's plans
for 2019 will soon get cancelled.

791
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,203
He's always looking
at Taran so secretly.

792
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,442
- He thinks we don't know.
- That's true.

793
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,678
But she's no less either.

794
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,651
She was whispering
to him on the terrace.

795
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:35,746
I wasn't whispering, only apologizing.

796
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,858
Oh my..apology.

797
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,791
You never apologized to us.

798
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:57,935
Go back to sleep,
it's not morning yet.

799
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:01,205
Someone's calling.

800
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,779
What are you doing?

801
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,419
Hello.

802
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:52,261
Hi.

803
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,328
Hi.

804
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,668
Let me guess..Francois called.
Yes.

805
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:59,932
The bank's sent a mail,
he's leaving from London.

806
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:01,570
He wanted to Stan work today itself.

807
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,768
Alright, sounds good.
I thought We could have coffee together.

808
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,708
I wanted to tell you first.

809
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,908
Nice house.

810
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,986
It's a mess, I like it like that.

811
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:25,959
Thanks.

812
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:27,799
For what?

813
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,403
A lot.

814
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:32,302
Not at all.

815
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,900
Francois is a dear friend.

816
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,807
We wouldn't have to go at all.

817
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,681
I could've called him
instead and he would've come.

818
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,678
But I thought you'll
get out of the house..

819
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,680
...see few things, think over things.

820
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:48,377
Yes, thanks for that.

821
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:49,581
Not for Francois.

822
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,491
I mean for that too..

823
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:56,958
But mostly..for all the
concern you've shown for me.

824
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:58,387
You've done so much.

825
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,765
You told me so many
things..about happiness.

826
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,369
About finding happiness.

827
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,538
Thanks.

828
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:14,472
See you.. I must go get ready.

829
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:29,988
I would really like it..if
you stay around me for this project.

830
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,397
Be with me.

831
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,995
See you, bye.

832
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,377
Taran!

833
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,047
Wait a minute.

834
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,516
When Zhi and I started our company..

835
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,523
...l used to wear this watch.

836
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,434
This watch changed my time.

837
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,062
I want you to have it.

838
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,132
Why are you doing all this for me?

839
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:17,604
I don't know.

840
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:21,879
I don't..

841
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:42,424
Blessed love...!

842
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:47,401
Blessed love...!

843
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:53,508
Blessed love...!

844
01:07:54,136 --> 01:08:03,989
I'm drenched by your shower of love.

845
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:13,595
Your breath makes me soar high.

846
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:19,190
The world shifted beneath my feet.

847
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:33,180
This never happened before.

848
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:44,154
Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!

849
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:54,534
Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!

850
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:22,159
Blessed love...!

851
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:27,196
Blessed love...!

852
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:32,269
Blessed love...!

853
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:37,848
Blessed love...!

854
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,887
Why does it feel like..

855
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:49,189
...your gaze lingers in my eyes!

856
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:59,194
Expressing things
that I never knew of.

857
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:03,971
You are everywhere I see..

858
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:09,310
...then how can I go away from you?

859
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:18,251
Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!

860
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:28,793
Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!

861
01:10:53,682 --> 01:11:03,296
I still stand where I met you first.

862
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:13,175
Your heart is the city,
from which I never returned.

863
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:23,020
I'm lost somewhere, do let
me know if you happen to find me.

864
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:32,257
Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!

865
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:42,366
Congratulations,
dear heart, this is love!

866
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:50,081
Blessed love...!

867
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:55,346
Blessed love...!

868
01:11:55,377 --> 01:12:00,258
Blessed love...!

869
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:04,387
Blessed love...!

870
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:10,727
Blessed love...!

871
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,438
What happened?

872
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:26,844
Nothing.

873
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:28,982
Taran, somethings wrong.

874
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,218
It's not like I don't miss him.

875
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,331
You know, some nights.

876
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:43,130
...l feel like I am plunging
thousands of feet below.

877
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,406
And I wake up suddenly.

878
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,446
What's wrong, Shekhar?

879
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:09,127
Shekhar?

880
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,361
What's wrong, Shekhar?

881
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:30,078
Whenever you're scared
of anything in life..

882
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,442
...then you must face it.

883
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,446
Fear is a coward.

884
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:40,821
If you stare directly in its eye,
it runs away.

885
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,668
You know, people have woken
up from coma even after 10 years.

886
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:13,278
Sometimes they lose their
memory..or something else.

887
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:16,041
Amar will be fine, so papa was saying.

888
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:19,510
And that French doctor
doesn't speak English.

889
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,315
But she was saying that he's fine.

890
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,213
But didn't papa talk to Amar as well?

891
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,419
Yes, they spoke briefly.
Yes.

892
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,186
Did papa leave from home?

893
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,394
He sounded okay on the phone.

894
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,160
He was saying he often
forgets few things.

895
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:38,227
But it all comes
back if you remind him.

896
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:41,931
I hope he's fine.

897
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,938
He will be absolutely fine, papa.

898
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,979
You know, sometimes
when you wake up from a nap..

899
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:49,442
...you often forget things.

900
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,610
And poor guy was in coma for 8 months.

901
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,450
But don't worry.
He'll be fine.

902
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:58,715
God bless that doctor.

903
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:03,122
She was saying.. someone
found him in a small river.

904
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,128
They kept treating him for 8 months.

905
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,363
How are you, Papa?

906
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,077
Where is Taran?

907
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,096
Amar.

908
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,677
This is the fourth time
we crossed this statue.

909
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,582
Being a drifter has its own perks.

910
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,552
Being a drifter has
its own benefits too.

911
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,159
If you pass-by the same road..

912
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,597
...you often notice new things.

913
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:36,441
Doctor, do you drink?
of course.

914
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:38,770
The martyrdom of the grapes
should never be in vain.

915
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,174
This is important.

916
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:43,381
Mix some love with alcohol.

917
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,482
No-No-no..
Why?

918
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:51,479
Go on, And Take him too.
Dance..

919
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,216
Papa..take papa along.

920
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:56,189
Go-Go-go.
What will I do?

921
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,749
There-there-there.

922
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:49,240
Guys.. I am absolutely fine.

923
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:50,641
And papa..
Yes.

924
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,342
Don't worry at all.

925
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,611
From tomorrow I will resume office,
I promise.

926
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:56,546
No need to go to the office.

927
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:58,521
Do you know the state we were in?

928
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,392
Please sit next to me for a while.

929
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,897
I'll obey all your orders.

930
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,697
Do exactly as you say.

931
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:10,528
And I promise, I will get well soon.
Absolutely fit, like before.

932
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,844
Cheers to Amar's return!

933
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:21,336
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

934
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:22,447
Cheers!

935
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:47,031
Come.

936
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:53,340
You're really late today.

937
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,578
It's time you hit the bed.

938
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,650
Manpreet and everybody
are waiting downstairs.

939
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:05,983
Amar.

940
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:07,958
Amar.

941
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,928
You need to sleep.

942
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,634
But you look so beautiful.

943
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:09,679
Get changed, get into bed and call me.

944
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,957
Manpreet and everyone are waiting.

945
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:19,387
What?

946
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,728
Fine.

947
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:43,919
Hi.

948
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,086
You didn't show up?

949
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:50,195
You know what,
just as you guys left..

950
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:51,961
...I ran into an old friend.

951
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:56,627
He said let's have some
coffee and ordered beer.

952
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:58,197
Then we just went on.

953
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:01,834
I am so happy for you.

954
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:05,067
For everyone actually.

955
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,605
Are you driving?

956
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:11,011
Yes. Why?

957
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,852
Nothing. just go home.

958
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:16,778
Of course.

959
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:20,719
You take care. I'll see you soon.

960
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:24,056
Bye.
Bye.

961
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,997
Go GN:OM on.
Okay?

962
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,757
Yeah..alright.
Yes-Yes-yes..

963
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,929
- Good morning, Shekhar!
Hi, Good Morning.

964
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:06,534
Good morning.

965
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:10,034
It's okay, I've got it..

966
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:11,837
You guys are so early today.

967
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,637
- Could've shown up a little later.
Yeah.

968
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:16,873
Actually, we went out for breakfast.
Pete's.

969
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,679
We go there every
Saturday for breakfast.

970
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:22,253
It's about an hour
and a half from here.

971
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:24,648
They sell the best pancakes
in the world.

972
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:25,156
Sure.

973
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,951
Amar really wanted to go
there..so we left as early as 7am.

974
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:33,790
Daniel, Francoise..pancakes.
Coming.

975
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:34,889
Come fast.

976
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,063
You know Jasleen..
Who?

977
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:41,869
The girl beating the drums
at the airport.

978
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,004
Oh yes, right.

979
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:44,202
She is throwing a party today.

980
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:47,044
She has invited you as
well as Francoise and Daniel.

981
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:49,943
Listen guys, you guys have to come.
All of you.

982
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:51,306
Okay.

983
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,751
Sounds nice, but I hardly know her.

984
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:58,255
- You know..doesn't make sense.
What? No, please.

985
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,150
Come on, it will be so much fun.

986
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:03,126
Please-Please-please.
Okay.

987
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:04,287
Thanks.

988
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:06,121
Well, we've to get ready,
so we're leaving.

989
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:08,597
Guys, see you at 12..sharp.

990
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,135
Bye- Bye.
Bye. .

991
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:20,312
You won't come, will you?

992
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,114
No.

993
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:49,038
I knew you wouldn't come.

994
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:52,077
That's why I didn't
go with the others.

995
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,338
Why are you complicating life, papa?

996
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,649
Complication is life's problem, son.

997
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,912
Life will decide its course.

998
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:06,991
But we must give life one
fair chance atleast.. isn't it?

999
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:13,028
Hello?

1000
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:14,191
Hello!

1001
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:15,757
Yes?

1002
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,063
Hello, yes?

1003
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:18,202
Greetings!

1004
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:28,811
Greetings! How are you?

1005
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:31,713
I'm dumbstruck by your looks.

1006
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:35,817
I've done the unspeakable.

1007
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:41,254
You're dumbstruck by my looks,
you've done the unspeakable.

1008
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,692
Seeing you groove..

1009
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:47,995
Seeing you groove,
I want to get on the floor.

1010
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:49,428
Yes?

1011
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:53,796
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1012
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:57,966
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1013
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:02,037
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1014
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:06,175
I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!

1015
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:10,381
I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!

1016
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:14,854
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1017
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:27,237
He looks into my eyes when flirting.
Doesn't let any chance pass.

1018
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:32,768
My heart skips a beat
when it hears your golden voice.

1019
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,816
Touches me here and there..
enjoy the feel of it!

1020
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:44,050
When I tell him to stop stalking me,
he doesn't relent.

1021
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:48,116
I have come only for you,
only for you have I come!

1022
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:50,822
I'll walk into these clubs for you.

1023
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:52,228
Yes.. yes.. yes!

1024
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:56,392
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1025
01:29:56,491 --> 01:30:00,735
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1026
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:04,868
I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!

1027
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:09,005
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1028
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,016
I wanna dance with you..

1029
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:19,423
Greetings! How are you?

1030
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:21,494
I'm dumbstruck by your looks.

1031
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:23,792
I've done the unspeakable.

1032
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:27,890
You're dumbstruck by my looks,
you've done the unspeakable.

1033
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:30,128
Seeing you groove..

1034
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:34,536
Seeing you groove,
I want to get on the floor.

1035
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:36,000
Yes?

1036
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:40,304
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1037
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:44,440
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1038
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:48,544
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1039
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:52,815
I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!

1040
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:57,021
I wanna dance with you..
alas, you can't dance!

1041
01:30:57,151 --> 01:31:01,361
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1042
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:18,212
I wanna dance with you..
alas, I can't dance!

1043
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:12,499
Gurpreet was saying
you're going somewhere.

1044
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:16,071
Yes.

1045
01:32:17,098 --> 01:32:20,944
I was thinking..
to my father's hometown, India.

1046
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,624
This watch doesn't suit me anymore.

1047
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:47,366
It's showing me some
very strange times.

1048
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:21,506
What did Shekhar say?

1049
01:33:23,064 --> 01:33:25,544
Nothing, that he's happy for me.

1050
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:28,240
Is he leaving?

1051
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:34,351
Yes..he was saying,
that after the opening..

1052
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:42,953
Don't think anything.

1053
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:45,129
...just leave it for a while.

1054
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:24,034
Hi..
What are you wearing?

1055
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:27,569
How is this?
Black is such a night color.

1056
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:28,537
This one.

1057
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:34,103
Hey, this one we got
from Switzerland. Remember?

1058
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:37,605
This one fits nicely..and..green..

1059
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:41,015
This white shin will go with green,
and it also suits you really well.

1060
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:43,348
I think brown-green-And white.
Perfect.

1061
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:50,690
What would I have done without you?

1062
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:53,531
Thank God I have you in my life.

1063
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,132
What's wrong?

1064
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:07,371
Tired?

1065
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:09,247
No, it's nothing.

1066
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:12,717
You get ready quickly, I've to run.

1067
01:35:57,490 --> 01:36:01,199
Two people..without whom
I didn't know where to begin.

1068
01:36:01,427 --> 01:36:02,462
Francois and Daniel.

1069
01:36:02,595 --> 01:36:03,767
Can I have you guys here please?

1070
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:11,571
And one..

1071
01:36:14,507 --> 01:36:15,315
...friend..

1072
01:36:16,242 --> 01:36:18,483
Without whom this would've
never been possible.

1073
01:36:19,112 --> 01:36:19,817
Shekhar.

1074
01:36:20,713 --> 01:36:22,215
Can I have you here please?

1075
01:36:30,656 --> 01:36:32,567
I don't want to thank him.

1076
01:36:32,825 --> 01:36:35,396
I just want him to stand next to me.

1077
01:36:42,602 --> 01:36:46,607
The more you share,
the happier you feel.

1078
01:36:47,373 --> 01:36:49,410
So I just want to
say thank you guys..

1079
01:36:49,575 --> 01:36:52,556
...for coming here,
to be a pan of my happiness.

1080
01:36:52,678 --> 01:36:54,749
Thank you. Thank you.

1081
01:36:55,181 --> 01:36:55,818
Thank you.

1082
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:04,700
Thank you.

1083
01:37:06,826 --> 01:37:11,826
Whom should I anger.. who
should I be upset with?

1084
01:37:17,703 --> 01:37:22,880
Both are my reflections.

1085
01:37:23,209 --> 01:37:28,625
...who should I break away from?

1086
01:37:28,948 --> 01:37:33,948
As if, your eyes ask me something.

1087
01:37:55,675 --> 01:37:57,677
Shekhar, I want you to meet Amar.

1088
01:37:57,944 --> 01:38:00,584
Hi, Amar.
Hi, Shekhar.

1089
01:38:00,746 --> 01:38:02,623
Thank you so much for everything.

1090
01:38:03,516 --> 01:38:04,893
Taran can't stop talking about you.

1091
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:07,757
It's great to meet you.

1092
01:38:08,888 --> 01:38:10,231
I am so happy for you.

1093
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:15,538
Okay, I need to take Amar home,
with papa.

1094
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:17,641
Because he needs
to turn into bed early.

1095
01:38:20,366 --> 01:38:21,640
Shall we?
Yeah.

1096
01:38:22,235 --> 01:38:24,647
And I'll call you, there's
something we need to talk about.

1097
01:38:24,704 --> 01:38:25,444
Sure.

1098
01:38:25,705 --> 01:38:26,649
Bye.

1099
01:38:27,673 --> 01:38:28,515
See you.

1100
01:38:43,422 --> 01:38:44,025
You okay?

1101
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:49,039
Yeah!

1102
01:38:54,467 --> 01:38:55,468
Are you sure?

1103
01:38:57,537 --> 01:38:58,447
Yeah, I am sure.

1104
01:39:22,728 --> 01:39:23,832
Goodnight, Amar.

1105
01:39:26,933 --> 01:39:28,776
Be ready on time tomorrow.

1106
01:39:29,535 --> 01:39:30,741
We've to visit the temple.

1107
01:39:33,973 --> 01:39:35,077
I'll come, pick you up.

1108
01:39:44,817 --> 01:39:45,818
Taran..

1109
01:39:51,724 --> 01:39:52,759
Congratulations.

1110
01:39:56,729 --> 01:39:57,730
Goodnight.

1111
01:40:16,115 --> 01:40:16,957
Come here.

1112
01:40:26,492 --> 01:40:28,529
Always concerned
about others happiness.

1113
01:40:29,829 --> 01:40:30,899
Are you happy?

1114
01:40:34,834 --> 01:40:35,778
No, papa.

1115
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:39,572
I am very sad.

1116
01:40:41,507 --> 01:40:42,383
A lot.

1117
01:40:45,411 --> 01:40:48,085
A lot, papa.
No, dear.

1118
01:40:49,048 --> 01:40:50,152
Be happy.

1119
01:40:51,384 --> 01:40:53,386
You must find your happiness first.

1120
01:40:53,786 --> 01:40:55,823
Otherwise how will
you spread happiness?

1121
01:40:58,524 --> 01:41:02,802
Even if it means making someone sad.

1122
01:41:03,796 --> 01:41:05,798
Do what is right.

1123
01:41:07,867 --> 01:41:09,608
Do what you feel is right!

1124
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:13,880
There's nothing more you can do.

1125
01:41:15,608 --> 01:41:16,518
Right?

1126
01:41:36,095 --> 01:41:39,508
You said 'meet me for breakfast at 9'.

1127
01:41:41,701 --> 01:41:43,203
I was there at 9.

1128
01:41:45,738 --> 01:41:46,876
But you didn't show up.

1129
01:41:48,741 --> 01:41:53,747
I looked around, asked
people if anyone had seen you.

1130
01:41:55,214 --> 01:41:57,057
But no one had seen you.

1131
01:41:58,117 --> 01:42:01,530
By the time it was
12, I was getting scared.

1132
01:42:02,655 --> 01:42:04,726
I asked papa to come down.

1133
01:42:07,993 --> 01:42:09,666
You didn't show up all night.

1134
01:42:11,097 --> 01:42:12,633
Nor the next day.

1135
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:16,738
The people who were
helping us look for you..

1136
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:23,920
It was clearly evident from
their faces, that we've lost you.

1137
01:42:29,248 --> 01:42:30,249
Amar..

1138
01:42:31,016 --> 01:42:35,761
...I never even dreamt
about a life without you.

1139
01:42:37,156 --> 01:42:40,729
I didn't know what to do.

1140
01:42:43,662 --> 01:42:45,972
Then I mustered a lot
of courage and stood up again.

1141
01:42:46,732 --> 01:42:49,941
Thinking that I had
to continue without you.

1142
01:42:51,137 --> 01:42:54,812
But then suddenly, I
bumped into this fool.

1143
01:42:56,642 --> 01:42:57,780
Shekhar.

1144
01:43:03,215 --> 01:43:05,695
As soon as I took my eyes off you..

1145
01:43:07,253 --> 01:43:10,700
...life swept me off my feet.

1146
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:30,018
Today, I want to confess to you
in His presence, Amar.

1147
01:43:30,943 --> 01:43:33,549
No matter how much I love you..

1148
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:42,293
But now there's someone
else in my life.

1149
01:43:58,103 --> 01:44:00,105
I am always late, right?

1150
01:44:12,885 --> 01:44:13,761
Shekhar.

1151
01:44:14,286 --> 01:44:15,287
- Hi!
- Hi!

1152
01:44:18,057 --> 01:44:20,628
Buddy, I can never lie.

1153
01:44:21,193 --> 01:44:22,365
She knows.

1154
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:29,740
It's not my fault..nor is it yours.

1155
01:44:30,603 --> 01:44:34,107
The only difference
is that I was her past.

1156
01:44:35,074 --> 01:44:36,712
...and you're her present.

1157
01:44:39,378 --> 01:44:44,293
You know, when I woke
up, I didn't know who I was.

1158
01:44:45,317 --> 01:44:47,388
I couldn't use my hands or limbs.

1159
01:44:48,621 --> 01:44:50,692
For two days they
taught me how to walk.

1160
01:44:50,923 --> 01:44:53,927
Later I remembered papa..then Taran.

1161
01:44:54,226 --> 01:44:56,103
I vaguely remembered my accident.

1162
01:44:58,030 --> 01:44:59,236
Then God.

1163
01:45:00,065 --> 01:45:01,339
Anything could've happened.

1164
01:45:03,102 --> 01:45:04,172
But no..

1165
01:45:05,237 --> 01:45:06,648
I came back.

1166
01:45:07,373 --> 01:45:09,148
Papa's absolutely fine, he's happy.

1167
01:45:09,742 --> 01:45:12,018
Gurpreet, Taran..they are all fine.

1168
01:45:12,077 --> 01:45:13,249
They are all very happy.

1169
01:45:13,812 --> 01:45:17,817
But if there's anything
I've lost in this entire incident.

1170
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,031
...then that's my right on Taran.

1171
01:45:25,891 --> 01:45:26,801
What.

1172
01:45:27,893 --> 01:45:29,770
...more can I give you?

1173
01:45:38,404 --> 01:45:40,247
Take good care of her, Shekhar.

1174
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:45,082
At least she will still be my friend.

1175
01:45:47,179 --> 01:45:49,125
Maybe you can call
me someday to scold me.

1176
01:45:52,985 --> 01:45:53,986
See you.

1177
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:17,452
Taran, he's your friend.

1178
01:46:18,911 --> 01:46:20,117
You love him.

1179
01:46:22,114 --> 01:46:23,957
You've seen many dreams with him.

1180
01:46:24,316 --> 01:46:25,954
Waited for him.

1181
01:46:30,923 --> 01:46:31,993
Who am I?

1182
01:46:33,058 --> 01:46:35,402
Where did I come from?
How long have you known me?

1183
01:46:38,163 --> 01:46:39,801
Let me go to hell.

1184
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,207
I will fly away again.

1185
01:46:43,736 --> 01:46:45,215
Why are you doing this, Taran?

1186
01:46:46,438 --> 01:46:47,143
Why?

1187
01:46:47,206 --> 01:46:50,244
Don't you always say,
'do the right thing'.

1188
01:46:52,111 --> 01:46:53,249
It wasn't your fault.

1189
01:46:54,113 --> 01:46:56,218
You just came in our
lives without a reason.

1190
01:46:57,116 --> 01:46:58,993
You didn't do anything wrong, Shekhar.

1191
01:46:59,752 --> 01:47:03,393
You supported papa. You
did so much for me.

1192
01:47:04,456 --> 01:47:05,867
What do I do?

1193
01:47:06,425 --> 01:47:09,497
Tell you to leave,
because Amar's back.

1194
01:47:09,795 --> 01:47:11,069
Your job's done.

1195
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:13,134
It's his fault.

1196
01:47:14,066 --> 01:47:15,443
It's completely his fault.

1197
01:47:15,934 --> 01:47:17,072
Where was he?

1198
01:47:17,803 --> 01:47:19,373
Where was he for 8 months?

1199
01:47:19,772 --> 01:47:20,773
Where was he?

1200
01:47:51,403 --> 01:47:58,343
The night was spent such that..

1201
01:47:58,510 --> 01:48:02,151
...I couldn't find dawn.

1202
01:48:02,915 --> 01:48:07,915
As if, the soul
left the body quietly.

1203
01:48:13,992 --> 01:48:18,992
As if, life moved on fast.
very fast.

1204
01:48:25,237 --> 01:48:30,237
As if, life moved on fast.
very fast.

1205
01:49:22,127 --> 01:49:25,597
How do I walk away..

1206
01:49:25,931 --> 01:49:32,314
...if he lives somewhere in me?

1207
01:49:33,438 --> 01:49:39,912
I try to walk past
without her noticing..

1208
01:49:40,179 --> 01:49:44,218
It feels as if..

1209
01:49:44,316 --> 01:49:54,101
...her gaze quietly follows me.

1210
01:51:11,603 --> 01:51:12,775
Hi, Shekhar.
Hi, Amar.

1211
01:51:13,071 --> 01:51:13,674
Please..

1212
01:51:17,409 --> 01:51:21,118
Shekhar, I am really sorry
that I came here to talk about this.

1213
01:51:21,713 --> 01:51:24,751
It was Taran's decision
that she wants to live with you.

1214
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:29,164
And she's my friend,
and I would always want her to be one.

1215
01:51:30,455 --> 01:51:31,456
Of course.

1216
01:51:32,424 --> 01:51:38,670
Shekhar, Navjot,
Manpreet, Gurpreet, papa..Taran..

1217
01:51:39,431 --> 01:51:41,104
...they all love you.

1218
01:51:42,534 --> 01:51:44,241
And there must be
a reason why they do.

1219
01:51:45,237 --> 01:51:49,379
I am relatively new, and I am sure
I'll Stan loving you just as much.

1220
01:51:53,045 --> 01:51:55,423
But give me some time.

1221
01:51:59,418 --> 01:52:01,489
But Shekhar, believe me..

1222
01:52:01,787 --> 01:52:06,566
...l'll never do anything
to hum you or Taran in anyway.

1223
01:52:06,758 --> 01:52:07,668
Never.

1224
01:52:10,662 --> 01:52:12,141
Yeah, I know that Amar.

1225
01:52:18,103 --> 01:52:22,609
I only came here because,
that day Taran told me what she wants.

1226
01:52:23,275 --> 01:52:25,277
I thought I should
tell you what I think.

1227
01:52:32,718 --> 01:52:33,822
'It wasn't your fault.'

1228
01:52:35,087 --> 01:52:36,430
'Don't you always say..

1229
01:52:37,622 --> 01:52:39,101
'Do the right thing'.

1230
01:52:40,225 --> 01:52:41,226
'Amar.'

1231
01:52:41,827 --> 01:52:43,170
'It wasn't your fault.'

1232
01:52:45,831 --> 01:52:47,139
'It wasn't your fault.'

1233
01:53:45,257 --> 01:53:49,569
Taran, please..careful.
Shekhar.. Shekhar..

1234
01:53:50,328 --> 01:53:51,204
I am okay.

1235
01:53:52,297 --> 01:53:53,776
Shekhar..
I am Okay.

1236
01:53:54,933 --> 01:53:57,641
Doctor.. I love you.

1237
01:53:59,404 --> 01:54:00,405
I am okay.

1238
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:03,950
So..goodnight.

1239
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:06,745
Goodnight.

1240
01:54:07,546 --> 01:54:09,548
- I'll see you.
- Shekhar!

1241
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:12,961
Nighty-night.

1242
01:54:22,594 --> 01:54:24,870
You don't know how
much I love you, Taran.

1243
01:55:21,521 --> 01:55:22,864
Hey, good morning.

1244
01:55:23,056 --> 01:55:24,694
Good afternoon, really.

1245
01:55:25,191 --> 01:55:27,899
I just woke up.
I know.

1246
01:55:27,961 --> 01:55:30,168
I knew you will call
as soon as you wake up.

1247
01:55:31,131 --> 01:55:32,508
You slept well?

1248
01:55:32,799 --> 01:55:33,937
Where are you? At home?

1249
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,577
Guess where?

1250
01:55:36,803 --> 01:55:37,907
Patisserie?

1251
01:55:38,905 --> 01:55:41,181
No, I am driving back from London.

1252
01:55:41,774 --> 01:55:43,151
London? Why?

1253
01:55:43,943 --> 01:55:45,752
You dropped me home at 5.

1254
01:55:45,912 --> 01:55:47,585
You know we all forgot.

1255
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:50,056
Amar had an appointment today,
with the doctor.

1256
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:52,661
I remembered just
after I dropped you home.

1257
01:55:52,752 --> 01:55:54,095
I went straight to Amar's house.

1258
01:55:54,154 --> 01:55:56,532
Papa was supposed to drive him there.

1259
01:55:56,789 --> 01:55:58,666
Thank God I made it in time.

1260
01:56:01,995 --> 01:56:03,065
Hello.

1261
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:04,704
Hello.

1262
01:56:04,831 --> 01:56:06,833
Sorry..bad network probably.

1263
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,770
Yeah, the mountains.

1264
01:56:08,868 --> 01:56:10,609
You know, there's amazing news.

1265
01:56:11,237 --> 01:56:14,275
Now Amar only has to go
see the doctor once in six months.

1266
01:56:14,874 --> 01:56:16,182
He's recovering so well.

1267
01:56:18,077 --> 01:56:20,079
Taran, the network is really bad.

1268
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:23,790
But congratulations,
I am happy for you.

1269
01:56:24,684 --> 01:56:25,788
And Amar.

1270
01:56:26,886 --> 01:56:30,095
Anyway, I'll speak to you
later..whenever you get the time.

1271
01:56:30,156 --> 01:56:32,158
Yeah, okay. Bye.

1272
01:56:32,759 --> 01:56:33,999
Yeah, bye.

1273
01:57:19,339 --> 01:57:20,647
Taran..

1274
01:57:23,276 --> 01:57:25,347
...let's not meet for few days.

1275
01:57:29,649 --> 01:57:31,720
It's not Shekhar's fault.

1276
01:57:32,285 --> 01:57:34,322
...but, anyone can feel bad.

1277
01:57:44,364 --> 01:57:45,638
See you..

1278
01:57:47,267 --> 01:57:49,770
I am so happy you're
recovering so quickly.

1279
01:57:50,903 --> 01:57:51,973
This isn't done.

1280
01:57:52,705 --> 01:57:55,345
If you're angry,
call up..talk..fight.

1281
01:57:55,842 --> 01:57:57,150
This is absurd.

1282
01:57:57,277 --> 01:57:59,154
His phone's switched
off..and he's missing.

1283
01:58:00,713 --> 01:58:05,025
She hasn't slept all night..and now,
we've to go look for him.

1284
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,724
I can't reach him.

1285
01:58:08,988 --> 01:58:10,695
Maybe his phone's not working.

1286
01:58:10,857 --> 01:58:13,064
It's not the phone,
but his mind that isn't working!

1287
01:58:13,192 --> 01:58:14,296
Even last night.

1288
01:58:14,694 --> 01:58:16,367
Let's talk about this later.

1289
01:58:16,963 --> 01:58:19,807
When? He's been missing for two days.

1290
01:58:19,932 --> 01:58:20,967
You know..

1291
01:58:21,067 --> 01:58:23,069
Let's not speak in front of her,
it'll upset her.

1292
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:07,919
Hi, Taran.

1293
01:59:09,115 --> 01:59:09,957
Hi.

1294
01:59:16,389 --> 01:59:18,426
Gurpreet..come on.
Sorry..

1295
01:59:18,925 --> 01:59:22,896
Sorry, my friend came over and..

1296
01:59:23,162 --> 01:59:24,971
...we went out to watch the game.

1297
01:59:25,832 --> 01:59:27,277
We had some beer.

1298
01:59:33,473 --> 01:59:34,781
Where is Amar?

1299
01:59:36,109 --> 01:59:37,110
Where's Amar?

1300
01:59:41,013 --> 01:59:42,890
Aahh..he sleeps early.

1301
01:59:43,883 --> 01:59:45,419
Did he take his meds?

1302
01:59:46,119 --> 01:59:48,030
Did he?

1303
01:59:50,223 --> 01:59:51,827
He must have.

1304
01:59:52,925 --> 01:59:57,169
Anyway, I think it's quite late,
we should get going.

1305
02:00:00,466 --> 02:00:03,208
I am okay.
I am fine.

1306
02:00:03,369 --> 02:00:05,872
- You're not fine.
I am Fine.

1307
02:00:06,005 --> 02:00:07,951
Not Fine.
- I said I am fine!

1308
02:00:08,508 --> 02:00:09,987
I am Fine.
Shekhar, enough.

1309
02:00:10,276 --> 02:00:11,755
Enough what, Taran?

1310
02:00:12,512 --> 02:00:13,513
Enough what?

1311
02:00:13,846 --> 02:00:15,519
I want to tell you enough.

1312
02:00:15,915 --> 02:00:17,895
Did I tell you to love me?

1313
02:00:18,117 --> 02:00:20,859
Did I tell you not to love Amar?

1314
02:00:21,287 --> 02:00:25,929
But..you told Amar, that you love me.

1315
02:00:26,526 --> 02:00:27,504
Yes.

1316
02:00:29,529 --> 02:00:30,200
I did.

1317
02:00:30,496 --> 02:00:31,338
Yeah..

1318
02:00:33,433 --> 02:00:35,242
Come on,
Shekhar..let's talk tomorrow.

1319
02:00:35,802 --> 02:00:37,042
I don't want to talk.

1320
02:00:38,204 --> 02:00:39,205
<i>L</i> am going.

1321
02:00:40,306 --> 02:00:41,546
Forever.

1322
02:00:42,842 --> 02:00:45,482
- Shekhar, let's..
- I said I don't want to talk.

1323
02:00:45,545 --> 02:00:48,549
Enough, son.
That's enough for today.

1324
02:00:49,549 --> 02:00:51,551
You want to go home, go home.

1325
02:00:52,819 --> 02:00:54,355
You can speak with Taran tomorrow.

1326
02:01:01,561 --> 02:01:02,471
Shekhar.

1327
02:01:05,498 --> 02:01:06,408
Brother..

1328
02:01:32,058 --> 02:01:33,469
He's not that kind of a guy.

1329
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:35,839
I can't believe this.

1330
02:01:37,196 --> 02:01:37,970
I know.

1331
02:02:16,869 --> 02:02:18,246
Who is Shekhar, Taran?

1332
02:02:24,911 --> 02:02:26,584
He's not the son of my friend.

1333
02:02:29,148 --> 02:02:30,126
I lied.

1334
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:39,467
He suddenly showed
up one day out of nowhere.

1335
02:02:46,966 --> 02:02:49,412
Both of us were in a place
where we shouldn't have been.

1336
02:02:59,045 --> 02:03:00,956
It wasn't his fault either, sir.

1337
02:03:02,248 --> 02:03:03,522
Nor was it mine.

1338
02:03:17,496 --> 02:03:21,103
I was right behind you two
when you were looking for him.

1339
02:03:23,603 --> 02:03:24,946
Waiting.

1340
02:03:26,472 --> 02:03:28,042
I was waiting too..

1341
02:03:29,508 --> 02:03:30,646
...for Amar to be found.

1342
02:03:32,378 --> 02:03:34,380
And get this big load off my chest.

1343
02:03:35,615 --> 02:03:37,993
Truth takes up a lot
of space in your heart, sir.

1344
02:03:39,952 --> 02:03:40,987
There's no way to accommodate it.

1345
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:49,264
I couldn't take it anymore.

1346
02:03:50,429 --> 02:03:53,410
I thought I should tell you the truth.

1347
02:03:55,501 --> 02:03:57,208
Unwillingly..

1348
02:03:58,571 --> 02:04:01,518
...l snatched the most valuable thing
from yours and Taran's life.

1349
02:04:04,276 --> 02:04:05,619
I have no one..

1350
02:04:06,512 --> 02:04:07,650
...so I'll do whatever you say.

1351
02:04:10,282 --> 02:04:11,625
Take me to the police.

1352
02:04:12,585 --> 02:04:14,087
Kill me.

1353
02:04:15,388 --> 02:04:16,492
Make me your slave.

1354
02:04:19,525 --> 02:04:21,095
Or make me your son!

1355
02:04:30,436 --> 02:04:32,712
He had no reason to come here.

1356
02:04:33,706 --> 02:04:35,208
To tell the truth.

1357
02:04:38,077 --> 02:04:40,318
But from what I saw in his eyes..

1358
02:04:42,348 --> 02:04:44,794
...I felt he can be trusted.

1359
02:04:58,664 --> 02:04:59,574
All of us were..

1360
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:05,542
...trying to deal with your accident,
in our own ways.

1361
02:05:10,042 --> 02:05:12,079
He wanted to deal with it too.

1362
02:05:14,547 --> 02:05:16,288
He wanted to help me.

1363
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:23,561
But in a way,
he was asking for my help too.

1364
02:05:26,092 --> 02:05:28,333
In the beginning,
I would take him to the office.

1365
02:05:30,362 --> 02:05:34,333
In the evenings,
he would drop by for some coffee.

1366
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:35,271
'Shekhar.'

1367
02:05:35,434 --> 02:05:36,435
-'Hi.
- Hi.'

1368
02:05:43,409 --> 02:05:47,414
I didn't realize..when he
became more like a son to me.

1369
02:06:14,473 --> 02:06:15,816
You can't find him now, son.

1370
02:06:46,705 --> 02:06:49,379
You're ok, you're fine.

1371
02:06:49,742 --> 02:06:51,449
Careful.

1372
02:07:27,246 --> 02:07:30,250
It's just this wound over
my left eye that hurts, otherwise..

1373
02:07:30,349 --> 02:07:31,953
Do you have any clue
how drunk you are?

1374
02:07:32,518 --> 02:07:34,191
And who drives after getting so high?

1375
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:35,797
Are you a doctor or a cop?

1376
02:07:36,222 --> 02:07:37,326
Just do your job.

1377
02:07:43,662 --> 02:07:44,936
What are you doing?

1378
02:07:46,332 --> 02:07:47,868
You're hurting that poor girl.

1379
02:07:48,734 --> 02:07:50,338
A little pain now..

1380
02:07:52,571 --> 02:07:54,448
...will save her from
a lifetime of anguish.

1381
02:07:55,841 --> 02:07:57,548
Let me go, please.

1382
02:07:59,478 --> 02:08:01,219
You don't love her?

1383
02:08:04,383 --> 02:08:06,454
Love is not some relationship.

1384
02:08:08,821 --> 02:08:12,462
It's a ray of light
which offers a glimpse of God.

1385
02:08:15,227 --> 02:08:17,605
And I am listening to my God now.

1386
02:09:08,314 --> 02:09:09,418
Hello, sir.
Hi.

1387
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:10,821
The aircraft is ready, sir.

1388
02:09:10,849 --> 02:09:12,954
Should be able to take
off in about 15 minutes.

1389
02:09:14,353 --> 02:09:15,798
I want to meet him.

1390
02:09:17,323 --> 02:09:19,735
I want him to tell
me what my fault was.

1391
02:09:20,326 --> 02:09:21,964
And then he can go
wherever he wants to.

1392
02:09:22,895 --> 02:09:25,034
Taran..
I want to meet him.

1393
02:09:25,597 --> 02:09:28,635
He can't do this. I want to meet him.

1394
02:09:28,968 --> 02:09:29,810
But.

1395
02:09:29,902 --> 02:09:31,973
He will take off in 15 minutes.

1396
02:09:34,406 --> 02:09:37,944
I don't know where he is going.

1397
02:09:40,612 --> 02:09:43,092
There's no chance of
getting there in 15 minutes.

1398
02:09:43,716 --> 02:09:45,024
Traffic.
Harry..

1399
02:09:45,384 --> 02:09:46,089
Can't make it.

1400
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:49,925
Taran's question is important.

1401
02:09:50,823 --> 02:09:52,894
I will get her there in 15 minutes.

1402
02:09:53,058 --> 02:09:55,038
But I need your help, please.

1403
02:11:13,005 --> 02:11:13,881
Shekhar.

1404
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:36,770
Don't do this to her.

1405
02:11:40,766 --> 02:11:42,575
First she grieved for me..

1406
02:11:43,869 --> 02:11:45,439
...now she will grieve for you.

1407
02:11:46,105 --> 02:11:49,552
Please..what is her fault?

1408
02:11:58,684 --> 02:11:59,754
I know..

1409
02:12:01,153 --> 02:12:02,928
...who you are.

1410
02:12:03,856 --> 02:12:05,028
We all do.

1411
02:12:07,893 --> 02:12:10,100
But we still love you.

1412
02:12:18,804 --> 02:12:20,545
That's the problem.

1413
02:12:22,674 --> 02:12:24,017
...everyone loves me.

1414
02:12:26,812 --> 02:12:28,257
Otherwise it was so easy.

1415
02:12:29,114 --> 02:12:33,585
I would've quietly escaped..

1416
02:12:33,919 --> 02:12:35,159
...to my world.

1417
02:12:44,563 --> 02:12:46,065
Why did you show up again?

1418
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:49,545
You made this all the
more difficult for me to leave.

1419
02:12:50,269 --> 02:12:51,748
Why do you want to go, Shekhar?

1420
02:12:52,638 --> 02:12:54,777
You had your own
world before I arrived.

1421
02:12:55,107 --> 02:12:57,087
And now you have that back.

1422
02:12:58,777 --> 02:13:00,779
And there's no place
for Shekhar in that world.

1423
02:13:01,547 --> 02:13:03,959
Will you decide whom I love?

1424
02:13:06,218 --> 02:13:11,531
Only I have that
right. me.. not you.

1425
02:13:12,958 --> 02:13:14,904
If I had that right.

1426
02:13:17,029 --> 02:13:19,202
...then you could've
never loved someone else.

1427
02:13:20,766 --> 02:13:24,077
Not now..or in the next
lifetime..or after that.

1428
02:13:25,571 --> 02:13:26,572
Then why?

1429
02:13:29,174 --> 02:13:30,949
I just want to tell you..

1430
02:13:31,143 --> 02:13:37,560
What you're doing is completely
different from what you want, Taran.

1431
02:13:37,983 --> 02:13:40,156
You didn't do anything wrong, Taran.

1432
02:13:40,886 --> 02:13:45,892
The other day, in the temple,
when I asked you why you chose me..

1433
02:13:47,159 --> 02:13:50,629
...you said 'I am
doing the right thing'.

1434
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:55,772
It's true that it's not my fault.

1435
02:13:57,636 --> 02:13:59,582
Also true that I love you.

1436
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:06,890
Maybe more..

1437
02:14:08,814 --> 02:14:10,691
...than you know.

1438
02:14:14,152 --> 02:14:17,599
But not more than you love Amar.

1439
02:14:20,726 --> 02:14:22,637
Love is not some
responsibility, Taran.

1440
02:14:24,630 --> 02:14:25,938
Love is not reasonable.

1441
02:14:27,032 --> 02:14:28,807
It just happens.

1442
02:14:29,167 --> 02:14:30,840
Only compromises are reasonable.

1443
02:14:33,105 --> 02:14:34,175
Fine, I won't go.

1444
02:14:38,076 --> 02:14:40,249
Look into my eye and say..

1445
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:42,984
...that you don't love Amar.

1446
02:14:46,118 --> 02:14:49,759
Say that every day you didn't
feel something shatter inside you..

1447
02:14:50,122 --> 02:14:52,193
...after you told Amar about me.

1448
02:14:58,330 --> 02:15:00,207
Say it Taran, and I won't go.

1449
02:15:02,834 --> 02:15:03,835
Say it..

1450
02:15:12,277 --> 02:15:14,314
Don't do the right thing, silly..

1451
02:15:15,881 --> 02:15:17,053
...fall in love.

1452
02:15:24,256 --> 02:15:25,929
It's my turn to do the right thing.

1453
02:15:29,227 --> 02:15:30,137
See you.

1454
02:16:05,197 --> 02:16:08,269
Smile..laugh..be happy..

1455
02:16:11,103 --> 02:16:11,945
Love...!
