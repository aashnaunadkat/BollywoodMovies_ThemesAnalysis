1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,512
"Mr Mauji walks far ahead,
close behind is his tail.

2
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,640
"The further he walks,
the shorter gets the tail."

3
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,817
All's good.

4
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,612
Here in the city and at home.

5
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,113
Less room here...

6
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,949
...but more stars to count
when falling asleep at night.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,284
Mauji!

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,454
Hey, Mauji!

9
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,707
See if there's water in the tap.

10
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,418
Fill a bucket for me.

11
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:26,961
Sure!

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,883
- Can't you hear me?
- Yes!

13
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,970
The tank is empty.

14
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,350
- Water pump working?
- It's fused.

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,894
The electrician is coming
to fix it tonight.

16
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,650
This is Mamta.

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,736
By law we're husband and wife,
but...

18
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,239
Mamta! Can you wash the pan
for me?

19
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,574
Let me give father
the bucket first, Ma.

20
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,993
Where is the coriander?

21
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,245
And this is father.

22
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,122
God has given him everything.

23
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,916
Dragging your feet again?
Pour it in!

24
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,210
Never enough water for his tank.

25
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,129
All he does is snore.

26
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,216
People take God's name at dawn
while my father only abuses.

27
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,136
But what can I say? It's all good.

28
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,809
Mamta, keep an eye on the stove.

29
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,771
There's Mamta. There's mother...

30
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,190
...good intentioned but nervous.

31
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,028
Her hands tremble if the bread
she serves is not hot and risen.

32
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,113
What can I say? It's all good.

33
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,614
The risen bread is for you.

34
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,200
Mauji, you have the cold one.

35
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,204
Mamta, iron his shirt.

36
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,751
Mamta and I couldn't get to know
each other before we married.

37
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,794
Now there's no time.

38
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,881
When the wedding was over...

39
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,759
...so was our chance to talk.

40
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,553
What can I say? It's all good.

41
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,682
This is Chhajjulalji.
My father's father.

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,559
My grandpa.

43
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,645
He used to be a skilled tailor
in the old days.

44
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,524
His business went bust,
leaving us without a rupee.

45
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,568
The shirt's torn.

46
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,195
I'll mend it.

47
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,113
Mamta, pack the tiffin box.

48
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,703
We have another family member,
"Usha's Sewing Machine."

49
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,373
Actually it belongs to our neighbour
Yogesh.

50
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,918
But he and his mother spend
most of the day here.

51
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,594
The oil this machine consumes and
the tea Yogesh's mother consumes...

52
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,014
...would fuel the verandah heater
for two months.

53
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,058
Uncle, why are you turning it off?

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,976
Want to catch a cold?

55
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,938
You'll fall sick going
from hot to cold.

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,942
Put your shoes on.
We'll miss the train.

57
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,778
Don't worry. I'll get there
before you.

58
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,866
Mauji! A dog is peeing on your cycle.

59
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,285
Your cycle is covered in dog pee!

60
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,172
This is my brother Jugnu. His wife
Kumud and their son Beenu.

61
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,549
You like the bike?

62
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,010
Kumud's brother, Guddu,
got it from the showroom...

63
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,053
...with a 5000-rupee discount.

64
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,179
Good morning, sister.

65
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,015
- Sister-in-law, here.
- You ok, Beenu?

66
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,975
There's milk in the bag.

67
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,769
Make sure he has it at 4. Ok?
We're leaving.

68
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,355
Beenu will ride the new motorcycle.

69
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:37,569
Hold the tiffin upright or else
the gravy will spill out.

70
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,155
And so the lunch box,
the water tank...

71
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,450
...the gas cylinder became
a wall between Mamta and me.

72
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,660
Neither of us could climb it.

73
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,316
- Greetings, Palteramji.
- Greetings.

74
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,943
PALTERAM
PAAN SHOP.

75
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,490
Say what you will...

76
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:28,036
...but all the artisans who barely
survived the handicraft shutdown...

77
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,705
...are living contentedly
in this neighbourhood.

78
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,975
Who knows what tomorrow will bring.
But today? It's all good.

79
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,216
Mauji, give me a hand.

80
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,012
Take it.

81
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,747
Long live Mother Ganges!

82
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,334
Naushad wants the money
for the new machines.

83
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,002
Call him here.

84
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,296
Yes.

85
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:03,965
Here.

86
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,097
Sir, I transported this lot
all the way from Bhiwani.

87
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,893
Used up my diesel driving. I greased
the palms of the border police.

88
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,979
No extra money for free goods,
Naushad.

89
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,274
If word gets out that he's selling
sewing machines the government...

90
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,651
...gives to the poor,
he'll be jailed.

91
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,279
- Very risky.
- This wont cover his bail.

92
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:31,159
He's doing us a good service.
Give him a little extra.

93
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,495
Must I pay for his toilet paper too?

94
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,705
- Go on, Bansalji.
- Here.

95
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,833
- Happy now? Go.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,757
Mauji, have you delivered
Parshant's wedding cards?

97
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,968
All done, to every corner.

98
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,930
- Parshant came with me.
- Wonderful!

99
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,433
You'll have lots to do
at the wedding.

100
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,269
Parshant is like a brother.
I'd do anything for him.

101
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,658
What's wrong?
Why are you sulking?

102
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,036
He knows why.

103
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,915
Ask this scumbag.

104
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,002
- He drove my new bike into a pole.
- Really?

105
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,255
Parshant sat behind with a bag
stuffed with chicken meat.

106
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,966
Two crazy dogs chased us.
Ask him.

107
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,011
The dogs were salivating
when they smelt the meat.

108
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,639
The faster I went,
the faster they ran.

109
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,018
One of the dogs grabbed
my trousers violently.

110
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,355
I kicked the dog and it went
flying to one side.

111
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,109
The bike crashed into a pole
and I landed in the gutter.

112
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,610
All true.

113
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,280
Here is my son's wedding invitation.

114
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,824
Bring the family with you.

115
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,452
There's a separate card for Jugnu.

116
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,662
Hold it between your teeth.

117
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,545
Today your daughter goes
to the in-laws.

118
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,549
Just be like yesterday...

119
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,052
Ma, bring some water for father.

120
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,096
...she used to wipe her nose
with my shirt.

121
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,934
If you're so emotional,
why watch these wretched soaps?

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,937
Suman is marrying a government
employee.

123
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:28,026
He'll keep her happy.
You don't have to worry.

124
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,445
Get me some pickles.

125
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,697
Pickles for father.

126
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:34,949
Papa!

127
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:39,287
Whose noise will groan in this house
after today?

128
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,040
Enough!

129
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,043
Mamta, soak the kidney beans.

130
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,295
No cooking tomorrow.

131
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:52,050
Uncle Bansal's son is getting
married. We're invited.

132
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,886
Jugnu has a separate invite.

133
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,055
Go with Mamta and give it to him.

134
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,266
Why are you sending them out
this late?

135
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,476
You go!

136
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,269
I'm not going near that house.

137
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,815
Is this right? Two wedding invites
for the same family?

138
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,609
Jugnu insisted on living
with his in-laws.

139
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,611
So, where's the harm in that?

140
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,279
What's wrong?

141
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,950
You weep like a child when a girl
leaves home in a TV soap...

142
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,161
...and didn't bat an eyelid
when your own son left.

143
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,874
Mauji, listen. Mamta says
she won't attend the wedding.

144
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,418
What's her problem?

145
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,421
Her pretty blouses are too loose now.

146
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,091
Measure her. I'll take them in.

147
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,946
It's done. Anything else?
The sewing machine is threaded.

148
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,323
No, that's all.

149
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,868
Try it on now.

150
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,125
You must eat.

151
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,211
Make sure the children eat too.

152
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,754
Greetings!

153
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,255
You show up now?

154
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,174
- I was at the back...
- There's much to do.

155
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,551
Where were you loafing around?

156
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,345
I brought father along.

157
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,638
Ok. Ok.

158
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,640
Can we get a group photo?

159
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,060
Some other time.
Go and set the dining table.

160
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,478
People are complaining.

161
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,522
Don't leave before you've eaten.

162
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,399
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

163
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,405
Prashant...

164
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,074
Put it down. Keep moving.

165
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,039
Father, I have work to do.
Eat without me.

166
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,752
Greetings, uncle.

167
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,006
- Mauji got me the catering contract.
- Really?

168
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,218
- What are you charging per head?
- Enjoy! It's free for you.

169
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,640
Mauji, come.

170
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,352
This is Mauji.
Papa's favourite worker.

171
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,272
Stay in his good books. Right?

172
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,818
He makes our clients laugh. You won't
cry when you leave home.

173
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,196
Come on, show her what you can do.

174
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,741
Come on, just once!

175
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,791
Here, Tommy!

176
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,670
Say hello to my bride.

177
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,510
Are you hungry?
Have some chicken. Here!

178
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,221
Go on! Chicken, chicken.

179
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,812
It's bread, not chicken!

180
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,735
He's all upset.

181
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,660
Mauji, chicken.

182
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,245
Come back.

183
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,508
You'll bite me?

184
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,553
Come back.

185
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,769
He's terrific, isn't he?

186
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,688
An original.

187
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,605
We gave them 151 rupees
as a gift...

188
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,774
...and earned 500 in return.

189
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,694
You must've done a good deed
in your last life...

190
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,698
...that's why Bansal hired you.
Just be grateful.

191
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,161
Even Parshant treats me
like a younger brother.

192
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,898
What is it? Not sleepy?

193
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,446
The boss pays, so he will have
his fun, won't he?

194
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,990
No big deal.

195
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,994
I was humiliated not you.

196
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,332
You or me, it's the same thing.

197
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,670
Mamta...

198
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,301
Forget it.

199
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,721
People enjoy a laugh
at a wedding.

200
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,225
You act like a doggie every day?

201
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,185
You crazy?

202
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,937
A doggie every day?

203
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,732
Sometimes I'm a monkey,
or a bull or a dancing bear...

204
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,442
Done it all.

205
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,741
Can't you find some other work?

206
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,912
Earn less, but you won't be
humiliated like this.

207
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,831
Should I join a circus?

208
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,208
Is buffoonery your only talent?

209
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:47,924
Mamta...

210
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,137
I'm too old to learn a new skill.
What choice do I have?

211
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,347
Start your own business.

212
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,017
You're so talented.

213
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,482
When our marriage was being settled...

214
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,194
...I noticed the fine waistcoat
that you were wearing.

215
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,240
You sew so well for the family.

216
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,826
You could sew for others.

217
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,291
Have you lost it?

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,961
Grandfather was a tailor.
He lost everything.

219
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,505
Father got a job to feed us.

220
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,342
And you want me to jump back
into that hell?

221
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,929
Don't ever mention it
in front of him.

222
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,682
He'll throw us out.

223
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,061
A tailor? As if!

224
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,416
Where's Mauji?

225
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,127
I'll check.

226
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,382
Breakfast?

227
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,476
Are you doing the accounts?

228
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,521
Go and meet Gupta and Verma.

229
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,564
Don't mix up their accounts.

230
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,317
Pay attention to your work.

231
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,153
That's the problem.

232
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,697
Mauji.

233
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,909
Hey Mauji!

234
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,871
Can't you hear?

235
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,209
Take this to Gupta's shop.
Get him to sign for it.

236
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,627
Collect the cash.

237
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,505
Can I have your bike keys?
I'm carrying cash back.

238
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,048
I don't want to lose it.

239
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,967
Want an airplane instead?

240
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:59,055
Be honest. You want to take
your wife for a spin, eh?

241
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,767
Taking her some place
where you can get it on?

242
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,728
Don't talk like that.

243
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,523
Bansalji, settle my accounts.

244
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,318
You want your wages?
But the month has just started.

245
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,488
I'm done. I'm not in the mood
to hear another joke.

246
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,824
What are you in the mood for?
Enlighten us!

247
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,910
I told you to shut your mouth!

248
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,540
- How dare you!
- Remember your place! Moron.

249
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,335
He's talking about my wife.

250
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,253
- And you say nothing?
- He's only joking.

251
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,171
So what!

252
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,214
Leave the shop keys here
and get out!

253
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,425
I'll thrash you in front of everyone.

254
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,052
You scumbag!

255
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,554
You dare talk to the boss like that?

256
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,848
Does he have a monopoly
on hitting people?

257
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,185
Your son's turned red
and I haven't even touched him.

258
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,734
Call the police.

259
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,944
You low life!

260
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,698
- Stuff it! I don't want your job.
- Get him out of here.

261
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,368
You won't get another job.
You'll starve.

262
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,911
Your blasted keys!

263
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,457
Bijender, how much will you eat?

264
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,043
Offer some to the guests.

265
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,924
Some tea.

266
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,056
There's no need for all this.

267
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,311
I was unmarried when
I started work here.

268
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,857
Parasamji looked after us
like his own children.

269
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,027
There was always water on the table.

270
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,737
At one sharp...

271
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,615
...a lunch box with hot food
would appear.

272
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:45,203
The meals were Deshraj's responsibility.
I just did the cleaning.

273
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,629
Still mad at me?

274
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,757
No, I'm fine.

275
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,513
You don't have to hesitate
telling everyone...

276
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,100
...my husband is unemployed
and sits at home all day.

277
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,356
- What did you do?
- I quit my job.

278
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,442
Attention, everyone!

279
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,737
Now Beenu will recite a poem for us.

280
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,071
Go on, Beenu.

281
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,197
"A paper boat.

282
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,615
"A house of brick.

283
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,951
"Grandpa takes care of us.

284
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,995
"I'm his mouse, he's my elephant.

285
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,705
"Everyone calls him Bauji.

286
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,665
"My sweet grandpa."

287
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,711
Uncle, great news.

288
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,963
No more getting up early.

289
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,799
No more shouting for water
and waking us all up!

290
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,552
I've retired but not from life, son.

291
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,055
I'll pick Beenu up from school...

292
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,514
...help him with his homework...

293
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,559
...teach him maths and tables.
That's my responsibility now.

294
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,020
Mamta can teach him, father.

295
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,523
You should do what you've
always wanted to do.

296
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,108
What's that?

297
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,819
Do what you really want to do.

298
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,488
Morning walk?

299
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,116
No. Make your dreams come true.

300
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,243
You mean stay in bed?
That's your dream, son.

301
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,204
Just hear me out.

302
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,916
Oil your rusty tools,
here's your chance.

303
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,168
Take up your old trade.

304
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,212
Let us revive the family business.

305
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:21,007
I don't want my future generations
going down that road.

306
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:25,595
- Let us? Meaning?
- You've retired.

307
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,806
I can't bear working for Bansal.

308
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:28,848
To hell with them!

309
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,184
Let's start our own business.
50/50.

310
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,229
50/50? Who'll do your job?

311
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,315
I've quit my job.

312
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,442
You quit.

313
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,029
Quit.

314
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,740
You quit your job?

315
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,876
Just see how he is scrubbing
his clothes.

316
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,504
He's getting all spruced up
to twiddle his thumbs at home.

317
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,465
- Where are the shop keys?
- I've returned them.

318
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,050
Poor Mr Bansal.

319
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,804
At his age, he'll have to get up early
to open the shop.

320
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:11,433
- The shutters must weigh 10 kilos.
- Be quiet!

321
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,978
Your son is jobless and you worry
about Bansal.

322
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,857
Why didn't he quit
when the month was up?

323
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,066
No, Ma.

324
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,278
No more kicks from the boss
for a few thousand rupees.

325
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,197
A few thousand?

326
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:30,326
I get it. So a few thousand
is nothing to you?

327
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,537
You're eyeing my savings.

328
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:37,667
I'll have a pension of 250,000
and you'll enjoy it. So why work?

329
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,503
No, father, I don't want your money.

330
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,088
Keep it.

331
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,549
Mamta, make him see sense.

332
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:52,182
We came from the village to the city
for a better life.

333
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,812
If we can't earn in dignity here,
there's nowhere for us to go.

334
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,567
Let him do what makes him happy.

335
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:10,867
"A paper boat.

336
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,160
"A house of brick.

337
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,745
"Grandpa takes care of us.

338
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,997
"I'm his mouse, he's my elephant.

339
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,833
"Bauji is what they all call grandpa.
My sweet grandpa."

340
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,592
Get me a tea!

341
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,010
Me, too.

342
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,428
It's not even 9.

343
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,555
And that's his third cup.

344
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:36,226
Father, you read this.
Let me read your paper.

345
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,521
Don't touch! Buy your own paper
with your own earnings.

346
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,816
Ok. Keep your wisdom to yourself!

347
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,242
Mother has had a fall.

348
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,077
Amma!

349
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,870
She's in the kitchen.

350
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,039
What happened?

351
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,003
No one has filled the water tank
this morning.

352
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,755
So many dirty pans.

353
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,549
When will that milk boil?

354
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,593
I must make their breakfast.

355
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,513
Get your breath back, Ma.
Forget all that.

356
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,807
- Want to see the doctor?
- No.

357
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,060
Give me some mango powder.
It's just gas. I'll be ok.

358
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,859
Your home remedies will end up
killing you.

359
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,110
Call Bijender.

360
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,279
Ask him to bring his rickshaw here.

361
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,031
The mango powder isn't helping.

362
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,658
Give me some lemon pickle.

363
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,995
Call Guddu from my phone.

364
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,038
Hurry.

365
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,291
Bijender is on his way.

366
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,585
- Ma, let's go.
- I'll be ok.

367
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,004
Want to die with a pan glued
to your hand?

368
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,839
I'll be all right.

369
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,425
I don't want to go to hospital.

370
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,469
Find out where it is. Go!

371
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,179
Where should we go?

372
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,682
Ask over there.

373
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,444
It's nothing.

374
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,822
It's just gas. Give her some
papaya and she'll be ok.

375
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:16,659
If you're as smart as a doctor,
how come you drive a rickshaw?

376
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,746
Satpal's son was ill, too.
His lines went up and down like this.

377
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,498
So you're expert at lines?

378
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,584
Listen. Look! My hand is stuck.

379
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,629
- You brought a jar of pickles?
- Ma asked me to.

380
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:30,465
- Apply oil. It'll come out.
- The pickle has oil.

381
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,384
- So try cream.
- It didn't work.

382
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:36,388
- Pull harder.
- It's hurting.

383
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,682
Gently now.

384
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,266
Move.

385
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,435
Her hand is stuck.

386
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,104
I'm trying to get it out.

387
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,772
Try paraffin oil.
It'll slip out.

388
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,148
- Will that work?
- Absolutely.

389
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,484
Move aside, please.

390
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:56,032
She's had a heart attack...

391
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:58,702
...and has two blocked arteries.

392
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,080
She seems very stressed.
Are there problems at home?

393
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,458
What do you expect when her
grown son sits idle at home?

394
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,585
Father has just retired.

395
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,295
That stressed her out.

396
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,674
Bravo, son! I can pay the bill
but don't blame me for her ill heath.

397
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:16,970
Carry on bickering and you'll
block her good arteries too.

398
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,474
Doctor, what shall we do?

399
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,352
She needs an angio.
Admit her to hospital.

400
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,062
My heart is fine.

401
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:29,399
If I walk every day, I'll get better.

402
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,859
What shall we do?

403
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,068
Ma...

404
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,157
I'm the one with the heart attack. But
they've gone deaf. They won't listen.

405
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,783
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

406
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:42,412
Aunty, don't worry. No waiting charge.
I'll take only 250.

407
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,623
This is no time to talk about money,
Bijender.

408
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,959
- Can't you see the situation?
- Sorry.

409
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,502
Go with them.

410
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,130
Deposit 5,000 advance.

411
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:55,800
She'll be under observation tonight.
Surgery tomorrow. OK?

412
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,265
I don't have 5,000.

413
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,394
Stay with mother. I'll arrange it.

414
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:07,562
Listen.

415
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:11,608
Take Mamta with you. She must
fill two buckets of water at 4pm.

416
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:23,244
Three teas and some biscuits!

417
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,580
Forget it.

418
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,167
Shall we go home?

419
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,127
Come on.

420
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,013
I told everyone I'll start
my tailoring business.

421
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:46,226
But the rent for a tiny shop
is over 10,000 rupees.

422
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,897
How long has he been here?

423
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,651
He's been here since
the bazaar opened.

424
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:01,574
- He owns this spot?
- The Municipality does.

425
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,370
- Does he pay rent?
- No.

426
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,998
- Electricity?
- No.

427
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,378
- Does he have any helpers?
- No.

428
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,970
- What do you have in mind?
- Nothing.

429
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,306
Are you saying I should set up
a shop here?

430
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,601
No, you're saying it.

431
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,193
Is it demeaning for you?

432
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,696
No.

433
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,702
Didn't you admit Ma?

434
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:51,666
She's just as stubborn as you.
Who listens to me here?

435
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,297
Are you all right?

436
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,258
Want some tea?

437
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,845
It's cold, Ma. Shall I make
your bed?

438
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,601
You didn't like the hospital?

439
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,395
Feeling better?

440
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,427
Wake up! Still sleeping?

441
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,846
My shop opens today. Who will
come with me?

442
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,976
Mamta, get some tulsi leaves
for my tea.

443
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:58,108
Grandpa, you come. I'm trying
to revive your legacy after all.

444
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,485
God spare us from a son like you.

445
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:05,824
Grandpa probably said that about you.
Shall we go, grandpa?

446
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,506
Mauji! You here?

447
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,050
Sorting my life like you.

448
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,052
Congrats! Where's that from?

449
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,762
The scrap dealer.

450
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:42,110
All set? Ready to count pigeons?

451
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,450
- Greetings, Yogeshji.
- Greetings, sister.

452
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:01,046
You can't go hungry on your first day
at work. It's not right.

453
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:03,715
Sit down.

454
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,225
Here.

455
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,064
If I said I was bringing you food
father would start nagging.

456
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,774
So I didn't tell them.

457
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,988
Bring the lunch box home.

458
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:28,907
Listen.

459
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,576
- Have you eaten?
- No.

460
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:35,789
Eat with me. There's enough
to feed the whole market.

461
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,126
How much is the bill?

462
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:41,878
Make me a cup of tea.

463
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,673
Why have you got the light on?
Switch it off.

464
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,717
You drink two packets
of milk every day...

465
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,970
...if you can't deal with life,
start drinking alcohol.

466
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,306
That would last longer.

467
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,476
Is alcohol free?
Get me a bottle then.

468
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:01,815
What is it?

469
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:12,117
Since we got married this is the
first time we're eating together.

470
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,451
Oh no!

471
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:17,455
If you start crying over nothing,
how will we manage? Eat.

472
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,252
It's tasty.

473
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:32,887
- The pickle makes it tastier.
- Aunty, your pickle smells delicious.

474
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,390
- Want some?
- Yes!

475
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,526
Ask your customers to get their
torn clothes mended here.

476
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,738
Tell the other shopkeepers you're here.

477
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:53,992
They won't know you've set up
shop here.

478
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,025
I don't see Rakesh and Vinod today.

479
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,778
There's Vinod.
See how he's hopping.

480
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,614
That isn't Vinod. It's Kaushalya.

481
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,241
She's pregnant.
Her man has dumped her.

482
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,660
Men can't be trusted.

483
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,663
Here you are.

484
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,920
Yes, Mamta?

485
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,174
Mother has fallen again.
We're going to the hospital.

486
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:52,467
What?

487
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,968
Meet us there.

488
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,012
I'm on my way.

489
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:59,724
Keep an eye on my things.
My mother has had a fall.

490
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:06,231
- It's a good job...
- But he won't agree.

491
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:07,607
Father!

492
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:11,695
- What happened? Is she ok?
- Yes.

493
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:14,114
I've admitted her.
Tomorrow's the operation.

494
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,991
I've managed to pay the deposit.

495
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:18,993
They'll keep her overnight.

496
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,497
Bauji, you tell him.

497
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:25,000
Look, it's come out.

498
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,225
Ma refuses to take her medicine.

499
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,643
You ok, Ma?

500
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,688
This is more medicine
than the food I eat.

501
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,232
It'll make you feel better.

502
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:53,528
Go back to your old job, son.
Say sorry to Bansalji.

503
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:57,032
Your father is losing a mountain
of hair worrying about you.

504
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,325
His hair has blocked the drain.

505
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,953
At his age, he doesn't need hair.

506
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,204
So what if he loses it!

507
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:06,583
You swore on her that
you'd keep her happy.

508
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,168
I am happy.

509
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:11,463
And if I weren't, so what?
He swore on me.

510
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:13,214
If bad luck comes my way...

511
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,008
I'll deal with it.

512
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,887
His life will be settled
once he gets a job.

513
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,310
Jugnu has some good news for Mauji.

514
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,937
He's a dutiful brother.
Tell him.

515
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,440
There's a new power plant
near Meerut.

516
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,150
They're hiring clerks.

517
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,153
Someone I know can help you.
Pay him a bribe of 150,000.

518
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,113
He'll make you a fake
school certificate...

519
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:38,698
...and you'll have the job.

520
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,034
I'm not leaving mother in this state.

521
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,787
What if something happens to her?
I'm staying put.

522
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,248
I beg you. We don't need
a jobless son.

523
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,459
Give him time, father.

524
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,545
When the business takes off,
we'll be fine.

525
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:56,883
By then we'll be burning on the funeral
pyre. He could sew our shrouds.

526
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,927
You're still alive so tell me...

527
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,512
...any embroidery on your shroud?

528
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,640
Visiting hours are over!
Squabble outside.

529
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,350
Who stays with her tonight?

530
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,476
Let's go.

531
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:12,399
Mamta, borrow an old salwar-kameez
from Yogesh's mother for me.

532
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,485
Sleeping in a saree
is very uncomfortable.

533
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,825
Get me all the old sheets lying
around the house.

534
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,868
Let's solve mother's discomfort.

535
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:48,268
Add this here. And here.

536
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:53,481
Try the flowers here.

537
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,694
Good idea.

538
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,750
Look, Mamta.

539
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,629
Mamta!

540
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,923
It's done.

541
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:29,476
Ma isn't a widow yet. No white.

542
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,145
Let's add some colour.

543
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,276
If grandpa were alive, he would've
given me a coin.

544
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:42,238
Thanks to his generosity,
I had a full piggy bank as a kid.

545
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,610
It's lovely. Where did you buy it?

546
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:23,530
Mauji and Mamta made it.

547
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:30,036
Mother is losing blood.

548
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:33,248
She needs another transfusion.
You can donate blood downstairs.

549
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,750
- Downstairs?
- I'll go.

550
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:40,714
- What happened?
- The nurse didn't tell me.

551
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,675
A blood shortage?
Will pomegranate juice do?

552
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,014
- Come upstairs.
- What's wrong?

553
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,557
There is a crowd up here.

554
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,726
- Tell me what's going on.
- Please hurry.

555
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,437
- Are Jugnu and father upstairs?
- Yes. Hurry.

556
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,649
Please listen.

557
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,736
Look. He's here.

558
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:08,825
Be quiet!

559
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,704
- Is Ma all right?
- She's still in surgery.

560
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:14,914
They want to talk to you.

561
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:17,792
They want a dress just like Ma's.
Just a minute!

562
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:23,131
A maxi dress like Ma's. I told
them not less than 500 rupees.

563
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,761
OK! Pay me an advance.
Collect your maxi in two days.

564
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:31,264
You can give me the money.
Write your names down.

565
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:35,226
One by one. Write down your names
over there. Go!

566
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:47,447
- Will I get my maxi dress tomorrow?
- Yes!

567
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:50,200
Here. 3900 rupees!

568
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,871
3900 rupees.
Let's celebrate and have a paan.

569
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:58,917
Rejoicing over peanuts?
You've hardly won the lottery.

570
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:03,004
Nothing makes you happy.
Yogesh is more supportive.

571
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:04,923
He always stands by me.

572
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,425
Father, wait and see.
Today it's a 200.

573
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:10,095
500 tomorrow, soon it'll be 5000.

574
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,932
Yogesh, in this country
there is more demand than supply.

575
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,769
My business will boom.
Your jaw will drop.

576
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,062
Jaw will drop!

577
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:20,689
The operation went well.

578
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,273
She'll return to the ward
in half an hour.

579
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:23,233
Come.

580
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:24,567
Let's go.

581
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,570
If anyone wants a maxi dress,
give them Mamta's number.

582
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:32,283
And walk around the other wards
at night, they'll see your clothes.

583
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:34,244
We might get more orders.

584
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,705
I'm going to the cloth market now.

585
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:02,022
Like a cold chill,
like a high fever.

586
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:05,275
Being in your company
is a curse I adore.

587
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:09,779
I may be losing my mind.

588
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:16,244
You're an addiction...

589
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,289
...stings like a wound.

590
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,710
Let's stay here...

591
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:27,339
...right here.

592
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:32,052
Never to return home again.

593
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:38,475
Let the world never find us.

594
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:45,648
You're an addiction...

595
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:48,568
...stings like a wound.

596
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:55,408
Bumpy roads ahead.
Go slow.

597
00:42:56,826 --> 00:42:58,495
Roads ahead...

598
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,415
...slow down!

599
00:43:04,876 --> 00:43:06,878
You're an addiction...

600
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,840
...stings like a wound.

601
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:46,418
With you by my side,
the world seems new.

602
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:53,049
Same old chores,
same old traditions.

603
00:43:54,592 --> 00:44:00,181
In broad daylight let us
illuminate the city.

604
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:06,771
Think what they will,
those old fashioned folk.

605
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,776
You're my sleep,
and awakening.

606
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:22,287
You're an addiction,
stings like a wound.

607
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:32,255
You're an addiction,
stings like a wound.

608
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:59,366
Wow! You're a hard-hitting batsman.

609
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:01,785
He's still overcharged us
by fifty rupees.

610
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:04,412
Here, sonny, another sixer!

611
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:06,664
What is it?

612
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,961
Nothing. It's the first time
you've praised me.

613
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,135
Want a biscuit?

614
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:22,263
Get us some biscuits!

615
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:24,057
Never mind.

616
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:26,059
Let it be.

617
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,646
Did you want one?

618
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,856
OK.

619
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:52,210
Sit down. I'll get you
some water.

620
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:55,130
You're...?

621
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:57,424
I didn't know when you'd be back.

622
00:45:57,757 --> 00:46:00,635
So I started cooking something
for Ma.

623
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:03,638
Father, where's the sewing machine?

624
00:46:03,888 --> 00:46:05,181
Yogesh took it back.

625
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:07,308
He said his mother needs it.

626
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:11,104
- I'll get it back.
- Drink your water first.

627
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,442
Father, let me do it.

628
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:18,778
I don't have the machine!

629
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,447
What do you mean?
I know it's inside.

630
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:21,448
You can't have it.

631
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,741
Is that Mauji shouting?

632
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,160
- Yogesh, I need it.
- Buy your own.

633
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:27,328
How dare you refuse!

634
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:31,374
- Don't force me.
- He doesn't want to give it.

635
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:32,834
I need it.

636
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:35,170
Don't force him, Mauji.

637
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:37,297
Mummy, close the door.

638
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,299
Call the police!

639
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:41,593
Why are you hitting my son?
Let go!

640
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:44,304
- Don't be so selfish, Aunty.
- We're selfish?

641
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:47,140
- Getting fat on our machine!
- Is that fair?

642
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:51,144
I haven't used it as much as your
greedy mother has slurped our tea.

643
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:52,228
How dare you!

644
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,563
- So?
- I'll fix you.

645
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:55,398
- You'll fix me?
- I'll break your...

646
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,649
Let go!

647
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:57,942
Stop him!

648
00:46:58,485 --> 00:46:59,569
What's he doing?

649
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:03,406
Parasram, just see! Your son
is making a scene.

650
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:04,741
Stop him.

651
00:47:05,116 --> 00:47:08,119
- Yogesh, careful!
- You beggar!

652
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:14,376
- Let him go!
- Stop!

653
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:16,211
What is this?

654
00:47:16,544 --> 00:47:18,213
What's going on?

655
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,465
What happened?

656
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,592
You're wise, you decide.

657
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:25,387
Tell me where can you get
a machine for free?

658
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:30,016
All I said was - we're neighbours,
so let's settle it amicably.

659
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:33,061
You earn 100, give me 40.
Think of it as machine rental.

660
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,730
40? You mean 40 punches?

661
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:37,732
Father will get hurt.

662
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:41,736
Father will get hurt!

663
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,658
Let's go home.

664
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,535
Stuff your machine up your...

665
00:47:48,993 --> 00:47:51,454
How much more shame will you
bring on us? Go home.

666
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,543
Come, child.

667
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,783
Will I get my dress tomorrow?

668
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:38,043
You should be happy, Parasram.

669
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:42,005
The boy is trying to revive
his grandfather's legacy.

670
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:45,258
We all gave up years ago.

671
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:48,678
If you're so proud of Mauji
and his wife, adopt them.

672
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:50,555
Have a paan.

673
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,102
This is not a trade that bears fruit.

674
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:59,814
This tailoring nonsense has ruined
the neighbourhood.

675
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:03,151
How will you return the advance
to those poor patients?

676
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:05,111
Forget it, Bauji.

677
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:07,864
Enjoy the paan, don't count
the ingredients.

678
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:41,314
Morning, father.

679
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:55,453
- If you're free, come with me.
- Where to?

680
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:57,080
Come.

681
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:58,581
Naushad!

682
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,459
What is it?

683
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,170
Lend me a machine for one day.
I'll return it tomorrow.

684
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:05,505
You nuts?

685
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:08,508
If we unpack it,
Bansal won't buy it from me.

686
00:50:08,883 --> 00:50:12,429
Sell it to us. We'll pay you later.

687
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:14,681
It's not easy getting these
free machines.

688
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:17,267
You have to stand for hours
in the sun...

689
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:19,978
...at a sports complex
40 kilometres...

690
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,022
...across the state border.

691
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:24,899
Mauji!

692
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:26,693
Mauji!

693
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:28,570
Mauji!

694
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:40,016
There it is.

695
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:51,820
Can I sign up for a sewing machine?

696
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:54,280
Get a token from the back
and join the line.

697
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:07,877
"Attention. Token numbers 250 to 300.

698
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:12,924
"Token numbers 250 to 300.
Please stand in line."

699
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,176
"Thank you."

700
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,682
When will we get a machine?

701
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:22,392
Pass a test first.

702
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:23,601
A test?

703
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:27,022
Only people who know how to sew
can get a sewing machine.

704
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:29,065
Take this number and sit down.

705
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:31,651
When your number is called,
join the line.

706
00:52:31,943 --> 00:52:34,070
- When's that?
- They'll call.

707
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:35,697
Your name?

708
00:52:35,947 --> 00:52:36,531
Mauji.

709
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:39,034
Not you! Keep moving.

710
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:45,040
"Token numbers 401 to 450!

711
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,960
You must wash your cut.

712
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:52,464
- But where?
- Let's ask.

713
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:56,384
There's a dispensary nearby.
Get yourself bandaged there.

714
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,679
Our number will not
be called immediately.

715
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,222
I'll wait here.

716
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:02,849
Go.

717
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:12,359
"A cycle key has been found.

718
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:17,447
"The owner must collect it
from our desk."

719
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:29,709
Move aside.

720
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,840
- I hurt my foot...
- Have you got a form?

721
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:37,050
No form.

722
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,177
- Sit over there.
- Some iodine...

723
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:41,179
Sit down. I'll call you.

724
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:47,519
"We've found a 4 year-old toddler
who says his name is Parveen...

725
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:50,438
"...and his mother's name is Rajkumari.

726
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:55,026
"His mother must come
and collect her son."

727
00:53:56,027 --> 00:53:57,237
Can you...

728
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,698
I have patients. Can't you see?

729
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:03,576
We'll attend the wedding without
an invitation.

730
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:09,666
"Token numbers 651 to 700.
Stand in line.

731
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,960
"No overcrowding.

00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:16,006
"Only those called should join
the queue.

733
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:18,299
"The others must wait."

734
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:21,177
Some iodine, please.

735
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:24,264
- I told you to wait.
- It's just over there.

736
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:26,057
I'll miss my number.

737
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,183
I've come from far.

738
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,102
- Where's the form?
- I don't have a form.

739
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:31,479
Your number has been called.
Join the line.

740
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:35,775
- My husband isn't here.
- No problem. You can join the line.

741
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,703
Take this to the doctor
then come back.

742
00:54:47,912 --> 00:54:50,040
Someone stop him!

743
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,627
I just wanted some iodine.

744
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:56,129
Let go.

745
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,593
- What are you doing?
- Here, stuff it!

746
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:08,266
My husband is at the dispensary.
Can I wait for him here?

747
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,894
If you don't want to go in,
then return the token.

748
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:13,646
Get another token when he returns
and queue again.

749
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,065
Now go.

750
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:44,302
"Will everyone kindly take their seats?

751
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:47,138
"The test is about to start.

752
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:52,018
"Take your seats and thread
the sewing machine."

753
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:12,455
Sir!

754
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:14,082
What is it?

755
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:17,210
- They've called my number.
- Where's your token?

756
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:18,753
My wife has it.

757
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:21,423
If you don't believe me,
come with me. It's the truth.

758
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:25,719
Go and find the senior officer
over there. Talk to him.

759
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:27,929
Now move aside.

760
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:31,016
Keep moving!

761
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:41,609
"Take the bobbins out
and wind thread in them.

762
00:57:15,393 --> 00:57:17,604
"Take the cloth from under
the table...

763
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:21,399
"...and make a pillow case
within ten minutes."

764
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,569
"The cloth is under the footrest."

765
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:02,000
"Time is nearly up. Hurry!"

766
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:04,419
- How long to go?
- Five minutes.

767
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:12,552
"Those making pillow cases
must hand them over here.

768
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:16,931
"The next group is ready
for their test."

769
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:24,689
"Now leave the hall."

770
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:27,359
"Your time will be up in 30 seconds."

771
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:38,578
Here's your coupon.
Get the machine from there.

772
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,248
Your coupon. Collect the machine.

773
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:48,797
Don't start crying! They'll think
you've never seen a machine before.

774
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,758
Move along. Take your sewing machine
from over there.

775
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,089
Give these out.

776
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,592
Here, Aunty. Your maxi.

777
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:44,936
- How much for the stent?
- 64,000 rupees.

778
01:00:45,228 --> 01:00:46,354
64,000.

779
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:48,815
25,000 for the bed.

780
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:52,527
What is it?

781
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:55,822
They used an imported stent.
The bill is huge.

782
01:00:56,197 --> 01:00:58,241
- How much is it?
- 150,000.

783
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:00,368
- 150,000?
- Yes.

784
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,164
Why didn't they ask first?

785
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:06,750
They told Ma the stent was imported.

786
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:08,418
She gave her consent.

787
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:11,880
They won't discharge her
till we pay.

788
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:19,220
- That won't cover a week's medicine.
- Keep it.

789
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:21,306
Call Guddu. He recommended
this hospital.

790
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:22,390
Boo!

791
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,435
Scared?

792
01:01:27,562 --> 01:01:29,814
What is it?
You're as pale as a ghost.

793
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:32,192
He's worried about the bill.

794
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:33,985
How do we find the money, Guddu?

795
01:01:34,277 --> 01:01:37,447
Don't whine on about money!
I must see my dear mother first.

796
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:39,407
She owes me blessings
for the New Year.

797
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:43,119
Mahesh, all well?

798
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:46,539
Doctor, how are you?
Haven't seen you for ages.

799
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:49,709
How are you? Miriam, right?

800
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:53,755
Yes, Jogiji?
I'll call you in ten minutes.

801
01:02:00,011 --> 01:02:01,971
Amma, Guddu is here.

802
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,394
She looks weak.

803
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:09,688
They unblocked one artery.

804
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:11,398
One more to go.

805
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,525
They said I must come back.

806
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:17,028
Mamta pack her things....

807
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,447
...I'll handle the bill.

808
01:02:22,992 --> 01:02:25,078
Guddu is here. Now smile!

809
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:28,331
Yes, Kumud?

810
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,835
I'm off now. Give me an apple!
Forget it!

811
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:34,796
- Let's step on it.
- Guddu, the bill...

812
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:36,131
Namaste, Panditji.

813
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:37,841
Namaste, Guddu.

814
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,635
I was calling for your file.

815
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,472
Get me Guddu's daily reports.

816
01:02:48,893 --> 01:02:51,229
Nothing wrong with the file.

817
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,945
Did you make the maxi dresses
for the patients?

818
01:03:01,156 --> 01:03:04,200
Bravo! The doctor thought
they were great.

819
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:08,121
- How many orders did you get?
- Fifteen.

820
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:09,914
It's not allowed, son.

821
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:14,502
Are you here for your mother's
treatment? Or to start a business?

822
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:18,631
Next there'll be someone hawking
samosas and tea.

823
01:03:19,257 --> 01:03:21,468
This is not a railway station.
It's a hospital.

824
01:03:21,843 --> 01:03:24,387
He's a foolish boy.
I'll explain things to him.

825
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:26,556
I'll calm him down.
Please look at the bill.

826
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:31,936
It looks OK to me.

827
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:34,939
I haven't earned this much
in my whole life.

828
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,317
Panditji, you're a magician!

829
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:42,614
Just press a few buttons and reduce
the number of zeroes.

830
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:48,787
Go outside. Let me handle it.

831
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:50,121
Let me.

832
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:54,793
Give me 70,000.
Panditji has halved the bill.

833
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,378
Bauji.

834
01:03:56,795 --> 01:03:59,422
Tell Mamta. Take our mother home.

835
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:01,049
Guddu, get a receipt.

836
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:04,010
Must I teach you the ways
of the world?

837
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:09,432
Who gives a receipt for a shady deal?
Come with me.

838
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:12,310
Panditji wants to talk to you about
the maxi dresses. Come!

839
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:14,020
We're downstairs.

840
01:04:14,854 --> 01:04:16,439
He has halved the bill.

841
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:18,608
Don't misunderstand Panditji.

842
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:21,528
He didn't say stop making maxis...

843
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:25,448
...he said make them through
my company. We'll supply them.

844
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:31,037
Panditji could've sent us a sample
and had us make exact copies.

845
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:34,582
What could you do?

846
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,752
Is your name on the label?
No, right?

847
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:41,715
You must think about your
mother's treatment.

848
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:45,051
Guddu, let him think it over.

849
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:49,222
His mother has another operation,
right?

850
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:51,266
You have a lot of time.

851
01:04:51,516 --> 01:04:53,685
Come back and have
tea with me.

852
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:58,023
He's so amusing.

853
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:22,297
Son, you saved us.
You've done us a great service.

854
01:05:22,547 --> 01:05:25,925
Nonsense, Bauji! You're my elder.
It's no service.

855
01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:28,428
My sister is married to your son.
We're family.

856
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,598
Your day was wasted in hospital.
Come home and rest.

857
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:36,227
I'll rest only when I've settled things
for Mauji.

858
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:39,981
When he has a job in the factory,
then I'll visit.

859
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:44,069
Not for a meal,
but a fancy imported drink.

860
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:47,197
Bye, Guddu.

861
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:49,949
Now you can smile!

862
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:52,243
Mother, call if you need me.

863
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:57,082
Don't think of us as strangers.
We're family.

864
01:05:57,457 --> 01:06:00,877
We've run around for our Amma, even
today when fasting on Karva Chauth.

865
01:06:01,586 --> 01:06:03,421
Amma, look after yourself.

866
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,215
Shall we go?

867
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:08,218
Why didn't you remind us to fast today?
It's Karwa Chauth.

868
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:11,137
We're fasting every day as it is.

869
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,140
Let's go inside.

870
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,393
Careful.

871
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:21,314
Stitch it properly.

872
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:24,317
Do it properly.

873
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:26,194
Don't use grey.

874
01:06:26,444 --> 01:06:28,154
Sister, this is Mauji.

875
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,323
- Who is he?
- The maxi guy.

876
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:33,326
Ah! Come here.
What's your name?

877
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:34,744
Mauji.

878
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:37,205
- And yours?
- Mamta.

879
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:39,791
Show the maxi.

880
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:46,131
Double seamed so it's strong.
It has panels for the drip and ECG.

881
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:49,426
This button lets you
undo the maxi easily.

882
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:51,511
How many orders have you got?

883
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:53,388
About 2000.

884
01:06:54,514 --> 01:06:55,682
Can you make them?

885
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:57,517
Sure.

886
01:06:58,059 --> 01:06:59,352
In three days.

887
01:07:01,062 --> 01:07:02,564
3 days? 2000?

888
01:07:02,605 --> 01:07:05,150
We don't deal in small numbers.

889
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,901
We are "Bedi Creations."

890
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:09,195
Been around for 40 years. Get it?

891
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:15,535
My father started this business
in a 4x4 shop.

892
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:17,620
And now look.

893
01:07:18,621 --> 01:07:20,457
Our ads were on the radio
all day long.

894
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:22,000
Guddu, remember...

895
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:25,128
"Everyone's passion,
that's Bedi Fashion."

896
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,464
"Bedi, Bedi, Bedi...

897
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,382
"...for grown ups and kids."

898
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:31,134
That's it! You know it?

899
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:33,845
- I've heard it.
- Yes! We're Bedi Creations!

900
01:07:35,472 --> 01:07:38,767
Readymade garments wiped out
the tailoring business.

901
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:42,395
She abandonned her design course
in the US to look after things here.

902
01:07:43,313 --> 01:07:45,565
Our story is much like yours.

903
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:47,901
Gave up a course in America too?

904
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:53,323
No, Madam, that's not what she means.

905
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:55,992
Never mind.
Take them to the supervisor.

906
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:58,036
Tell him about the maxi.

907
01:07:58,453 --> 01:08:00,455
Leave it here.

908
01:08:02,332 --> 01:08:03,625
I'll take it later.

909
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:05,126
Namaste.

910
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:10,298
This print is very nice.

911
01:08:11,007 --> 01:08:14,469
- Here's Guddu.
- Your luck has turned.

912
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:17,847
- You'll get what everyone gets.
- What's that?

913
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:21,559
8,000 rupees a month!
You're set for life.

914
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:24,562
You've got a job.
You should be happy.

915
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:28,942
No time to think now. Just work
as hard as you can.

916
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:31,736
Off you go.
You have a lot to do.

917
01:08:34,447 --> 01:08:35,615
All done.

918
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:42,497
Sitting under that tree is better
than working in the factory.

919
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,125
Yes.

920
01:08:46,626 --> 01:08:49,337
But we'd end up counting
pigeons there.

921
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:58,763
I don't have a good feeling
about Guddu.

922
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:05,937
Maybe madam Harleen
will treat us well.

923
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:16,072
Work here if you want to.
It's OK.

924
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:23,621
All of Bauji's pension will go
for mother's treatment.

925
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:27,125
There's so many other expenses.

926
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:31,713
Amma said she's feeling uneasy...

927
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:35,008
...and wants to hold
a prayer meeting at home.

928
01:09:37,302 --> 01:09:42,057
Pandering to Amma's wishes
will end up ruining us.

929
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:56,029
The bride is bathing.

930
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,198
She left her bracelet
in the bathroom.

931
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:02,702
Her mother-in-law took it
behind her back.

932
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:04,454
She won't return it.

933
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:10,043
We'll take the job.

934
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:36,236
Guddu brother!

935
01:10:36,986 --> 01:10:39,155
Why have you brought a sewing machine?

936
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:40,615
Praveen...

937
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:44,077
...take this to the warehouse.

938
01:10:44,744 --> 01:10:48,456
Ankita, we need two uniforms..
You won't need it.

939
01:10:48,873 --> 01:10:50,542
You are Truth.

940
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:52,961
You are Myth.

941
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:55,463
You are Truth.

942
01:10:56,297 --> 01:10:58,008
You are Myth.

943
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:02,095
Everything comes from You.

944
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:07,642
We fly aimless like birds.

945
01:11:08,643 --> 01:11:11,104
You are the light on our path.

946
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:17,569
You are the shore, the river,
the thirst.

947
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:21,114
You are silence and prayer too.

948
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,912
- Has the water come?
- Yes.

949
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:36,004
See, this is a pocket...

950
01:11:36,588 --> 01:11:38,381
The various sizes...

951
01:11:38,798 --> 01:11:42,052
You don't need this patchwork.
Nor this. Or this.

952
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:44,554
- But, Madam...
- It looks pretty.

953
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:47,140
Make the gown plain.

954
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:49,225
It's a hospital gown. Who'll see it?

955
01:11:49,267 --> 01:11:50,602
Mamta, come with me.

956
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:02,155
Scan this gown block
for the embroidery machine.

957
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:11,581
You may not heed me.

958
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:16,211
But I listen to Your every word.

959
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:17,671
Brother...

960
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:21,174
...this pattern looked good
on the maxi.

961
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:24,052
Madam wants the simple design.

962
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:27,347
She'll use this design
in the fashion collection.

963
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:32,018
Beyond all rites and rituals...

964
01:12:33,186 --> 01:12:36,064
...I will seek You out.

965
01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:39,734
You are colour.

966
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:42,320
You are colourless.

967
01:12:46,074 --> 01:12:49,536
A "Made in China" label
on our garments?

968
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:56,418
So? Must the label say "Ghaziabad?"
Who'd buy it?

969
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:00,088
This is India! This is how things work.
Back to work!

970
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:01,673
Great patriot!

971
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:07,095
You are the shore, the river,
the thirst.

972
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:10,432
You are silence and prayer too.

973
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:18,148
Guddu, put this photo in the Raymond
Fashion Fund application.

974
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:20,817
Let them see I am not alone.

975
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,902
The country is with me! Right?

976
01:13:23,194 --> 01:13:23,820
Yes!

977
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:24,946
Smile!

978
01:13:31,369 --> 01:13:32,287
Next.

979
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:36,249
20,000 rupees.

980
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:38,710
20,000? Last time
I paid a 5000 advance.

981
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,503
Who knows, uncle. Ask accounts.

982
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:42,088
It was 5,000...

983
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:46,885
Don't waste my time.
Ask upstairs. Move aside. Next.

984
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:54,768
They won't let Amma wear our maxis.
They want us to buy the hospital one.

985
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:58,146
OK. I'll talk to Panditji.

986
01:13:58,938 --> 01:14:00,065
Wait here.

987
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:07,947
Even the doctor pays the same rate
if he needs treatment here.

988
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:11,618
You have to pay for a maxi,
slippers etc.

989
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:14,579
And for many tests.
It's her heart after all.

990
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,664
She hasn't got the runs.

991
01:14:16,956 --> 01:14:21,544
You charge 2000 for the maxi and
buy it for 500. It's wrong.

992
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:23,922
No free beds here.

993
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:26,716
No free beds? But you said...

994
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:31,304
Panditji, don't get angry.
He's a foolish boy. I'll pay.

995
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:34,724
We have no free beds, Bauji.
Would I refuse you?

996
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,435
There must be one somewhere, Panditji.

997
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:40,438
Come.

998
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:16,349
We've been duped.
We lost the rights to our creations.

999
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:20,145
When our pockets were empty,
we were fearless.

1000
01:15:20,895 --> 01:15:23,523
Now we have money,
we're powerless.

1001
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:24,941
Hey Mauji...

1002
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:28,153
...there's an hour before lunch.
Get back to work.

1003
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:30,864
Outsmarted by the educated.

1004
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:35,410
We didn't realise our own worth.
We sold ourselves for peanuts.

1005
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:37,245
Delivery is for this evening.

1006
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:39,873
You have two bundles to go.

1007
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:45,837
What's up?

1008
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:48,548
- I want to talk to Madam.
- Talk to me.

1009
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:51,551
- Let me see her.
- She's busy. Talk to me.

1010
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,387
How much you charging
the hospital?

1011
01:15:55,388 --> 01:15:56,514
What's it to you?

1012
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,767
You get your wages. Be happy.

1013
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:01,770
Do that again and I'll smash
your teeth in.

1014
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:04,647
Come here! Rascal!

1015
01:16:05,273 --> 01:16:07,233
I don't talk to middlemen.

1016
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,444
Come here!

1017
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:15,367
We taught your workers everything.
Trusted you with our creations.

1018
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:18,411
- What's the fuss?
- Show the poor some kindness.

1019
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:19,537
Calm down!

1020
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:24,668
You gave the hospital another way
to rip off poor patients.

1021
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,545
How can they pay 2000 for
a 500-rupee maxi?

1022
01:16:27,837 --> 01:16:28,880
Go!

1023
01:16:31,174 --> 01:16:32,676
I said get out!

1024
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:34,052
Throw him out!

1025
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:36,471
Let go!

1026
01:16:36,721 --> 01:16:39,099
What's done is done.
What's the use of fighting?

1027
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:41,393
Don't butt in. I'm talking.

1028
01:16:41,851 --> 01:16:43,186
Get out!

1029
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:46,606
Let go!

1030
01:16:46,898 --> 01:16:48,441
Give me back my machine!

1031
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:51,403
- My sewing machine!
- There's no machine here.

1032
01:16:51,736 --> 01:16:53,154
My machine...

1033
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:54,989
Get out!

1034
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:58,743
- My sewing machine!
- Get lost!

1035
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,746
Take off his uniform. Damn thief.

1036
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:07,085
Teaching us how to run a business.

1037
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,878
Get out of here.

1038
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:12,674
He's just an animal.

1039
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:14,300
Out!

1040
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:31,192
See, Bauji?

1041
01:17:31,484 --> 01:17:32,944
How badly he was beaten.

1042
01:17:33,236 --> 01:17:34,946
He pulled a muscle in his thigh.

1043
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:38,700
He hammered Guddu's
back with his elbows.

1044
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:41,327
Guddu almost threw up blood.

1045
01:17:41,619 --> 01:17:44,164
I thought Mauji was a burden to you.

1046
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:48,418
I thought I'd help him,
instead he beats me up.

1047
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:51,046
Fine reward for my good deed.

1048
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:52,422
Guddu.

1049
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:55,508
Don't just stare. Go, get some water!

1050
01:17:56,259 --> 01:18:00,096
Everyone thought so highly of Guddu.

1051
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:03,099
How will Madam trust him?

1052
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:08,271
Tell him to go back with Guddu
and beg her forgiveness.

1053
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,858
You think I'm a low-life?
Con artists!

1054
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:17,405
We all know he and Panditji
swallowed half the hospital fees.

1055
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:19,366
You've made Jugnu into a puppet.

1056
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:23,203
Jugnu isn't a child! You keep him!
We don't need him.

1057
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:26,247
It's all my fault.

1058
01:18:26,873 --> 01:18:29,000
My parents married me
into a family of eunuchs.

1059
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:32,754
Speak up!
Stop being your wife's parrot.

1060
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:34,881
She's abusing us all.

1061
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:38,009
Talk to me, not him,
if you're a real man.

1062
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,555
I'm holding back.
I can be tough too.

1063
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:44,766
You're the toughest of the lot!

1064
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:47,811
How long will you be
your wife's lapdog?

1065
01:18:58,571 --> 01:19:00,031
It's OK, brother.

1066
01:19:02,325 --> 01:19:03,743
It's all good.

1067
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:09,541
Shown your true colours today.

1068
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:19,342
Let's go, brother.

1069
01:19:42,323 --> 01:19:45,535
Amma, how much bread shall I make?
Ask the others.

1070
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:54,294
Bauji, it's 9.
Shall I put on your TV serial?

1071
01:19:54,836 --> 01:19:58,757
Your husband has provided enough
entertainment.

1072
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:15,315
Father and son used to fight bitterly
over a newspaper.

1073
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:19,069
Today they are not bothered
about anything.

1074
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:22,405
By now they would've
finished three cups of tea.

1075
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:25,492
But nothing today.

1076
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:29,579
God knows when their fasting will end?

1077
01:20:58,024 --> 01:20:59,275
Get up!

1078
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:02,946
Go down. Make Amma eat something.

1079
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:05,073
She hasn't had her medicine.

1080
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:08,952
I could've fought them all yesterday
but you stayed silent.

1081
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:12,038
Fought? You were just hurling abuse.

1082
01:21:12,664 --> 01:21:15,375
Say sorry to Kumud.
She's younger than you.

1083
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:17,794
Why?

1084
01:21:18,628 --> 01:21:20,964
You asked me to quit my job
at Bansal's. I did.

1085
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:23,174
You asked me to work at the factory.
I did.

1086
01:21:23,216 --> 01:21:25,844
Now you're asking me to apologise.
Why should I?

1087
01:21:26,177 --> 01:21:27,804
You can't be right
all the time, Mamta.

1088
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:32,392
- Did I ask you to work at the factory?
- You encouraged me.

1089
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:34,811
You didn't want to count pigeons...

1090
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:37,981
You kept telling me there's was
no money for Amma's treatment.

1091
01:21:38,231 --> 01:21:39,774
That was true.

1092
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:43,069
It's not my fault
if you misunderstood me.

1093
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:46,740
It's never your fault.
It's always mine.

1094
01:21:50,076 --> 01:21:54,581
If you're so smart,
then you do something.

1095
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:05,800
Such an effort to get the machine.
Of course I'd fight to get it back.

1096
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:10,472
So you made the effort alone?

1097
01:22:24,944 --> 01:22:26,571
Have a biscuit first.

1098
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:27,739
Where's Mamta?

1099
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:30,450
No idea. In the bathroom, maybe.

1100
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:39,793
Wake up.

1101
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:42,087
How long will you lie there
like a corpse?

1102
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,756
Who'll make breakfast,
who'll wash the clothes?

1103
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:46,257
Think of us.

1104
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:50,929
- Maybe she's filling water?
- That's already done.

1105
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:52,639
Mamta!

1106
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:54,391
Mamta!

1107
01:22:56,142 --> 01:22:58,311
Did she go out?
It looks like it.

1108
01:22:58,561 --> 01:23:00,814
She must be picking Beenu
up from school.

1109
01:23:15,995 --> 01:23:19,624
- Beenu, won't you say hello?
- Mother said not to talk to dogs.

1110
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:21,167
Shut up!

1111
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:24,504
- Have you seen Mamta?
- No.

1112
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:37,976
You left it here yesterday.

1113
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:47,485
Do it properly.

1114
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:50,238
Don't spoil our name.

1115
01:23:57,078 --> 01:23:59,998
Please return our sewing machine.

1116
01:24:01,082 --> 01:24:03,835
We'll lose whatever work we had.

1117
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:06,129
Sister, I'm just an employee.

1118
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:08,423
No one listens to me here...

1119
01:24:08,965 --> 01:24:11,885
...especially not after yesterday.

1120
01:24:15,096 --> 01:24:17,932
- Let me speak to Madam.
- She's busy.

1121
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:22,312
The Fashion Fund deadline
is approaching.

1122
01:24:23,646 --> 01:24:24,939
Wait if you want.

1123
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:27,859
Talk to her if she comes out.

1124
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:42,749
If the award allows me to open
a shop, wouldn't I work hard?

1125
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:46,586
I've travelled to remote areas,
ones you've never heard of.

1126
01:24:47,128 --> 01:24:49,756
I found such beautiful things.

1127
01:24:52,008 --> 01:24:54,636
India has so many gifted artisans.

1128
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:57,013
They deserve a platform.

1129
01:24:57,639 --> 01:24:59,015
Please shortlist us.

1130
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,561
Thank you.

1131
01:25:04,145 --> 01:25:05,105
Madam...

1132
01:25:05,438 --> 01:25:07,273
I've come here to apologise.

1133
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:10,360
My husband behaved badly
yesterday.

1134
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:12,153
Let's go inside.

1135
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:24,249
It breaks my heart to see women
in your situation.

1136
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:28,628
It's only because of you
I didn't call the cops.

1137
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:32,924
Otherwise they'd have beaten up
Mauji till he saw stars.

1138
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:37,053
It was a mistake, Madam.
Forgive me.

1139
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:38,638
Don't be foolish.

1140
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:41,641
Don't talk like a meek little mouse.

1141
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:47,480
I was foolish asking my husband
to quit his job.

1142
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:53,153
I've never left the house before.

1143
01:25:53,778 --> 01:25:55,280
I was so naive.

1144
01:25:57,657 --> 01:25:59,701
But you've taught me so much.

1145
01:26:00,076 --> 01:26:02,787
That's why I say, "Don't quit."

1146
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:06,416
Join my Fashion Fund team.

1147
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,835
We'll be rich if we win.

1148
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:11,379
Then you can get a room of your own.

1149
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:13,882
You'll be in charge of your own life.
Let him rot.

1150
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:15,258
Get it?

1151
01:26:20,513 --> 01:26:26,144
I've seen my husband walk miles
carrying bundles of cloth on his back.

1152
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:33,651
He rides his cycle instead
of taking a bus in the hot sun...

1153
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:37,405
...so he can treat his father
to a paan.

1154
01:26:38,948 --> 01:26:42,535
Ask him, "How are things?"
He'll say, "It's all good."

1155
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:49,626
And he's right.

1156
01:26:51,169 --> 01:26:52,837
All is good.

1157
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:57,926
Had I not met you...

1158
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:03,306
...how could I have learned
the ways of the world?

1159
01:27:10,146 --> 01:27:11,147
Fine.

1160
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:14,859
Wait outside. I'll send you
your sewing machine.

1161
01:27:16,277 --> 01:27:17,278
Go.

1162
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:28,206
Guddu, she's coming out.

1163
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:31,001
Make her wait all day.

1164
01:27:40,593 --> 01:27:43,722
Mister, have you seen Mamta?

1165
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:47,434
She took the Delhi bus.
I dropped her at the stop.

1166
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:50,770
When's the next bus?

1167
01:27:51,187 --> 01:27:53,606
There it is. It leaves in ten minutes.

1168
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:59,904
The bus for Haridwar
is at stand number 2.

1169
01:28:03,783 --> 01:28:05,869
Why did you go out
without telling anyone?

1170
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:08,246
Know how worried we were?

1171
01:28:08,538 --> 01:28:11,541
If you didn't want to tell me,
you should've told Amma.

1172
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,918
Why punish her for my mistake?

1173
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:16,004
She has done you no harm.

1174
01:28:26,806 --> 01:28:28,099
OK. I apologise.

1175
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,560
I'll apologise to the whole world.

1176
01:28:30,977 --> 01:28:36,149
But I beg you, please don't cry
on the road like this.

1177
01:28:38,318 --> 01:28:41,905
You didn't make a mistake,
I did.

1178
01:28:42,655 --> 01:28:44,115
Forgive me.

1179
01:28:45,325 --> 01:28:46,576
What is it?

1180
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:56,461
I went to the factory to get
our sewing machine back.

1181
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,465
They didn't give it to me.

1182
01:29:04,969 --> 01:29:08,765
Now do you understand
why I hit Guddu?

1183
01:29:09,432 --> 01:29:11,518
He's just a yes-man.

1184
01:29:12,435 --> 01:29:15,438
No one in this city has any feelings.

1185
01:29:19,234 --> 01:29:23,363
Abusing others won't help you or me.

1186
01:29:25,407 --> 01:29:28,368
So what should we do?
Jump off a bridge?

1187
01:29:31,746 --> 01:29:34,165
If we want our dignity back...

1188
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:38,795
...then we must take part
in the fashion competition.

1189
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:43,717
We'll use our own name
to sell what we make.

1190
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:47,053
Are you mad?

1191
01:29:47,429 --> 01:29:51,391
We barely have enough to eat
and you want to take on a battle?

1192
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:12,037
All good!

1193
01:30:13,371 --> 01:30:16,416
If they hurl abuse at me,
let it be amid cheering.

1194
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:18,376
No point suffering in silence.

1195
01:30:19,627 --> 01:30:24,007
We better keep it from my parents,
or they'll throw us out.

1196
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:54,746
Greetings, Bauji.

1197
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:58,750
Here.

1198
01:31:05,173 --> 01:31:06,007
Bye.

1199
01:31:06,466 --> 01:31:08,259
What shall we call our company?

1200
01:31:08,885 --> 01:31:12,555
Made here, named here.
"Mad in India!"

1201
01:31:14,307 --> 01:31:18,061
Let's name our company
after what inspired you.

1202
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:22,732
"Chajjulalji Fashion?"
Sounds odd.

1203
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:29,614
"Mr Mauji walks far ahead,
close behind is his tail.

1204
01:31:30,907 --> 01:31:34,744
"The further Mr Mauji gets,
the shorter is the tail."

1205
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:37,747
What is it?

1206
01:31:39,165 --> 01:31:42,419
Could you lend me your sewing
machine for two days?

1207
01:31:44,337 --> 01:31:46,673
Will you make cardamom tea for me?

1208
01:31:48,633 --> 01:31:50,218
With samosas.

1209
01:31:53,555 --> 01:31:54,848
Give me the answer.

1210
01:31:55,098 --> 01:31:58,393
"Mr Mauji walks far ahead..."
Who walks behind him?

1211
01:31:59,019 --> 01:31:59,936
I'm busy.

1212
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:06,901
Bauji, try this one.

1213
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:10,113
"Mr Mauji walks far ahead,
close behind is his tail.

1214
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:12,949
"The further Mr Mauji gets,
the shorter is the tail."

1215
01:32:13,366 --> 01:32:14,659
Call this a riddle?

1216
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:16,578
- Don't tell him.
- A needle and thread.

1217
01:32:16,911 --> 01:32:18,913
Yes! "Needle & Thread."

1218
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:21,124
That's what we'll call our label.

1219
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:23,418
"Needle & Thread."
Mad in India.

1220
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:26,379
Make a company!

1221
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:35,764
"Needle & Thread."
Mad in India.

1222
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,034
Guddu!

1223
01:32:56,868 --> 01:32:59,079
- Are we selected?
- Of course.

1224
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:01,998
Team Needle & Thread.
Please come.

1225
01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:16,429
Show us your designs.

1226
01:33:23,186 --> 01:33:24,521
Put them on the bodyforms.

1227
01:33:26,731 --> 01:33:27,816
Over there.

1228
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:36,574
Sit down.

1229
01:33:40,704 --> 01:33:43,123
"Needle & Thread. Mad in India."

1230
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:45,417
No, "Mad in India."

1231
01:33:46,251 --> 01:33:49,129
- "Mad in India?"
- Yes, "Mad in India."

1232
01:33:49,963 --> 01:33:51,840
You mean "Made in India?"

1233
01:33:52,882 --> 01:33:55,885
"Mad in India" means it was
created in India.

1234
01:33:56,219 --> 01:33:58,680
"Mad in India" means crazy in India.

1235
01:34:01,766 --> 01:34:03,059
That's fine, too.

1236
01:34:03,476 --> 01:34:08,690
Enough crazies in India who dream
of trying their luck like us.

1237
01:34:09,065 --> 01:34:10,817
Making a few clothes is OK...

1238
01:34:11,109 --> 01:34:13,153
...but Raymond Fashion Fund
is for upcoming designers.

1239
01:34:13,903 --> 01:34:16,406
What if we selected you?
What then?

1240
01:34:16,865 --> 01:34:20,118
You need investment, infrastructure.

1241
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:22,996
You need manpower
to make a collection.

1242
01:34:23,455 --> 01:34:25,123
Can you do it?

1243
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:28,418
In our neighbourhood
we have many...

1244
01:34:28,918 --> 01:34:32,422
...artisans and craftsmen
who do menial jobs now.

1245
01:34:32,922 --> 01:34:33,965
We could...

1246
01:34:34,257 --> 01:34:37,010
- We'll get them to join hands.
- Yes.

1247
01:34:37,427 --> 01:34:39,804
We can make the collection.

1248
01:34:42,349 --> 01:34:44,100
We'll manage it.

1249
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,978
The prodigal son is here!
With sweets in hand.

1250
01:35:29,312 --> 01:35:31,022
He's read our minds.

1251
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:34,150
Bauji, we've been selected
for the fashion contest.

1252
01:35:34,442 --> 01:35:35,568
Will they pay you?

1253
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:38,488
We're struggling to do
better in life.

1254
01:35:38,738 --> 01:35:40,073
And all you think about is money.

1255
01:35:40,365 --> 01:35:44,536
They'll help us set up a garment
business and market our clothes.

1256
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:45,704
Wow!

1257
01:35:46,037 --> 01:35:47,872
Good news twice in one day.

1258
01:35:48,164 --> 01:35:50,250
My son worries about tomorrow...

1259
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:52,460
...and I've found a solution
for today.

1260
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:55,088
Distribute the sweets, son.

1261
01:35:55,797 --> 01:35:57,173
Father has a job.

1262
01:35:58,216 --> 01:36:01,386
He begged Omkar, the newspaper man,
for a job.

1263
01:36:01,886 --> 01:36:03,346
He'll deliver the papers.

1264
01:36:03,596 --> 01:36:06,850
He'll carry 40kgs on his cycle
at his age.

1265
01:36:08,476 --> 01:36:10,770
Mamta, have some. Go on.

1266
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:17,569
Come with me to Meerut.
I'll make the arrangements.

1267
01:36:18,028 --> 01:36:20,488
If you won't go alone,
take your wife.

1268
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:22,198
I'm here for mother and father.

1269
01:36:22,574 --> 01:36:24,617
If it's such a great job,
you take it.

1270
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:26,828
Leave your wife and son here.

1271
01:36:27,495 --> 01:36:30,040
They're your family. This is mine.

1272
01:36:30,331 --> 01:36:31,666
I'm staying put.

1273
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,670
I salute you, brother.
You're very brave.

1274
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,550
Then watch your parents die slowly.
Let father slog at his age.

1275
01:36:40,884 --> 01:36:42,677
You're braver than me.

1276
01:36:43,094 --> 01:36:44,971
Our parents adored Beenu.

1277
01:36:45,221 --> 01:36:50,310
But you made sure we had
no rights on him or on you.

1278
01:36:52,228 --> 01:36:54,981
You've never said a word
against him.

1279
01:36:55,357 --> 01:36:57,734
You saved your curses for me.

1280
01:36:58,318 --> 01:37:02,072
This is the first time I want
to achieve something...

1281
01:37:02,655 --> 01:37:03,948
...and you put me down.

1282
01:37:05,408 --> 01:37:07,243
What did you achieve in 40 years?

1283
01:37:07,494 --> 01:37:09,871
Your office celebrated when you
retired.

1284
01:37:10,163 --> 01:37:12,123
Got rid of the old man.

1285
01:37:12,624 --> 01:37:16,086
Your boss didn't even know
what you did.

1286
01:37:17,003 --> 01:37:19,673
Think yourself lucky she knew
your name.

1287
01:37:22,717 --> 01:37:25,011
We've been married so long.

1288
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:27,514
We should be grateful
she didn't leave.

1289
01:37:28,807 --> 01:37:30,850
She gave my life direction.

1290
01:37:31,643 --> 01:37:33,895
I held her hand
for the first time today.

1291
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:36,439
And I felt...

1292
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,443
...I was worthy of her.

1293
01:37:42,445 --> 01:37:44,197
Bauji, back us up once.

1294
01:37:45,448 --> 01:37:46,574
Just once.

1295
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:54,708
If we don't make it, we'll
take any job you suggest.

1296
01:37:58,211 --> 01:37:59,004
OK.

1297
01:38:00,213 --> 01:38:01,631
It's only a month.

1298
01:38:01,673 --> 01:38:05,885
Run after your dream while
I deliver newspapers.

1299
01:38:09,055 --> 01:38:11,307
But not a scrap of cloth
enters this house.

1300
01:38:11,349 --> 01:38:13,935
Cloth? You won't see a thread.

1301
01:38:16,062 --> 01:38:21,026
Amma, pray your two good arteries
stay unblocked for a month.

1302
01:38:22,068 --> 01:38:26,656
No time to get emotional now.
Be strong and keep praying!

1303
01:38:27,449 --> 01:38:29,534
Long live Goddess Sita.
Long live Lord Ram.

1304
01:38:34,998 --> 01:38:37,292
We need a work space to prepare
for the contest.

1305
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,503
Please try and understand.

1306
01:38:41,046 --> 01:38:43,548
Join us. It'll benefit us all.

1307
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:47,969
If you come to the mosque to ask,
how can I refuse?

1308
01:38:49,095 --> 01:38:51,473
- But don't sink the ship.
- It won't sink.

1309
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:54,100
Bring the goods.

1310
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:55,643
Go!

1311
01:38:56,478 --> 01:38:58,730
The Needle & Thread game begins!

1312
01:39:21,503 --> 01:39:25,131
Listen to life's song,
tick tock it goes.

1313
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:33,431
Fix faulty buttons,
fight bad times.

1314
01:39:37,811 --> 01:39:40,814
Listen to life's song,
tick tock it goes.

1315
01:39:41,856 --> 01:39:45,276
Fix faulty buttons,
fight bad times.

1316
01:39:45,902 --> 01:39:49,072
If fate's bedsheet gets frayed,
darn it with a...

1317
01:39:49,447 --> 01:39:50,990
...needle and thread.

1318
01:39:51,491 --> 01:39:52,992
Needle and thread.

1319
01:39:53,535 --> 01:39:56,996
The needle is upright,
the thread is dancing.

1320
01:39:57,831 --> 01:39:59,249
Needle & thread.

1321
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:05,005
The needle is upright,
the thread is dancing.

1322
01:40:06,506 --> 01:40:08,174
Palteramji, join us.

1323
01:40:08,425 --> 01:40:09,884
I'll follow my destiny.

1324
01:40:10,176 --> 01:40:11,845
Our business is doing well.

1325
01:40:12,137 --> 01:40:14,305
Business is good.
Why challenge God's will?

1326
01:40:14,556 --> 01:40:17,726
If fate's bedsheet gets frayed,
darn it with a...

1327
01:40:18,059 --> 01:40:19,436
...needle and thread.

1328
01:40:19,894 --> 01:40:21,396
Needle & thread.

1329
01:40:22,022 --> 01:40:24,649
The needle is upright,
the thread is dancing.

1330
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:28,028
We'll join you. But who'll convince
our husbands?

1331
01:40:28,778 --> 01:40:30,530
Take advantage of being a woman.

1332
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:38,621
Who are you?

1333
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:42,751
Why are you stirring up our wives?

1334
01:40:43,335 --> 01:40:45,420
- Palteramji?
- Yes.

1335
01:40:46,129 --> 01:40:48,423
Mauji, I took a vow...

1336
01:40:48,882 --> 01:40:51,926
...till we have kids, I'd turn my back
on the material world.

1337
01:40:52,302 --> 01:40:54,137
Your wife left me no choice.

1338
01:40:54,763 --> 01:40:56,765
Never mind the cooking...

1339
01:40:57,223 --> 01:40:59,601
...our wives shun us in bed now.

1340
01:40:59,893 --> 01:41:01,478
What are we supposed to do?

1341
01:41:01,895 --> 01:41:03,146
Join the team!

1342
01:41:11,529 --> 01:41:13,448
The rags of hard times...

1343
01:41:15,575 --> 01:41:18,078
...we darned together.

1344
01:41:23,667 --> 01:41:29,172
We made a soft pillow
for sleep to spread its wings.

1345
01:41:39,974 --> 01:41:43,395
Slam those doors in our faces!

1346
01:41:44,062 --> 01:41:47,232
See how wise we became.

1347
01:41:48,108 --> 01:41:53,697
Show some guts and muscle,
that'll zip their lips.

1348
01:41:56,282 --> 01:41:59,828
Our trials have made us tough
as nails.

1349
01:42:00,328 --> 01:42:03,957
Measure the long night
with our measuring tape.

1350
01:42:04,416 --> 01:42:07,419
If challenges tear us apart
we'll become a...

1351
01:42:07,919 --> 01:42:09,379
...needle and thread.

1352
01:42:09,796 --> 01:42:11,297
Needle & thread.

1353
01:42:11,923 --> 01:42:15,260
The needle is upright,
the thread is dancing.

1354
01:42:50,253 --> 01:42:53,214
Do not take insults to heart.

1355
01:42:54,341 --> 01:42:57,552
Salute those who beat us down.

1356
01:43:02,432 --> 01:43:05,810
Sarees made of silk or cotton.

1357
01:43:06,436 --> 01:43:09,689
Sew a proper hem on them.

1358
01:43:18,656 --> 01:43:22,327
Those dreams that you nurtured...

1359
01:43:22,744 --> 01:43:26,164
...cover them with a canvas.
Shelter them from the rain.

1360
01:43:26,831 --> 01:43:32,754
Frown upon the world's tantrums.
Just forge ahead!

1361
01:43:35,006 --> 01:43:38,301
Oil every machine spring
with your soul.

1362
01:43:39,094 --> 01:43:42,639
We've even made the machine
turn human.

1363
01:43:43,181 --> 01:43:46,559
If a pocket gets ripped,
patch it with a...

1364
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,688
...needle and thread.

1365
01:43:50,605 --> 01:43:54,109
The needle is upright,
the thread is dancing.

1366
01:43:57,862 --> 01:43:58,738
Well done!

1367
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:00,240
Hold it from the back!

1368
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,413
I'll just come.

1369
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:12,085
- I don't think he'll go.
- He will.

1370
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:18,925
You don't have to say it,
we know we have your blessings.

1371
01:44:19,426 --> 01:44:22,846
- But you must come with us.
- I am sorry, spare me.

1372
01:44:23,138 --> 01:44:25,223
You're talking to a brick wall.

1373
01:44:25,473 --> 01:44:29,519
Bauji, take your wife with you
or she'll sit behind the bus all day.

1374
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:31,563
Come, Bauji.
Or we'll miss the bus.

1375
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:34,858
Let's go, please.

1376
01:45:03,303 --> 01:45:04,304
Madam!

1377
01:45:05,055 --> 01:45:06,639
- Who are you?
- Team Needle & Thread.

1378
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:08,558
We're here for the competition.

1379
01:45:09,142 --> 01:45:10,810
Come! Follow me.

1380
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:13,271
Presenting Buttons and Bows.

1381
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,568
Come guys, quickly.

1382
01:45:18,818 --> 01:45:19,694
Come.

1383
01:45:21,529 --> 01:45:23,073
Faster, please. This side.

1384
01:45:23,448 --> 01:45:24,699
Yeah, yeah. We're here.

1385
01:45:25,241 --> 01:45:26,993
Ma, come. Carefully.

1386
01:45:27,535 --> 01:45:28,578
This side.

1387
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:30,372
Here.

1388
01:45:30,663 --> 01:45:32,582
Keep your luggage here.

1389
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:34,000
Hold it.

1390
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:38,213
Chinese garments ruined us before,
now their machines will defeat us.

1391
01:45:38,505 --> 01:45:41,132
If they have Chinese machines,
we have Indian hands.

1392
01:45:41,424 --> 01:45:42,967
- Soldiers!
- Yes!

1393
01:45:43,301 --> 01:45:46,429
No more Indian bragging!
Hurry. One hour to go.

1394
01:45:46,846 --> 01:45:49,391
These are her clothes.
Highlight her cheeks.

1395
01:45:55,438 --> 01:45:56,439
Naushad!

1396
01:46:01,653 --> 01:46:03,446
- This is yours.
- Do I look OK?

1397
01:46:04,656 --> 01:46:05,657
Enough.

1398
01:46:08,243 --> 01:46:09,369
Very nice.

1399
01:46:11,079 --> 01:46:14,666
Palteram, you can't wear that
inside. Not allowed.

1400
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:18,670
Bauji, what are you doing?
Comb your hair!

1401
01:46:19,629 --> 01:46:21,548
You can't go on stage like that.

1402
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:26,720
Hair out.

1403
01:46:27,178 --> 01:46:28,304
Madam, hurry!

1404
01:46:28,596 --> 01:46:30,306
Come on! Smile!

1405
01:46:31,391 --> 01:46:32,434
Smile!

1406
01:46:34,769 --> 01:46:36,980
Move fast. Hurry up.

1407
01:46:55,665 --> 01:46:58,460
Presenting Harleen Bedi.

1408
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:07,177
This is good.

1409
01:47:14,768 --> 01:47:17,145
Amma, you can watch the models
on TV.

1410
01:47:17,437 --> 01:47:19,439
Are the clothes well made, Mauji?

1411
01:47:22,776 --> 01:47:25,695
Go, get ready. Everyone, get ready.

1412
01:47:26,571 --> 01:47:27,572
Let's go.

1413
01:47:35,997 --> 01:47:38,208
Presenting Team
Needle & Thread.

1414
01:47:49,469 --> 01:47:51,638
- They're looking good.
- You're right.

1415
01:47:54,891 --> 01:47:57,102
The speed at which they walk
is just bad.

1416
01:48:26,006 --> 01:48:28,967
- Your phone is ringing.
- I don't have one.

1417
01:48:32,679 --> 01:48:34,097
Yes. Speak up.

1418
01:48:34,848 --> 01:48:36,266
Is it for a funeral?

1419
01:48:36,975 --> 01:48:39,269
250 rupees with dessert,
200 without.

1420
01:48:39,894 --> 01:48:43,148
- A catering order for a funeral.
- Keep walking.

1421
01:48:48,153 --> 01:48:49,571
You're looking good.

1422
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,198
Come, Beenu.

1423
01:49:11,468 --> 01:49:12,635
Look at the pants.

1424
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:14,888
- The cloths are very good.
- Yeah.

1425
01:49:39,913 --> 01:49:44,417
Carry those bundles of cloth
on your back

1426
01:49:45,710 --> 01:49:50,131
Make a quilt of life.

1427
01:49:51,466 --> 01:49:55,970
Carry those bundles of cloth
on your back

1428
01:49:57,138 --> 01:50:01,851
Make a quilt of life.

1429
01:50:03,728 --> 01:50:08,566
Walk along with us. Let us sew
on that button.

1430
01:50:09,526 --> 01:50:14,280
Put bad times behind you.

1431
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:19,953
Walk along with us. Let us sew
on that button.

1432
01:50:20,912 --> 01:50:25,625
Put bad times behind you.

1433
01:50:26,584 --> 01:50:30,630
Mend that torn bedsheet of fate
with a...

1434
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:32,966
...needle and thread

1435
01:50:34,175 --> 01:50:35,885
Needle & thread.

1436
01:50:37,137 --> 01:50:39,305
Needle & thread.

1437
01:50:43,727 --> 01:50:47,480
The needle is upright,
the thread is dancing.

1438
01:50:48,481 --> 01:50:50,025
Needle and thread.

1439
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,281
Needle and thread.

1440
01:51:00,076 --> 01:51:04,414
Carry those bundles of cloth
on your back

1441
01:51:05,790 --> 01:51:10,170
Make a quilt of life.

1442
01:51:11,504 --> 01:51:15,842
Carry those bundles of cloth
on your back

1443
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:21,598
Make a quilt of life.

1444
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:28,605
Walk along with us. Let us sew
on that button.

1445
01:51:29,564 --> 01:51:34,694
Put bad times behind you.

1446
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:39,616
Mend that torn bedsheet of fate
with a...

1447
01:51:40,033 --> 01:51:41,451
...needle & thread.

1448
01:51:45,747 --> 01:51:47,499
Needle & thread.

1449
01:51:53,922 --> 01:51:55,298
Thank you...

1450
01:51:56,966 --> 01:52:01,012
"The results of the Raymond's Fashion
Fund will be announced shortly.

1451
01:52:01,429 --> 01:52:03,181
"Till then enjoy the evening."

1452
01:52:06,851 --> 01:52:08,186
One minute.

1453
01:52:11,147 --> 01:52:12,273
Come back.

1454
01:52:25,495 --> 01:52:27,080
Should we step out?

1455
01:52:42,846 --> 01:52:44,681
It's suffocating inside.

1456
01:52:45,098 --> 01:52:47,308
There are so many ACs inside.

1457
01:52:53,398 --> 01:52:54,774
Hey, guys.

1458
01:52:56,401 --> 01:52:57,902
Hello!

1459
01:52:58,695 --> 01:53:01,281
Great show, guys!
We absolutely loved it.

1460
01:53:01,531 --> 01:53:03,366
Your designs are unique.

1461
01:53:04,117 --> 01:53:05,994
And outstanding presentation.

1462
01:53:06,244 --> 01:53:07,579
We were just discussing...

1463
01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:10,248
...had any other designer
presented those designs...

1464
01:53:10,498 --> 01:53:12,792
...they would have won.

1465
01:53:14,627 --> 01:53:16,254
But this is the real world.

1466
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:19,758
You don't have any experience
in this profession.

1467
01:53:21,509 --> 01:53:23,887
But this is your moment.
Enjoy it!

1468
01:53:24,429 --> 01:53:25,388
Come.

1469
01:53:30,393 --> 01:53:33,396
Mauji, it's almost time
for the last bus.

1470
01:53:33,813 --> 01:53:36,024
If we miss it,
we'll have to walk home.

1471
01:53:36,358 --> 01:53:37,484
Let's go.

1472
01:53:39,611 --> 01:53:42,447
Mauji, let's enjoy the party.

1473
01:53:42,781 --> 01:53:45,075
Tomorrow I'll be looking for
passengers all over again.

1474
01:53:45,658 --> 01:53:47,952
We won't get the chance
to come here.

1475
01:53:48,203 --> 01:53:50,205
Let's go back inside.

1476
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:55,794
Go ahead, we're going home.

1477
01:53:56,795 --> 01:53:58,463
OK. See you later.

1478
01:53:58,922 --> 01:53:59,923
Come on.

1479
01:54:00,799 --> 01:54:03,635
If they won't come with us,
what can we do?

1480
01:54:31,037 --> 01:54:32,706
This is a big day for me.

1481
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:38,837
I was someone no one cared about,
or even greeted properly.

1482
01:54:39,587 --> 01:54:42,340
But you have raised me
to the skies.

1483
01:54:43,675 --> 01:54:46,970
You've given me strength, son.

1484
01:54:47,887 --> 01:54:49,431
Now I will work.

1485
01:54:49,764 --> 01:54:52,350
You must carry on with
Needle & Thread.

1486
01:54:52,809 --> 01:54:55,937
Set up a roadside stall
or a shop.

1487
01:54:56,396 --> 01:54:58,648
I'll never let you starve.

1488
01:54:59,357 --> 01:55:02,068
If you make it big while I'm alive...

1489
01:55:02,861 --> 01:55:05,363
...you can employ me too, Mauji sir.

1490
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:20,378
Hello, Yogesh.

1491
01:55:23,548 --> 01:55:24,883
Battery's dead.

1492
01:55:25,633 --> 01:55:29,137
I'm sure they're both up to
some mischief. I'll go and check.

1493
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:39,647
They not only made us fall in love
with the clothes...

1494
01:55:40,023 --> 01:55:41,775
...but also with the models.

1495
01:55:42,150 --> 01:55:45,987
Volunteers, please call the winning team
Needle & Thread backstage.

1496
01:55:46,279 --> 01:55:50,492
Team Needle & Thread, wherever
you are, make your way backstage.

1497
01:55:50,867 --> 01:55:54,037
Team Needle & Thread,
they're calling you inside.

1498
01:55:54,454 --> 01:55:57,248
Excuse me, where is the
rest of the team?

1499
01:55:57,957 --> 01:55:59,459
Where are they?

1500
01:56:00,752 --> 01:56:02,671
You're being called inside.

1501
01:56:07,133 --> 01:56:08,468
Can you come inside quickly?

1502
01:56:20,188 --> 01:56:21,648
Listen!

1503
01:56:29,322 --> 01:56:31,408
Mamta, Amma, Bauji!

1504
01:56:31,825 --> 01:56:33,201
We've hit the jackpot.

1505
01:56:34,744 --> 01:56:37,706
I felt the ground beneath me
slip away.

1506
01:56:38,039 --> 01:56:39,457
But we were unstoppable.

1507
01:56:44,421 --> 01:56:45,714
We couldn't think straight...

1508
01:56:46,589 --> 01:56:48,842
...and we couldn't stop smiling.

1509
01:56:49,426 --> 01:56:52,804
Louder than the sound of fireworks
was the pounding of our hearts.

1510
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:55,724
The language of sorrow was
a language we knew...

1511
01:56:56,683 --> 01:57:00,854
...but we did not have the words
to express the joy of winning.

1512
01:57:01,896 --> 01:57:03,898
First time the Fashion Fund...

1513
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:08,028
...had to cast a re-vote because
the judges could not agree.

1514
01:57:08,361 --> 01:57:11,114
Over factory-made designs,
the judges have chosen...

1515
01:57:11,364 --> 01:57:14,701
...the Needle & Thread team
for their hard work and originality.

1516
01:57:17,287 --> 01:57:20,665
Do you still call dreamers "mad?"

1517
01:57:22,917 --> 01:57:25,754
Do you want to give a speech?
Thank anyone?

1518
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:34,929
What do I say?

1519
01:57:36,264 --> 01:57:37,599
It's all good!

1520
01:57:38,183 --> 01:57:41,936
Slam those doors in our faces.

1521
01:57:43,855 --> 01:57:46,608
See how wise we became.

1522
01:57:49,611 --> 01:57:53,948
Drench us in bitter poison.

1523
01:57:55,325 --> 01:57:58,286
See how honey-like we became.

1524
01:58:01,081 --> 01:58:05,210
Burdened with worry.

1525
01:58:06,795 --> 01:58:09,673
See how carefree we became.

1526
01:58:12,467 --> 01:58:17,097
We'll stitch the earth to the sky...

1527
01:58:18,223 --> 01:58:20,725
...if someone handed us a...

1528
01:58:22,936 --> 01:58:24,479
...needle and thread.

1529
01:58:31,319 --> 01:58:33,571
It was not just a victory
for our team...

1530
01:58:33,822 --> 01:58:35,657
...but a victory for all artisans.

1531
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:38,576
Not only did we get the money
to set up our business...

1532
01:58:38,993 --> 01:58:41,746
...but other strange things happened.

1533
01:58:42,247 --> 01:58:45,375
The Fund guys sold our clothes
all around the world.

1534
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:49,671
Our parents managed to save
a foreign tower from toppling over.

1535
01:58:50,338 --> 01:58:53,550
Top-rate companies called us
to hear our story.

1536
01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:57,429
While Mamta chose beauties
among beauties from every city.

1537
01:58:57,887 --> 01:59:01,474
We went back
to where we started.

1538
01:59:01,975 --> 01:59:07,397
We opened a tailoring school
to make others self-reliant like us.

1539
01:59:07,897 --> 01:59:11,776
And then we got an offer
we could not refuse.

1540
01:59:12,235 --> 01:59:16,906
We have an App now.
You can buy our garments online.

1541
01:59:17,824 --> 01:59:18,992
We're not alone.

1542
01:59:19,242 --> 01:59:21,911
Many talented people
all over India competing with us.

1543
01:59:22,287 --> 01:59:26,541
They're all "Mad in India."
And they're all good!
