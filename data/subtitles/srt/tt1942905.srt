1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,875
"Innocent eyes try to convey something."

2
00:00:49,957 --> 00:00:52,500
"Then gradually the heart sways."

3
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:55,417
"With open arms, but hesitant."

4
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,042
"Fly slowly, says the heart."

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,750
"Innocent eyes try to convey something."

6
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:03,457
"Then gradually the heart sways."

7
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:06,332
"With open arms, but hesitant."

8
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:09,082
"Fly slowly, says the heart."

9
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:14,582
"Just like you speak in dreams."

10
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:20,332
"Sway in the arms, dwell in the eyes."

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,917
"Just like you speak in dreams."

12
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:36,625
"Sway in the arms, dwell in the eyes."

13
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:42,207
"Something similar is happening."

14
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:47,832
"I am falling
for...something like love."

15
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,207
"Innocent eyes try to convey something."

16
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,875
"Then gradually the heart sways."

17
00:01:53,957 --> 00:01:56,750
"With open arms, but hesitant."

18
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:58,667
"Fly slowly, says the heart."

19
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:27,167
"I am not the fragrance,
nor the dewdrops."

20
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,625
"Yet I am present in the air."

21
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,500
"Tell me something."

22
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:37,292
"Express your feelings."

23
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:42,292
"I say to my loneliness."

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,250
"I am not the fragrance,
nor the dewdrops."

25
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:52,832
"Yet I am present in the air."

26
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,457
"Tell me something."

27
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,750
"Express your feelings."

28
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:04,542
"I say to my loneliness."

29
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:10,707
"Just like you speak in dreams."

30
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:16,125
"Sway in the arms, dwell in the eyes."

31
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:21,917
"Something similar is happening."

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,125
"I am falling
for...something like love."

33
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:42,792
Madhu, only our newspaper
is delivered late.

34
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,082
Did you hear?

35
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,625
Hello. Listen. Listen..

36
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,667
He doesn't listen..

37
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:53,625
Dear..

38
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:56,375
Ankita. This is the library book.
You have to take it along. - Yes, mom.

39
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,292
Amit, did you drink your milk?
- Yes.

40
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,332
Drink your milk.
- Wow, really.

41
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,625
Who are you talking to? Sumeet?

42
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:05,875
Are you lying?
- No, mom.

43
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,832
Did you write a letter to grandma?

44
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,125
Gangu bai isn't coming today. Eat.

45
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,292
Everyone has to do their own job.

46
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,832
Did you make your bed?

47
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,875
Did you make your bed? Do you remember?

48
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:17,125
Yes, I made my bed.

49
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,292
Mama, I am so sleepy.

50
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,958
I know, but what to do?

51
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,207
I don't want to go to school.
- What happened?

52
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,625
He's just like me, Madhu.
- Good morning, papa.

53
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,667
No need to remind him anything.

54
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,333
He remembers everything.
Isn't it, champ?

55
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,582
Maybe you don't know that
they have to go to school.

56
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,791
We are getting late.

57
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,833
The bus driver is honking away. Come on.

58
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,000
Come on, move, move.

59
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,958
Mom, my bag.

60
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,791
Lunch-box.
Lunch-box. Lunch-box.

61
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,083
Hello.
- Careful.

62
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,957
Bye, daddy.
- Bye.

63
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,541
Mama, bye.
- Bye. Take care, baby.

64
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,166
Oh, God. Getting late.

65
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,083
Hey, I found it.

66
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,750
Very good.

67
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,583
How can you forget your things?

68
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,125
Do you remember everything?

69
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,458
Thank you. Come on, move, move, move.

70
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,791
Bye, bye.

71
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,416
"Bye mummy."

72
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,875
"Bye mummy, bye mama."

73
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,875
He remembers everything except for me.

74
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,167
Okay, relax.

75
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,167
Just breathe.

76
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,166
See no evil. Think no evil.

77
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,457
Say no evil.

78
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,208
Yes, I am answering it, but where is it?

79
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,332
Hello.
- Happy birthday, darling.

80
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,000
Thank you.

81
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:57,791
What's wrong with your voice, dear?
- Nothing.

82
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,666
Is everything fine, dear?
- Perfect, mother.

83
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,125
Our trip to the US has
finally been confirmed.

84
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,333
Here, talk to your father.

85
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,458
Happy birthday, dear.

86
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,667
What is wrong?

87
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,375
Any problem?
- Nothing, papa, I am fine.

88
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,125
I am...I am so happy for you guys.

89
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,250
You guys just have a blast okay.

90
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,583
Have lots of fun.
- You too, dear.

91
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:31,708
And listen, this year is going
to very exciting and very happy.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,041
Did the priest say it?
- No, it's written in the paper.

93
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,291
Yeah, right.
- Read it yourself.

94
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,250
You get three newspapers.

95
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,791
Papa, I think Shravan
has sent a surprise.

96
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,541
I will call you later, bye.
- Bless you, dear.

97
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,000
Garbage.

98
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,250
Garbage.

99
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,583
No.

100
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,750
Was...that Raghav's call?
- Yes.

101
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,332
Three blank calls.

102
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,333
Is that your signal?

103
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:08,375
Yes. It was Raghav.
- Come on.

104
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,625
Good morning, boss.
- Shravan.

105
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,750
You were waiting for me.
- Thank you. That's it. We'll do it tomorrow.

106
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:19,750
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:25,125
I...I..
- Another problem at home?

108
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:29,125
No, no, no problem.

109
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:33,375
Actually my wife wanted
to go on a holiday.

110
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:35,582
So I was thinking I should
take a break as well.

111
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:40,250
So where is the problem?
- Not everything is a problem.

112
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:44,041
But I just don't understand where to go?

113
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,625
Leave that to her.

114
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,207
Let her choose.

115
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,417
Now that is a problem.

116
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,708
What about my choice? What about me?

117
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,250
And don't be silly, Shravan.

118
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,207
What are you talking about?
- You are being silly.

119
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,082
What do you mean?

120
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,292
That's what your wife will say, not me.

121
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,000
What do you mean?

122
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,625
Look, Mrs. Modi should feel that..

123
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,457
..she was taking the choices.

124
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,208
She is buying the tickets.

125
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:11,583
She is making the plans.

126
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:17,125
If you suggest to her then...do
you think she will like it?

127
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:18,582
No, she won't like it.

128
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,875
Then why play a match..

129
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:21,082
..where it's mandatory to lose.

130
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,333
Solution.

131
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,042
Tell me what the solution is.

132
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,625
The solution is simple.

133
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:28,500
Tell your wife that she
is free to go anywhere.

134
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,167
Mark my words.

135
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:33,041
She won't go anywhere.

136
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,875
Problem, bad idea.

137
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,500
Hello.

138
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:42,082
Shalini.
- So.

139
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,875
I was thinking that this
time we go to Mauritius..

140
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,957
..and then..
- Don't be silly.

141
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,125
It's no rocket science
to know women, sir.

142
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,916
Why does it take so
long to answer the phone?

143
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,792
Listen, Hitesh will come
home from the CA's office.

144
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,292
Give him the pink file.

145
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,167
Right.
- Which pink file?

146
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,750
The one I gave you to
keep near the computer.

147
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:22,166
That's orange.
- Whatever?

148
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,332
Listen, he will come after 11 o'clock.

149
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,667
You will be at home, won't you?
- You shouldn't even ask.

150
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,500
Where will I go?

151
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,457
When I call home from
the office, darling..

152
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,750
..please don't sound like this.

153
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,666
It's fine to sound like this
if you call from somewhere else?

154
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,667
What do you mean by "Somewhere else"?

155
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,707
Madhu, have you seen
your husband do anything..

156
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,916
..except for office
and office related work?

157
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Thankfully you said it yourself.

158
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,416
What else should I do?

159
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Stop working?
- Oh no.

160
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,583
Won't your office shut down?

161
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,750
Didn't your office stop functioning..

162
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:56,291
..when you are talking to your wife?

163
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,625
Go on, go on.

164
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:59,625
You have got a long
day, Mr. Shravan Saxena.

165
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:03,250
You don't have to tell me what
needs to be done, Mrs. Saxena.

166
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:05,832
I know what to do.
- Yes, right.

167
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,542
You know everything except for home.

168
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,875
You know this place
called home depends on me.

169
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:13,166
If I am not there a single day..
- Frankly I don't have time.

170
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,542
But let me tell you one thing.

171
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,083
Have you heard that story of the lizard?

172
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,417
Yes, she feels that she
is holding the ceiling..

173
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,667
What's it called? Oh yes,
the roof of the house.

174
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,207
If she moves, the entire
roof will come crashing down.

175
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,457
Do I look? Are you...are..

176
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,457
No, no, I am not saying anything.

177
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:35,042
Twisting the words doesn't
change the subject, okay.

178
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:37,207
Please, don't be so ordinary.

179
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,750
Get a life, I mean...stay happy.

180
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,832
And..

181
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,583
Yes, sir.
- The fax from Mittal and Mittal's..

182
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,125
..could you please send it in.

183
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:54,667
Yes, father.

184
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,500
What were you saying?

185
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,125
I was asking what time the party is.

186
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:02,957
When do we have to be there?
- I don't know.

187
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,832
There will be one if
it's supposed to be.

188
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,500
It's just my birthday,
what's the big deal.

189
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:11,791
29th February doesn't
come every year, okay.

190
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,375
Thanks for telling me, papa.

191
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:16,625
So will you just waste four years?
- Yes.

192
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:19,625
Will you stay upset like this?

193
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,042
I am like that.

194
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:24,833
And I am not sitting idle.

195
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:26,791
I have many things to do.

196
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,500
Cook food. Clean.

197
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,582
Curse the maid.

198
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:36,000
And then mother will call.

199
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,792
Look, so what if the
husband is busy and..

200
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,250
..the children don't have time.

201
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,750
You should get on with your life.

202
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,375
Maybe you can't do this anymore.

203
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,957
"I stepped on the clouds
and touched the sky."

204
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,958
"Today I have done."

205
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:42,500
"What I never did before."

206
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:46,250
"I don't have anymore desires."

207
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,792
"I have finally found peace."

208
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,917
"I have handed over
my life to my wishes."

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,667
"It's great, it's special.
Life is now like a dream."

210
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,458
Madam.

211
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,458
Tomorrow morning, 6 o'clock sharp.

212
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:27,375
Taxi.

213
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:47,500
Hey, come here.
- Coming, coming, coming.

214
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,292
"I have discovered paths."

215
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,542
"Which were never meant for me."

216
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,125
"Where the sun shone on dewdrops."

217
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:02,832
"Where everything seemed dreamy."

218
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,582
"I lost my heart."

219
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,917
"Like it never was mine."

220
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,625
"What I never imagined."

221
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:16,166
"Has finally happened to
me. It's a unique blunder."

222
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,542
"I have handed over."

223
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,917
"My life to my wishes."

224
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,750
"It's great, it's special.

225
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:29,832
"Life is now like a dream."

226
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,832
Come on.

227
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,332
Catch him.

228
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,792
Stay back.

229
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,208
Stop.

230
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,791
Where are you running to?

231
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,875
A fast local will pass from platform
number one. Please keep distance.

232
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,125
Catch him. Stop.

233
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,292
Catch him.

234
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,875
Where did he go?
- That way?

235
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,875
Sexy and cool.

236
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,875
No, that's fine. But..

237
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,417
But what? What's fine?

238
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,167
Understand girls, Monty. Okay.

239
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,125
You mean to say I don't
know women psychology.

240
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,792
Hello, hello. It's very important
to understand this consumer.

241
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,500
What do you say? -
Yes. - Yeah, I guess.

242
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,292
This is not the way she is

243
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,541
Now tell me what do girls like?

244
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,833
Girls like...chocolates.
- Right.

245
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,457
Diamonds.
- Yes.

246
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,207
Romance.
- Yes.

247
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,707
Yes, in fact girls prefer to be hugged..

248
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,207
..rather than have sex.

249
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,042
Who said so?

250
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,041
Hrithik we just love you.
- That's the thought.

251
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,041
I think we should go
for the 'so-sweet' types.

252
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,500
They last much longer.

253
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,333
Okay, what do girls don't like.

254
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,332
No dieting.
- No violence.

255
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,750
No maths. - No bad
breaths. - No smoking.

256
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,042
You be quiet, please.

257
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,041
Pink color.
- Yes.

258
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,333
Did anyone come from the
CA to collect the pink file?

259
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,500
Wrong number.

260
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,208
Bad joke, Mads.

261
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,750
Tell me quickly I have a meeting.

262
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,542
Do you talk to wrong numbers?

263
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,000
What's wrong with you?
- What's right with me?

264
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,625
You want to argue?
- Who is arguing?

265
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,083
I see, you are speaking
to a wrong number..

266
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,458
Maybe it's my first day
to talk to wrong numbers.

267
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:45,250
There's always a first
time...for everything.

268
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,958
Madhu..

269
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:55,291
Well, sir, Monty has given
these atrocious designs.

270
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,625
They are very tacky.

271
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,208
When you have to make an investment..

272
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,207
..like for buying a flat or bungalow..

273
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,750
..then the middle-class
housewife will never go alone.

274
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,166
Any guesses.

275
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,625
How much a middle-class
housewife spends on her own?

276
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,250
Monty, get me a proper figure. Okay.
- Yes.

277
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,250
Now tell me what will be
the maximum excitement..

278
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,167
..in a middle-class housewife's life?

279
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,167
Buying movie tickets.

280
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,000
Or flowers to decorate her house..

281
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,625
..or a small frame.

282
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,291
Excuse me.

283
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,250
Yes.
- Good morning, sir.

284
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,458
May I speak to Mr. Shravan Saxena?
- Speaking.

285
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,500
Good morning, sir, Ashmita from Town
bank. We need to verify your address.

286
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:42,958
Ashmita, can we talk
about this later, please.

287
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:46,875
There's been a purchase of 200,000
on your add-on credit card, sir.

288
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,125
Can you please confirm your address?

289
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:52,042
Sea-shells, 2400, Pali
mala, Bandra West, Mumbai..

290
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,458
Sir, shall we stop the payment?

291
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,082
No, no. Don't.
- Mind your business.

292
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,707
It must be my wife.

293
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,167
She must be settling medical bills..

294
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,791
..or buying online tickets...whatever.

295
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:07,375
No, sir, your wife is buying a car.

296
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,625
You have just received 100
more points on your card, sir.

297
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:19,917
Wow.

298
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,583
Hope you enjoy your new car, good day.

299
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,125
Thanks a lot, Ashmita. Have a nice day.

300
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,041
So where were we?

301
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,250
You were saying that
middle-class housewife..

302
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,375
..cannot spend so much.

303
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,167
But suddenly...why does..
- Suddenly?

304
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,791
..that same middle-class housewife..
- The same middle-class housewife.

305
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:51,375
..spend so much?
- Spend so much.

306
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:54,792
Write it down. Why are you looking
at Tarana? I am giving the dictation.

307
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:59,750
Hey, leave a message. -
No, she's lying. - Darling.

308
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,500
Okay, were busy. Please
call up.. She broke the cup.

309
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,833
Good morning, sir.

310
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,707
Get me buttermilk.
- Sorry, no buttermilk.

311
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,082
Make that fettuccine.

312
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:35,207
Fettuccine.
- That will be all, sir.

313
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,083
Coffee.
- Will the coffee be black, sir?

314
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,750
Latte?

315
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,250
Americano?

316
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,958
Cappuccino? Espresso?

317
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,417
You don't understand coffee?

318
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,166
Do you want me to explain it?

319
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,292
Will you run over us?

320
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,041
Good morning. Ma'am.

321
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:29,166
You would want non-smoking, right?

322
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:34,250
Did you ask or suggest it?
- No, ma'am, looking at you..

323
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,291
Looking at me what?
- I mean..

324
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,833
No, no, no go on, go on.

325
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,332
"Looking at me what."

326
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,666
No, I am sure you don't smoke..

327
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,916
..so I thought you would
want a non-smoking table.

328
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,666
You can guess just by looking..

329
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,416
..what one would like to
have and where they will sit.

330
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,416
No, no, we can make out.

331
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,416
Slightly. Just a little.

332
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:58,832
By looking.

333
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,541
Men can't see.

334
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,291
My husband can't even see
the socks lying before him.

335
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:06,457
He empties the entire
cupboard looking for one paper.

336
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,582
And then "Madhu, where
did you keep that CD".

337
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,167
By the way..

338
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,291
What do you feel looking at them?

339
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,541
So I was wearing boot cut pants.

340
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:20,208
By the way what do you
feel looking at him?

341
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,957
Has he lost his job or
thinking about his marriage?

342
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:28,625
Or he's an escaped convict?

343
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:31,791
Ask him.
- No, ma'am.

344
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,833
Ask him.
- No, ma'am.

345
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,333
Go on, check with him.
- Pinto.

346
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,582
Hello, sir.
- Hello, ma'am, how can I help you?

347
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,583
Some ice-tea to start with, please?

348
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,000
No, dessert to finish with.

349
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,750
Can I have the sizzling brownie, please?

350
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:44,667
Good choice.

351
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,541
That's the best we have.

352
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,375
Thanks.

353
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,500
Enjoy the day.

354
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,291
Please let me know if
you need anything else.

355
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,208
Sure.

356
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,250
Excuse me.
- Yes.

357
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,000
Can I have a lighter?
- Yes, sure.

358
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,542
I think I left it in the car.

359
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,625
Thank you.

360
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,375
Thank you.
- Welcome, ma'am.

361
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
Madhu.

362
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:28,625
Madhu.

363
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:30,875
I heard.

364
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,375
And your name?

365
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:46,291
Cigarette will be better.
- Its not good for health.

366
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,667
When 84% Indian women say
they have a big problem..

367
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,000
..it doesn't mean that they
are looking for solutions.

368
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,875
It means that they want a good listener.

369
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,542
They want someone to hear them,
hear what they have to say..

370
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,416
Sorry.

371
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,458
Don't worry; I will mail you
all the facts and figures.

372
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,332
Let's get going, brother.

373
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:10,916
Come on.

374
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,083
Sorry.

375
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:14,125
Mahender.

376
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:16,750
How many times have I told you..

377
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,917
..don't call me Mahender
publicly. Call me Monty.

378
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,708
Chill.

379
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:23,625
Despite all the surveys,
there is always a first time.

380
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,166
Keep this in mind.

381
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,333
Alright.

382
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,957
Monty.

383
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:35,875
Where do you work?
- Here and there.

384
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,583
Global firm.

385
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,750
You must have your own business, right?

386
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,500
That must be fun.

387
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,708
I don't like to discuss too much.

388
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,291
Insolent.

389
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,500
You should have told me this earlier.

390
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:54,167
About my work.

391
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,625
Trade secret.

392
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:05,000
Smart.
- Ladies change their mind in 10 seconds.

393
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,041
Insolent and smart.

394
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,041
How did this happen?

395
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,207
I was trailing goons.

396
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:19,958
Yeah, right.

397
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,625
Are you a policeman?

398
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,167
Something like that.
- Something.

399
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:31,375
Detective.

400
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,291
Yes.

401
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:38,791
Bill. Get the bill.

402
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:42,582
Are you following someone?
- Secret.

403
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:43,708
Oh.

404
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:44,916
What's the secret in that?

405
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Must be some poor helpless woman.

406
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,832
She must be tired of
her husband's escapades.

407
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,917
Now you have to keep a
watch on him day and night.

408
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,041
Isn't it?

409
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,541
This happens a lot on
television, isn't it?

410
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,333
Can I make a request?

411
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:04,833
No, forget it.

412
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,541
Can I say something?

413
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:15,875
I... Can I be a part of
your case, just for one day?

414
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,583
It's a very special
day for me, you know.

415
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Hello.

416
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,666
Yes.

417
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,875
Your picture's on the wireless.

418
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:50,708
Where else will the police
flash my picture, in your brains?

419
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:53,416
It's written, "Raghav Passport escapes".

420
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,791
"Raghav Passport escapes."

421
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,833
Good.

422
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,833
Did you book the flight?
- I didn't get an evening one.

423
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,875
If you can't get the evening
one then book one in the night.

424
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:02,583
Fine.

425
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:06,125
And book...book a ticket to Delhi.
- By plane?

426
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,500
No, by train.

427
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,416
August Kranti, 6 o'clock.
- Okay.

428
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,333
And book another ticket for Kolhapur.

429
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,250
How many tickets for Kolhapur?

430
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,000
What do you mean?
- I mean..

431
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,582
One ticket for each destination, Chandu.

432
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:22,541
I am alone so I will book
a single one, isn't it?

433
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,750
You called again.

434
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,375
Make it two tickets.
- For each one?

435
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,875
Yes, each one. Plane, train, everything.

436
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,041
Who is going along?
- It's a lady.

437
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:45,541
Lady.

438
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:46,583
Be careful.

439
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,375
Today's a special day, isn't it?

440
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,041
Sometimes Chandu gives the right idea.

441
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,250
Let's go.
- Special day.

442
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:02,625
Yes, I should get married this year.

443
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:04,875
Yes, baba.
- Whose car is it?

444
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,833
Who parked it here?

445
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:07,666
Him.

446
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,000
It's my car, wait just a minute.

447
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:14,082
Today's case?
- Yes, let's go.

448
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:21,500
The car.

449
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,125
Yes, guru. Okay.

450
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:25,750
The case is leaving.

451
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,541
Oh no.

452
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,250
It will.

453
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,542
Try again.

454
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,958
It will, it will. Come on.

455
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,125
Let's go.

456
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,666
Have you heard anything about it?

457
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,832
I will tell you at the right time.

458
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,625
By the way what do you feel?

459
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:08,250
He must have visited
the gym in the morning.

460
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:12,291
He is wearing a tight T-shirt.
To impress his girlfriend.

461
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,291
What do you feel?

462
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:17,207
Will there be any other
problem in my marriage?

463
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,833
But yellow?

464
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,125
Who wears yellow?

465
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,000
Did you talk to the bride's family?

466
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,250
But why is the car so old if he
wants to impress his girlfriend?

467
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,458
So that the wife doesn't doubt him.

468
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:37,125
You know I really think that..

469
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:49,457
There.

470
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,667
Anything else.

471
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,625
Send flowers for ma'am.
- Why flowers?

472
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,958
Today's her birthday, sir.

473
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,291
I thought that..

474
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,708
Will you please answer that?
- Sorry.

475
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:11,041
I will call you back.
I can't talk right now.

476
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,041
Today's 29th Feb and you
haven't sent anything yet.

477
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,041
Oh no, right away, sir.

478
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,958
I will just do it.
- Just a minute. What "Right away"?

479
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,875
What are you sending?
- The usual, red carnations.

480
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,541
Red? No, no.

481
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,541
Red is too much in the face.

482
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,458
But red means love, sir.

483
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,541
Very good.

484
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,625
I am impressed you are
attentive in the meetings.

485
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,833
So fine, red carnations.

486
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:36,250
Red carnations, two dozen.
- Four.

487
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,000
Four?
- Four as in four dozens.

488
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,458
Four dozens, right away sir.

489
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,333
Oh, God.

490
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,208
Can I be a good husband?

491
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,750
Is there even a good husband?

492
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:01,625
Hi, Mads. It's me.
- Yes, I heard.

493
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,250
Who is this speaking?

494
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:07,375
Hello. Will you please
give the phone to Madhu?

495
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,250
Give me the message I will inform her.

496
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,250
No, no, give her the phone..
- Call later.

497
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,166
No, I will hold on.

498
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,500
It's futile.- I want to wish my wife
happy birthday, damn it.

499
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,833
Just put her on the line.

500
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,000
She is busy at the moment.
- Hello.

501
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,208
Be a complete detective
if you want to be one.

502
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,916
Did you ask or suggest?

503
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,708
Hello, guru.

504
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,166
Who? Sorry, wrong number,

505
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:49,750
Stupid.

506
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:54,333
You are watching ahead, aren't you?

507
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,500
Please watch ahead.

508
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,083
I am driving.

509
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,791
You...you focus on the target.

510
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,458
You know focus is very
important in life..

511
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:07,541
..that's what... People say.

512
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,708
People also say 'Sada Suhagan Raho'..

513
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,833
..meaning die before the husband.

514
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,166
Sir, sir.

515
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,208
There was no one at home.

516
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:24,375
This came back.

517
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:25,916
The security didn't take it as well.

518
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,875
They didn't take it even
after they took your name.

519
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,583
Keep it inside.
- What happened, sir?

520
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:33,583
Nothing, and will you please answer your phone.
- Sorry.

521
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,416
And leave me alone for a while.
- Sorry, sir.

522
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,750
Hi, Mads.
- Hi, but this is not Mads.

523
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:40,583
Jai.

524
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,166
So sorry, I didn't store this number.

525
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:47,125
How is Madhu?
- She is fine.

526
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:51,041
Did you argue or not?
- How did you know?

527
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,541
Sorry, come again.

528
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,916
I didn't..
- You two fought, didn't you?

529
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,916
See, Shruti says that
you two can never fight.

530
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,791
We two are the only couple..

531
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,166
..that fight on special days.

532
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:02,958
That's why we had this bet.

533
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,625
No, we never fight.

534
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:05,833
Lucky you.

535
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:06,583
Look at us.

536
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:07,833
Four years now.

537
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,708
Whether its anniversary or birthday..

538
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:12,875
..we always end up fighting.
- Oh yeah.

539
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:20,125
No matter where he goes...we will follow him?
- Yes.

540
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:24,625
Did Madhu call?
- No, I didn't talk to her.

541
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,208
But I think Shruti called her.

542
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,541
But her call was on waiting.

543
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,250
Anywhere.

544
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,000
I mean, no matter where he goes..

545
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,833
..we will follow him there.

546
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,083
Yes.

547
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,041
No, I get it.

548
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,166
She must be talking to her mother.

549
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,500
Complaining about the husband.

550
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,958
Her favorite topic.

551
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:43,833
Catch you later.

552
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:44,875
Say hi to Shruti.

553
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,333
Okay, be happy
- Bye.

554
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,875
Anywhere means anywhere.

555
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,333
Seriously anywhere... I mean..

556
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,541
Yes.

557
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:56,375
Yes.

558
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:10,916
Let's go.

559
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,083
Pandey sir.

560
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:16,666
Hello.

561
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,625
Actually I am here to see you.

562
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,541
My marriage has been fixed.

563
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,458
You go on I will join you.

564
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,500
Come on, come on.

565
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:32,166
We will need the
orchestra the entire night.

566
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,375
We want to dance and
have fun the entire night.

567
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,291
Pandey sir.

568
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,541
Pandey sir, listen to me.

569
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,041
Pandey sir.

570
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:03,916
Hello.

571
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:08,208
I know that the police
don't know about this.

572
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,166
But you have to be a complete
detective if you want to be one.

573
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,583
You are leaving.

574
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:17,250
Whatever you think to do
in life do it perfectly.

575
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,000
That's what Shravan...doesn't say.

576
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,125
I say it.

577
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,208
There's no one at home.

578
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,375
The flowers came back.

579
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,166
Called me a wrong number.

580
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,291
Car purchase.

581
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,000
Someone says "Madam is busy".

582
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,958
What the hell is..

583
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:53,708
You okay, Shravan?
- Fantastic.

584
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:56,791
You don't look fantastic.

585
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,708
No, I am fantastic.

586
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,291
Are you...sure?

587
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:08,333
Yes, yes. It's just all work and
no play...makes Jack a dull boy.

588
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,791
Come on, we have to follow him.

589
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,333
By the way, why is
buying so much phenol?

590
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,708
Does he want to kill his
girlfriend too along with his wife?

591
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,333
Oh my, God.

592
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:50,833
Spinach.

593
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,041
Spinach.

594
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:54,833
For ten rupees.

595
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,375
Back at my place we get only
two bunches for 10 rupees.

596
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:59,833
Here they are selling four
bunches for such a low..

597
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:12,750
He's..

598
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,791
Why did he need that?

599
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,666
He will put the wife's dead body inside.

600
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,583
He will either burn it or dispose it.

601
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:27,041
Will your husband kill you and burn you or..
- Excuse me.

602
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:28,458
Enough.

603
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,083
I didn't hear anything
about him from you.

604
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,458
'Chandramukhi,
'Suryamukhi', 'Jwalamukhi'.

605
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,416
Do you know who they are?

606
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,875
Are they sisters?

607
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,333
It's the same girl
but different aspects.

608
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:47,041
I mean three versions.
- Split personality.

609
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:49,875
Wow!

610
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,625
And this man must have an
affair with one of them.

611
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,416
But how will we know
who he is meeting today?

612
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,541
There's place for three
cars. Three, three.

613
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,416
There's so much space
here. Do you want to fly?

614
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:11,833
Life...must be so different
for some people, isn't it?

615
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,916
Before marriage the
wife's 'Chandramukhi'.

616
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,458
Then after two years she's 'Suryamukhi'.

617
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,375
And after a long period..
- Jwalamukhi.

618
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,291
So who are we going to meet today?

619
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:38,750
Suryamukhi.
- And me?

620
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,500
Who do you feel I am?

621
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,000
What?

622
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:57,458
Nothing.

623
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:00,500
Raghav.

624
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:04,333
Raghav, the police is highly active.
- That's okay.

625
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:07,958
Hari was so careful, yet he was caught.
- That's okay.

626
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,791
I've heard that they first
pull out your nails in torture.

627
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:12,625
That's okay,

628
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,958
What okay? How can you be so relaxed?

629
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,625
Get out of the city before evening.

630
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,666
Meera.

631
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:21,875
Meera.

632
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,250
For you guys it's like...

633
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:32,250
Old car, old clothes, old phone.

634
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,625
I feel he has an old girlfriend too.

635
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,750
Come on.

636
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,583
Where are you going? Hello.

637
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:41,708
There she is? Meena, listen.
- Pancham, you here?

638
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,791
I have been searching
for you for so long.

639
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:50,125
Girlfriend.
- Why not his wife?

640
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:54,125
Come on, I mean she's so hot.

641
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,250
She can't be married.

642
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:10,000
"Sometimes I want to live."

643
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:15,500
"Sometimes I forget."

644
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:20,208
"Sometimes I wish a hundred times."

645
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:23,750
"For just a little love."

646
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:26,833
Come on.

647
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:28,666
No, you go ahead.

648
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,833
I don't believe in these things.

649
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:32,666
Then what do you believe in?

650
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:35,583
In taking risk.

651
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,333
Try it sometime.

652
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,041
Taking risk is very powerful.

653
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,791
Otherwise wherever you
stop in life that's the end.

654
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,375
"It's slightly changed."

655
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:55,291
"It's slightly glad."

656
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:58,458
"It's slightly restlessly."

657
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:03,375
"This heart."

658
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,333
"Even I have a wish."

659
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:12,583
"To belong to someone."

660
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,541
"To be angry."

661
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,541
"And argue naughtily."

662
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:21,666
"Just a little love."

663
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:37,250
"I just can't find it,
I searched everywhere."

664
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:41,166
"That face."

665
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,750
"The one who I think of everyday."

666
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:49,250
"In my heart."

667
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,375
"I just can't find it,
I searched everywhere."

668
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:58,750
"That face."

669
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,416
"The one who I think of everyday."

670
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,791
"In my heart."

671
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:12,041
"I search for her everyday."

672
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,125
"I forget about her everyday."

673
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:20,000
"Everyday I find her."

674
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,916
"In my thoughts."

675
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,583
"Just a little love."

676
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:03,875
"Wonder why its loss of words."

677
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:07,583
"My story."

678
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:12,083
"It's best that I narrate my thoughts."

679
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:16,833
"In my own way."

680
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:21,083
"Even I have a wish."

681
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:25,875
"To belong to someone."

682
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:30,958
"To be angry."

683
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:34,500
"And argue naughtily."

684
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:40,375
"Just a little love."

685
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:45,416
Did you wish mummy or did you forget?
- Did you forget?

686
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,666
By the way, if you haven't wished her..

687
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,375
..then you better have a plan.

688
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:53,458
Baby, papa always has a plan.

689
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:55,750
Papa, if you tell us your plan..

690
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,541
..then we will tell you about our plan.

691
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,708
Ankit.

692
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:02,250
I suggest that you
tell me your plan first.

693
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,583
Sister has asked me not to say it.

694
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,458
Then your sister must have a big plan.

695
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:12,333
Did you call mother or did she call you?

696
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,458
I spoke to her in the morning.

697
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,291
She was sounding happy.

698
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:18,500
Papa, why don't you
join Facebook or Twitter?

699
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,666
Very nice.
- Then there wouldn't have been a problem.

700
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:23,291
Okay, bye kids.
- Bye, papa.

701
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,541
If my husband would be ditching
me like this then I would..

702
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,291
Not straight, left.

703
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,333
I wonder what I would have done?

704
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:33,875
Why?

705
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,666
Hasn't anyone ever ditched you?

706
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,958
Amar ditches me everyday.
- Amar?

707
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:46,208
Our shopkeeper.

708
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,541
And when we bought the flat..

709
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,291
..that broker certainly up to no good.

710
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,666
And have you seen the bills
of the credit card companies?

711
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:54,833
It is cheating after all.

712
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,041
This is cheating.

713
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,208
Where did he go?

714
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:02,125
He's gone.

715
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:04,458
Hey, Ramesh, good to see you.

716
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,958
Tonight is rain dance, will you attend it?
- Yes, sir, I will.

717
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:08,291
You will also do rain dance.
- I will, sir.

718
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:10,583
There must be some kit in this bag.

719
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:14,375
Some mike, radar, gadget. Something.

720
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:18,000
Everyone will know that
we are following someone.

721
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:21,291
You..

722
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,291
Didn't anyone tell you?
- What?

723
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:30,000
You really don't know
how to talk to a lady.

724
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,916
Where is she? Lady?

725
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:35,791
Hello.

726
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,166
What am I?

727
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,333
You haven't learnt manners.

728
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,875
I didn't have a mother.
- Right.

729
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:46,166
Someone picked you
from the garbage dump..

730
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,750
No, I was lying in the garbage dump.

731
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:49,791
You know.

732
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,458
Then the crow started eating me.

733
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,041
They like child's meat, so..

734
00:49:57,458 --> 00:50:00,666
Didn't someone take
you to the hospital?

735
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,208
Someone must have
taken you to the clinic.

736
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,041
If this... Tetanus is important.

737
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,708
Vaccination is..
- No, it's not that.

738
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,041
Someone must have taken me.

739
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,041
Why are you sounding so stressed?

740
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:17,791
I don't know whether Madhu will
like this surprise party or not.

741
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,375
It's her birthday, she
will enjoy it. What else?

742
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:24,041
You know ideally what
Madhu will really prefer.

743
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:24,791
What?

744
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:29,625
Just the two of us...facing the ocean.

745
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:32,458
So his name is Samunder (ocean).

746
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,458
Interesting name.

747
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,416
Who are you talking about?

748
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,166
Madhu was with him in the car.

749
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,583
She was driving at full speed.

750
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,833
Ask her to drive the car slowly.

751
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,500
Or she might drown in the sea.

752
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:46,875
Single room.

753
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,250
Two.

754
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,333
How will we follow him
if we go in the room?

755
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,583
I mean...what if he runs away?

756
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:56,500
There are no rooms available today.

757
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:58,833
If you want I can give you next dates.

758
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:00,833
I think someone's with him.

759
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,458
You should have had a camera.

760
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:04,083
You don't have a camera.

761
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:05,875
Look properly.

762
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,583
Sir, all rooms are full today.

763
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,375
We cannot do anything.

764
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:10,833
Sir, sir..

765
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:12,875
There's one room available.

766
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,458
Get them checked in.

767
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:15,541
I will check, sir

768
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,333
Hello, sir.

769
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,291
Hello.

770
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:22,333
Mr..
- Joshi.

771
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,333
Sir, please sign here.

772
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,083
She loves me. She loves me not.

773
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,916
She loves me. She loves me not.

774
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:36,750
She loves me. She..

775
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,166
Stupid flower.

776
00:51:58,541 --> 00:51:59,791
Welcome, madam.

777
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:00,791
I am Manish. Room service.

778
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:40,875
This is the AC remote.

779
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,625
This is the television remote.

780
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,916
What else, madam?

781
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,333
There is no table here.
We need a writing table.

782
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:50,625
And get some papers.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

783
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,666
Is this necessary for the case?

784
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,833
If you come in the room
will it change anything?

785
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:14,375
Isn't the sofa too small for you?

786
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:18,666
Do you want to stay for long?

787
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:22,375
There's no place for two
people to sit together.

788
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,625
He has seen us.

789
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,833
No, it's a one way glass.

790
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,500
He can't see anything.

791
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:53,041
Room service.
- Yes.

792
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:54,708
How may we help you Mrs. Joshi?

793
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,333
Mrs. Saxena. What's wrong with you?

794
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,083
Room service.
- Yeah.

795
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:08,583
I would like..

796
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:09,750
Clear veg soup.
- Just one?

797
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:15,083
Make that two. And stewed
veggies. And I want carrot juice.

798
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,500
That's all.
- Will that be all?

799
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,041
Hello.

800
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:25,291
Hello. 'Biryani' (Pilaf),
two. Mutton and chicken.

801
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,416
Get kebabs and 'kofta
curry' (Meat balls).

802
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,000
And chicken fry, fish fry, prawn fry.

803
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:33,083
It's not fresh, sir.
- Yes. You don't have it fresh.

804
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,916
Forget it. And get a glass of buttermilk.
- No.

805
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:38,125
Two.
- Anything else, sir.

806
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,458
Two glasses of buttermilk.

807
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:47,541
As you can see we are
standing before Shamina temple.

808
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,500
Yes, the same place
where Raghav passport..

809
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:53,291
Yes. It must be him.

810
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,250
Where did you receive the report from?

811
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,291
Raghav?

812
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,625
He has been spotted somewhere.

813
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,000
But he isn't alone.

814
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,916
What are you doing?
- I..

815
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:17,375
Writing a report?
- Yes, reporting.

816
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20,750
He will spot us.

817
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:23,916
He doesn't know what we are doing.

818
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,250
Yes.

819
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:33,791
So where does Joshi belong to?

820
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:35,791
I am not Joshi.

821
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,083
What difference does it make
whether its Joshi or Doshi?

822
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:43,375
Not to you but it does to us.

823
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,625
Us?
- As in we women.

824
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:50,875
Whether its Mrs. Joshi or Mrs. Doshi..

825
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,666
..it does make a difference.

826
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,291
It's bound to be different.

827
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:57,416
If marriage is everything
then it does make a difference.

828
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,333
That's what happens maximum times.

829
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:01,666
Parties, picnic, movies.

830
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,250
Then one day...marriage.

831
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:07,500
That's not right.
Everything has changed now.

832
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:14,166
Come on. Ms. Universe. Ms.
Scientist....Ms. heroine.

833
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,916
When are you getting married?

834
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,458
When are you having children?

835
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,291
Whom does she meet? How does she walk?

836
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:22,500
Does she laugh too much?
Does she speak less?

837
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,375
All that matters, the
rest doesn't matter.

838
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,500
Just keep following the rules.

839
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,541
Where is it written that
it will all remain the same?

840
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,458
It does change.

841
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:34,750
Clothes, hairstyle, home address.

842
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,500
The ladies even change
their name after marriage.

843
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,375
Then..

844
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:44,916
I mean come to think of it..

845
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,166
..it does take a moment
to bring a change.

846
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:55,750
Revolver?
- Pistol.

847
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,416
It's the same thing. Whether
it's a revolver or a pistol..

848
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,625
..what difference does it make?

849
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:01,041
The design's different
but it does the same job.

850
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:03,375
Can I?

851
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,666
Your husband won't like it.

852
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,375
Shravan won't say anything.
- Nice name.

853
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,291
Yes, papa.
- Five minutes please.

854
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:20,041
Okay.

855
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:23,125
Hey. Shravan, all well?
- Yes, fantastic.

856
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:26,916
Are your parents coming to
the party in the evening?

857
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,500
No, dad, in fact they
are visiting my sister.

858
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:32,833
By the way is Madhu there?
Will you give the phone to her?

859
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:36,125
No, son, Madhu isn't here. She did call.

860
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,000
Did she say anything?
- No.

861
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:40,916
She didn't say anything, son.

862
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:44,416
Alright. No problem.

863
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,166
But don't tell Madhu there is a
party in the evening. It's a surprise.

864
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,000
Why will I tell her anything?

865
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,625
By the way, where is Madhu?

866
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,833
Oh yes, Shirin was
saying that he saw her.

867
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:57,291
Just check with him.
- There's nothing to check.

868
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:59,375
She always calls and she didn't today.

869
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,625
She is the one who calls me.

870
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:03,583
You never answer my calls.

871
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:06,333
You must have yelled at her.
- Me.

872
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,958
Come on, why would I yell at her?

873
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:10,875
All of you take her side.

874
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:13,291
Today is her birthday, do you know that?

875
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,166
I know today is her birthday.

876
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:29,750
This is not good for you.

877
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,333
I mean, it's not good for anyone.

878
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:44,250
Drink your soup.

879
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:46,708
Drink your carrot juice.

880
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,708
Eww, he would never do that.

881
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:53,458
What? I didn't hear you?

882
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:56,375
Nothing.

883
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,750
Your husband eats very
decently, isn't it?

884
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:04,708
He must be scared of you.

885
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:34,291
Do you want a toothpick?

886
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:36,458
If you want one then I will
order it from housekeeping..

887
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,250
You can see inside.
- Yes.

888
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:52,541
It's not one way glass?
- No.

889
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:55,333
No?

890
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:57,750
You said its one way glass.

891
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,750
Hello.

892
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:04,333
You can see from the other side.

893
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:06,916
You want to help, don't you?
- Yes.

894
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,833
Sure?
- Promise.

895
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,250
Then go and sit in the room.

896
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:21,166
I need a car.

897
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,416
You will get a car but you
will have to wait for it.

898
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,625
Raghav passport makes fake
passports for Tabir Potli gang.

899
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,833
Yadav gang's sharp-shooter
Kartik Dongre..

900
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:34,375
..was aided by Raghav Passport to
flee from India, its so believed.

901
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:36,000
Since then..
- And domestic airports.

902
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:38,333
We are waiting for inputs
from Railway terminals..

903
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:40,333
..to know if he's
escaping the city by train.

904
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:44,291
"It's the reason of many sorrows."

905
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:49,583
Yes.

906
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,291
Yes.

907
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,375
Did you find out anything?

908
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:09,291
The information is right
that's why I said sorry.

909
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:14,250
Look, if the information
turned out wrong..

910
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,083
..then I won't spare you.

911
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,583
The information is absolutely correct.

912
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:22,791
That...Riya...double-crossed you.

913
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,250
'Ma'am, we heard that you and Raghav
had an affair for three years."

914
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,583
'Did he promise to make you a star?;

915
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:48,416
'Your lover Raghav didn't keep
his promise so you took revenge.'

916
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,750
'Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, one last question.
Have you got a call from Hitchcock?'

917
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:08,333
You steal as well.
- I am learning.

918
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:09,875
Did you have to steal my phone?

919
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:13,500
Why isn't it working?

920
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,000
It fell in the water. Keep it to dry.

921
01:02:19,791 --> 01:02:22,166
I don't believe you guys.

922
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,000
You men do as you please.

923
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:29,791
How will I understand your
detection sitting here?

924
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:34,708
That man must have killed his
wife by now and buried her.

925
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:38,625
And I couldn't even stop him,

926
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:42,583
How will I know anything by
sitting in the room like this?

927
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:48,625
What is there to know?

928
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,416
Why do you want to know?

929
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,791
What's the point in knowing it?

930
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,791
You shouldn't consider
everything as a problem.

931
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:58,666
In life things happen,
they appear differently..

932
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,166
..but the truth is...it
boggles your mind.

933
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:03,958
Even He doesn't know everything.

934
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,250
Why are you telling me all this?

935
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,041
Because this is my bad luck!

936
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,666
Why did she deceive me?

937
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,958
Who? Who?

938
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,541
Who deceived whom?

939
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,541
A girl. My friend.

940
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,000
To a client. She deceived him.

941
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,083
The reason could be anything.

942
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,291
Maybe that girl loves
your client's best friend.

943
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:10,791
Or maybe she never considered
your client as her future.

944
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:14,375
Or maybe your client
became too possessive.

945
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:16,541
Or anything.

946
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:20,791
Or maybe that girl
fails to understand him.

947
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,583
Have you ever done
anything wrong in life?

948
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,291
Forget it.
- No, no, no.

949
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,375
I have copied.

950
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,666
In school, I had copied.

951
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,166
I had copied a handwriting,

952
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,958
Your life is very nice.

953
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:50,583
Just like they write on the board.

954
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:52,875
Beautiful, blissful, peaceful,

955
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:54,750
Your life is just like that.

956
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:58,416
In the morning, drink
tea. Read newspaper.

957
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,750
Go to parties in hi-fi
cars. - Just a minute.

958
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:03,000
Everything..
- Just a minute.

959
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,541
Just because I am not saying anything..

960
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:07,250
..doesn't mean that you
just keep blabbering.

961
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,541
Yes, I am an educated girl.

962
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:14,416
I live in Bandra.

963
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,291
The wife of an important man.

964
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,666
Mother of two children.

965
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:19,541
A daughter-in-law
of a big family.

966
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,708
What is Mrs. Saxena's problem?

967
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:26,458
That she doesn't have a problem.

968
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:30,333
Because she lives in Pali Hill.

969
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,291
She has a nice big home.

970
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,666
A nice life.

971
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,000
You know I could've been anything.

972
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,583
For my husband, I am a housekeeper.

973
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,333
A nanny for the children.
Doctor for the watchman.

974
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:53,250
A marriage counselor for my brother.

975
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:59,083
And on top of that I
have to look good at it.

976
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,666
Sleep with my eyes open. And
stay awake with my eyes closed.

977
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,208
I could have been anything.

978
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,416
I can be.

979
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,583
Its not that I..

980
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:34,541
"Sometimes I want to live."

981
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:40,000
"Sometimes I forget to."

982
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:47,958
"Sometimes I wish a hundred
times. For just a little love."

983
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,250
"Sometimes I want this."

984
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:57,625
"Sometimes I want that."

985
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:02,708
"Sometimes even I wait for
someone. For just a little love."

986
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:06,333
"It's slightly changed."

987
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,375
"It's slightly glad."

988
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:15,875
"It's slightly restlessly."

989
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:23,958
"This heart."

990
01:08:24,792 --> 01:08:27,833
"Even I have a wish."

991
01:08:29,457 --> 01:08:33,332
"To belong to someone."

992
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:38,332
"To be angry. And argue naughtily."

993
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:43,167
"Just a little love."

994
01:09:19,292 --> 01:09:23,125
Hello..
- That client has called thrice since morning.

995
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:25,000
Sit down. Sit down here.

996
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:26,957
Sit.
- Yes.

997
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:29,875
You know we are going to crack this.

998
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,542
This nail polish won't complete her.

999
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:37,375
I mean that woman is...
She is always complete.

1000
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,542
When she's pregnant.

1001
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:43,792
Or in her face mask.

1002
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:46,417
Or while yelling at the children.

1003
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:50,000
Or while getting pest control.

1004
01:09:52,957 --> 01:09:56,582
You see this nail
polish is like a friend.

1005
01:09:57,957 --> 01:09:59,957
And a friend is all we need.

1006
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,667
You know what I am saying.

1007
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:07,792
You made a blank call.
- No.

1008
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,667
The line was connected
but you didn't speak.

1009
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,292
It was a wrong number,

1010
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,000
How could it be a wrong number?

1011
01:10:14,332 --> 01:10:16,957
Don't you see the number
here? Can't you read?

1012
01:10:17,457 --> 01:10:19,082
Give me three rupees.

1013
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Get change.
- I don't have change.

1014
01:10:23,082 --> 01:10:25,457
Which room are you staying in?

1015
01:10:28,582 --> 01:10:32,875
That...that..
- That? There. Here.

1016
01:10:32,957 --> 01:10:34,666
A number will be better.

1017
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,457
The one close to the river.

1018
01:10:36,542 --> 01:10:38,792
I think...it must be the last room.

1019
01:10:41,082 --> 01:10:42,416
River?

1020
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,875
That suite. That room
which is like a suite.

1021
01:10:47,207 --> 01:10:49,250
A man comes there every week.

1022
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,375
With different women.

1023
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,082
He brought you for the first time.

1024
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,625
Very, very sweet.
Where did you come from?

1025
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:01,125
That..
- You took the long route.

1026
01:11:01,207 --> 01:11:03,125
He showed you the longer road.

1027
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:05,542
This would've been a shortcut.

1028
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,957
What are you blabbering?

1029
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:10,292
It's my car. I drove it.

1030
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:12,292
No one brought anyone here.

1031
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:15,125
Blabbering nonsense. I don't
know what's wrong with you.

1032
01:11:15,207 --> 01:11:17,250
Madam, suite... madam..

1033
01:11:17,332 --> 01:11:19,457
I will get you change..

1034
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:31,083
Excuse me.

1035
01:11:32,082 --> 01:11:34,000
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1036
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:38,457
Are you talking to me?
- How is your wife?

1037
01:11:38,957 --> 01:11:41,707
Wife. Look, please don't make fun of me.

1038
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:43,250
Where is your wife?

1039
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:46,625
Wife? Seems like it's the
stress of planet Saturn.

1040
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,707
I will have to wear my Neelam.

1041
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:51,250
Who is Neelam?
- Neelam.

1042
01:11:51,332 --> 01:11:53,791
Mother says it costs 5000 rupees Rati.
- There's a Rati as well.

1043
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,542
Rati, Neelam...who are they?

1044
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:58,207
Seems like this girl is
a problem from my past.

1045
01:11:58,292 --> 01:12:00,625
There is a detective after
you, do you know that?

1046
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:03,167
Detective.

1047
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:05,457
There's a problem in
your marriage, isn't it?

1048
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:07,750
So..
- No, no, no...I am not married yet..

1049
01:12:07,832 --> 01:12:09,375
..so how can there be a
problem with my marriage?

1050
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:12,082
Actually my problem is
that I can't get married.

1051
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:13,667
Yes.

1052
01:12:14,332 --> 01:12:16,916
Will you marry me, please?

1053
01:12:17,832 --> 01:12:20,832
No. No.

1054
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:26,542
No, no. What are you saying? No.

1055
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,792
Then what are you saying, ma'am?

1056
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,707
Actually I am doing my job here.

1057
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,000
I came here to organize a party.

1058
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:35,666
I was setting up my tent and you..

1059
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:38,332
It's not fair, it's not fair, ma'am.

1060
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,250
Happy birthday, darling. Happy birthday.

1061
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,832
You can't talk, right.

1062
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:44,000
No problem.

1063
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:47,083
But you can hear, can't you?

1064
01:13:48,082 --> 01:13:50,000
That how much I am missing you?

1065
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,792
You don't need to say it.

1066
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:57,042
I can understand.

1067
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,792
I will wait.

1068
01:14:00,582 --> 01:14:03,375
I just wanted to say that..

1069
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:06,082
..don't get angry over
the morning incident.

1070
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:09,707
I didn't know that
they are coming for you.

1071
01:14:10,332 --> 01:14:13,541
I was told that someone
died in the next room..

1072
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:17,832
..and they are only
coming for an inquiry.

1073
01:14:18,332 --> 01:14:20,541
Hello, are you there.

1074
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,958
Find out from the control
room where this call came from.

1075
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:40,125
How was the walk?

1076
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:44,292
I want to go.

1077
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:46,542
I want to go home.

1078
01:14:47,457 --> 01:14:50,250
Drink something. Tea, lime water.
- Why?

1079
01:14:50,957 --> 01:14:53,000
So that you can mix something
in it and render me unconscious.

1080
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:56,208
They have told me everything about you.

1081
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:01,250
Who you really are. Who you come with.

1082
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:03,500
And you come here often.

1083
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:09,500
I..I trusted you.

1084
01:15:11,957 --> 01:15:13,416
I should have understood before.

1085
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,957
You don't work at all.

1086
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:17,042
You are no detective.

1087
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,582
And this man isn't your case.

1088
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,542
Just like every weekend..

1089
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,667
..you must be thinking that
on this weekend this girl..

1090
01:15:23,332 --> 01:15:24,832
Do I really look like that to you?

1091
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,292
Do I look like that
kind of a person to you?

1092
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,000
I am not scared of you.

1093
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:44,417
I am going.

1094
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,417
I don't care what you do.
I don't care who you are.

1095
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,707
I just..

1096
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:55,667
Keep the gun down.
- Hands up.

1097
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,375
Keep the gun away.
- Hands up.

1098
01:16:09,707 --> 01:16:12,207
You can think anything you want.

1099
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:14,208
I don't want to say anything.

1100
01:16:56,082 --> 01:16:58,207
One of your friends had called.

1101
01:16:58,957 --> 01:17:00,332
She was saying something.

1102
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:03,125
But maybe there's a
lot she couldn't say.

1103
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:08,625
I shouldn't have heard it. But
I just think there's a problem.

1104
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:21,250
Ma'am, please. Ma'am. A
little to the left. Yes, ma'am.

1105
01:17:21,332 --> 01:17:25,207
Mumbai Police made a sensational
breakthrough in the Raghav Passport case.

1106
01:17:25,292 --> 01:17:27,542
Someone bearing a striking
resemblance to Raghav..

1107
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,457
..has been spotted at both Dahisar and Karvi
check-posts in a brand new red car..

1108
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:34,958
I want to share the bill.

1109
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:41,875
I will share the petrol expenses.

1110
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,500
You ordered for coffee.

1111
01:17:53,832 --> 01:18:00,875
They asked me... I signed by your name.

1112
01:18:00,957 --> 01:18:05,875
A person resembling Raghav has been
spotted with a women in a brand new red car.

1113
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:08,916
Its clear that Raghav's
outside the city..

1114
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,875
..planning his next
move with his friends.

1115
01:18:11,957 --> 01:18:16,291
What will be their plan?
Stay with us to know.

1116
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,542
'Are you a policeman? Detective?'

1117
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:32,542
'You can try if you want.'

1118
01:18:32,957 --> 01:18:36,291
'He doesn't know. What difference
does it make? Joshi or..'

1119
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:38,582
'It's a different design.
- I didn't know..'

1120
01:18:38,667 --> 01:18:41,375
'Raghav Passport, in the
Haji Ali area of Mumbai.'

1121
01:18:41,457 --> 01:18:44,375
'Its believed that Raghav Passport..'

1122
01:19:23,082 --> 01:19:24,625
What?

1123
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:27,875
I looked all over for you.

1124
01:19:30,207 --> 01:19:31,832
You are concerned about me.

1125
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,375
Yes, actually you should be.

1126
01:19:35,332 --> 01:19:37,250
After all, today I am your..

1127
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:39,166
What is it called? Shield.

1128
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:42,875
You passed your entire day so easily..

1129
01:19:42,957 --> 01:19:44,625
..using me as a shield, isn't it?

1130
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:51,917
Mummy, papa, always
say don't trust anyone.

1131
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,042
And never a stranger.

1132
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:56,875
Just leave.. But I don't understand.

1133
01:19:56,957 --> 01:19:58,832
It's not your problem, its mine.

1134
01:20:00,082 --> 01:20:03,791
I actually thought we
are investigating a case.

1135
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:08,292
I am such a fool.

1136
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:13,000
You didn't think about me even once.

1137
01:20:15,832 --> 01:20:18,000
You have been taking advantage
of me since we met in the morning.

1138
01:20:18,082 --> 01:20:21,250
You have been planning and
playing and then using me.

1139
01:20:21,707 --> 01:20:24,041
What...what are you made of?

1140
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,375
Crime is a habit.

1141
01:20:25,457 --> 01:20:28,041
Just like morning breakfast,
evening snacks afternoon tea.

1142
01:20:28,707 --> 01:20:30,666
Life is not as bad as you think it is.

1143
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,375
Life is not as bad as
you burden yourself.

1144
01:20:33,457 --> 01:20:36,582
Even you...even you can
make it better if you want.

1145
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:42,957
If you haven't noticed..

1146
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:45,625
..I can look after myself,
you think about yourself.

1147
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:49,667
Don't touch me. Are you
even listening to me?

1148
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:53,375
I heard.

1149
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,917
I heard what you said.

1150
01:20:57,292 --> 01:20:59,000
I even heard what you didn't say.

1151
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,582
There are many who speak..

1152
01:21:04,792 --> 01:21:06,333
..but few who understand.

1153
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:26,667
Madam. Where were you?

1154
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,250
I looked all over for you.

1155
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:30,042
I had to return your money.

1156
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:32,917
You gave me the wrong number.
- I didn't give you a room number.

1157
01:21:33,582 --> 01:21:36,666
Fine, its my mistake..
- Just a minute.

1158
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:38,958
You were talking about him, isn't it?

1159
01:21:40,082 --> 01:21:42,500
Who?
- About him.

1160
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:46,832
No, madam.
- You said all that about him, isn't it?

1161
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,417
Are you crazy?

1162
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,250
You told me the room
along the riverside..

1163
01:21:52,332 --> 01:21:55,500
..and only one guest comes
there with different girls.

1164
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:58,207
That's why I thought..
But that's not him,

1165
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:01,667
Now my shop's open, Your
money is right here, count it.

1166
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,332
These girls drive me crazy.

1167
01:22:08,707 --> 01:22:09,832
Sit.

1168
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:14,000
Sit.

1169
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,750
How many murders have you committed?

1170
01:22:29,832 --> 01:22:35,332
Two? Three? Five?
- More than that.

1171
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,332
Whether I commit one murder or ten.

1172
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:44,333
The sentence will be death.

1173
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:49,582
Stop, stop, stop. Reverse it.

1174
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:55,708
Can't you see such a big board?

1175
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:01,375
Take a left. We have found the place.

1176
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:14,707
Yes, dear.
- Sonia hit me.

1177
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:17,375
Are you okay? What did you do?

1178
01:23:17,457 --> 01:23:21,375
Smiled.
- And her?

1179
01:23:21,457 --> 01:23:23,291
What did she do? Did she hit you again?

1180
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,082
No, she started crying.

1181
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,875
That idea to laugh was great.

1182
01:23:26,957 --> 01:23:28,791
Who gave it?
- You forgot.

1183
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,375
You only said it.

1184
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,375
Can I go for football?
- Yes, sure.

1185
01:23:35,457 --> 01:23:39,000
But the shoes will get dirty.
- That's fine.

1186
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:43,167
I love you.
- Love you.

1187
01:24:23,417 --> 01:24:26,667
Yes.
- Finally. Finally I got through to you.

1188
01:24:27,082 --> 01:24:28,832
Yes.
- Madhu,..

1189
01:24:28,917 --> 01:24:31,958
..I couldn't get your phone all day.
- Really?

1190
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:35,957
What is wrong with you?

1191
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:39,417
Someone else answered
the phone in the morning.

1192
01:24:40,082 --> 01:24:43,000
I...I was wondering who is he?

1193
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,208
You okay?
- Yes.

1194
01:24:50,457 --> 01:24:53,041
I mean yes, what can happen to me.

1195
01:24:54,082 --> 01:24:57,666
Where are you?
- I just set out..

1196
01:24:58,832 --> 01:25:00,707
Why was your phone out of range?

1197
01:25:00,792 --> 01:25:02,500
It happens sometimes, Shravan.

1198
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:07,457
Madhu, didn't you feel like
calling up your husband today..

1199
01:25:07,542 --> 01:25:12,125
..and telling him your plan for the day.

1200
01:25:13,082 --> 01:25:14,875
No.
- What?

1201
01:25:14,957 --> 01:25:16,166
I don't.

1202
01:25:16,707 --> 01:25:19,207
I don't believe it.

1203
01:25:19,292 --> 01:25:21,417
My...my battery's really
low, can I call you back?

1204
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,250
Saving it for emergency. Bye.

1205
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,125
Do you plan to elope?

1206
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:44,458
Yes, it will be safer.

1207
01:25:47,832 --> 01:25:49,791
Are the police only in Mumbai?

1208
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:52,292
They are waiting for you in Mumbai.

1209
01:25:54,332 --> 01:25:56,750
I have to go. There's something.

1210
01:25:57,457 --> 01:25:58,457
But.

1211
01:26:00,582 --> 01:26:01,916
Stop the car.

1212
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:04,708
Stop the car.

1213
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:15,750
Will you shoot me if I keep driving?

1214
01:26:15,832 --> 01:26:18,541
I have a doubt.
- You shouldn't doubt friends.

1215
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:20,916
Friend?

1216
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:25,082
You know me only this much.
- No, this much.

1217
01:26:31,375 --> 01:26:33,000
Do you know who is a friend?

1218
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:37,167
One who knows everything
about you and still..

1219
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:41,917
I have to go.
- Where will you go?

1220
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:46,125
Someone's waiting.

1221
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:07,875
That..
- Yes, her name is Riya.

1222
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,667
Riya.

1223
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,707
The same...girl that..
- Yes.

1224
01:27:22,917 --> 01:27:24,583
She betrayed you.

1225
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,292
And you are that client?

1226
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,792
"Sometimes I want to live."

1227
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,792
"Sometimes I forget."

1228
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:20,332
Happy birthday.

1229
01:28:21,207 --> 01:28:25,500
"Sometimes I wish a hundred times."

1230
01:28:25,582 --> 01:28:27,125
"For just a little love."

1231
01:28:27,207 --> 01:28:28,582
Wish?

1232
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:32,917
"Sometimes I want this."

1233
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:38,125
"Sometimes I want that."

1234
01:28:38,957 --> 01:28:43,375
"Sometimes even I wait for someone."

1235
01:28:43,457 --> 01:28:48,416
For just a little love."

1236
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:23,333
"Was it a dream?"

1237
01:29:23,417 --> 01:29:26,083
"Or was it reality?"

1238
01:29:26,792 --> 01:29:31,250
"What I saw with open eyes."

1239
01:29:32,832 --> 01:29:34,582
Hi, mama.
- All okay, baby.

1240
01:29:34,667 --> 01:29:37,083
Mama, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1241
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:40,375
You know, mama, there is
a surprise party for you.

1242
01:29:40,457 --> 01:29:42,375
Don't tell papa I told you.

1243
01:29:42,457 --> 01:29:45,166
Our secret, mama.

1244
01:29:46,542 --> 01:29:49,875
What took you, mom?

1245
01:29:49,957 --> 01:29:52,750
"Was it a dream?"

1246
01:29:53,332 --> 01:29:57,791
"Or was it reality? What
I saw with open eyes."

1247
01:30:00,292 --> 01:30:03,500
"Was it good or was it bad?"

1248
01:30:03,582 --> 01:30:06,166
"I never thought about it."

1249
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:11,250
"My heart doesn't know what it was."

1250
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:17,457
"Was it good or was it bad?"

1251
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:21,208
"I never thought about it."

1252
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:25,292
"My heart doesn't know what it was."

1253
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:30,250
"Neither a companion."

1254
01:30:30,332 --> 01:30:33,416
"Nor my shadow. But yet.."

1255
01:30:34,042 --> 01:30:36,833
"..he treaded along.."

1256
01:30:36,917 --> 01:30:39,542
"..with me."

1257
01:30:40,457 --> 01:30:43,291
"Like a dream."

1258
01:30:43,917 --> 01:30:46,958
"Like an assurance."

1259
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:50,707
"Set along like the day.."

1260
01:30:50,792 --> 01:30:54,542
"..with me."

1261
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:03,916
Where are you?

1262
01:31:05,207 --> 01:31:07,291
I was right before you?

1263
01:31:09,207 --> 01:31:12,582
Where are you?
- Never mind.

1264
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:14,332
Hello.

1265
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:42,167
Did you have an argument?
- With mother? No.

1266
01:31:43,542 --> 01:31:47,667
Did you tell mother
that you are missing her?

1267
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:54,875
Tell her, then she
will beat you just once.

1268
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,707
Tomorrow we are meeting
at tuitions, right?

1269
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,958
You know I have kept my hair open.

1270
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:02,250
I will call you later, bye.

1271
01:32:02,332 --> 01:32:03,500
Mom.

1272
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,625
You look hot.
- You too, baby.

1273
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:13,500
Why did you disconnect the phone?

1274
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:19,500
Nothing to... We were
talking about the annual day.

1275
01:32:19,582 --> 01:32:23,166
And then..
- I didn't ask what you are talking about.

1276
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,000
Baby.

1277
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:32,625
I..

1278
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,332
Are you in love?

1279
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:37,750
Mom.

1280
01:32:42,042 --> 01:32:44,583
No need to disconnect the
phone next time when you see me.

1281
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:50,167
And it's fine if you want
to tell me his name later.

1282
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,457
Pappu.

1283
01:32:56,832 --> 01:33:03,207
Is he in school...or tuitions?
- Chill, mom, why do you get so serious?

1284
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,417
Okay.

1285
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:08,582
Mom.

1286
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:12,583
Actually thanks.

1287
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,000
Did you...

1288
01:33:21,207 --> 01:33:22,582
Ever..

1289
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:26,333
If you ever, Ankita..

1290
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:28,458
Ankita, have you.. Ankita..

1291
01:33:28,542 --> 01:33:29,917
I didn't do it, mom.

1292
01:33:30,332 --> 01:33:32,291
What?
- Sex.

1293
01:33:35,957 --> 01:33:37,375
Thank you.

1294
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:41,000
Thank God.

1295
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:44,082
Thank you. Thank you.

1296
01:33:45,207 --> 01:33:48,291
Mom, love isn't sex, isn't it?

1297
01:33:50,582 --> 01:33:53,332
And sex isn't love, isn't it?

1298
01:34:03,167 --> 01:34:05,833
You okay, mom.
- Yes, I am fine.

1299
01:34:08,417 --> 01:34:11,958
"Her words.."

1300
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:15,583
"..is what I cherished in my memories."

1301
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:20,500
"I don't know why."

1302
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:25,500
"Her memories are.."

1303
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:30,457
"..are now my companions."

1304
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:34,582
"I don't know why."

1305
01:34:34,667 --> 01:34:37,250
"She's neither a kin."

1306
01:34:38,042 --> 01:34:40,625
"Nor was she a dream."

1307
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,792
"Yet she treaded along..

1308
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:47,582
..with me.""

1309
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:51,125
"Like a dream."

1310
01:34:51,917 --> 01:34:55,125
"Like an assurance."

1311
01:34:55,582 --> 01:34:58,416
"Set along like the day.."

1312
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:02,417
"..with me."

1313
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:13,707
Mama, you saw your gifts?

1314
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,708
Hey.

1315
01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:19,917
Hi.
- Hey, Shravan.

1316
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,457
Here she comes.

1317
01:35:22,542 --> 01:35:24,000
'Happy birthday.'

1318
01:35:30,832 --> 01:35:32,082
Sir.

1319
01:35:32,917 --> 01:35:34,542
Yes.

1320
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:39,375
Ma'am. Ma'am.

1321
01:35:39,917 --> 01:35:41,167
We have to go to the police station.

1322
01:35:45,417 --> 01:35:48,750
"Whenever anyone asks me.."

1323
01:35:48,832 --> 01:35:52,582
"..what was the connection between us."

1324
01:35:53,457 --> 01:35:54,791
Who was the girl in the red car?

1325
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:57,082
"What do I say?"

1326
01:35:57,917 --> 01:36:01,042
Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1327
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:03,457
Happy birthday.

1328
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:11,167
Can I borrow my wife for a minute?

1329
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:16,292
You two are behaving like you
are meeting after a long time.

1330
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:22,542
It's something like that.
- By the way, do you spy on her?

1331
01:36:23,167 --> 01:36:24,375
That's a bad habit.

1332
01:36:24,457 --> 01:36:26,125
Come on, don't be silly.

1333
01:36:26,207 --> 01:36:28,207
Why were you saying
"Give the phone to Madhu".

1334
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:33,000
Because her phone was unreachable today.

1335
01:36:33,082 --> 01:36:35,291
Mayank and Seema were
saying the same thing.

1336
01:36:35,375 --> 01:36:36,832
He's calling up frequently.

1337
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:38,667
He's inquiring around.

1338
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:42,457
Madhu had an appointment
today...with the dentist.

1339
01:36:42,542 --> 01:36:45,667
Oh, dentist.
- No, piano teacher.

1340
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:49,333
Playing the piano. Play it.

1341
01:36:49,832 --> 01:36:52,457
I had a meeting with the architect.

1342
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:54,708
And Madhu is always
frustrated to meet him.

1343
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:58,542
I didn't want Madhu to be tense.

1344
01:37:00,917 --> 01:37:03,583
Aren't you ashamed? You're still lying.

1345
01:37:04,582 --> 01:37:11,500
"Like a journeyer. Like a companion."

1346
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:17,416
"Who treaded along with me."

1347
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:21,417
"Like a dream."

1348
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:25,667
"Like an assurance."

1349
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:31,250
"Set along like the day with me."

1350
01:37:31,332 --> 01:37:32,666
Nice perfume.

1351
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:39,917
Why did you want to meet me?

1352
01:37:40,207 --> 01:37:41,666
I am getting married.

1353
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:45,458
Congratulations.
- You too.

1354
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:49,125
What happened this morning is history.

1355
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,542
And I was never good at history.

1356
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:55,583
No, it's not a joke.

1357
01:37:55,917 --> 01:37:58,458
One more thing, Riya.
- What?

1358
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,707
I want to thank you.

1359
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:04,042
Thank you? For what?

1360
01:38:04,582 --> 01:38:07,166
I will tell that only to our children.

1361
01:38:07,832 --> 01:38:09,582
You will feel jealous right now.

1362
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:13,542
Do you know what you are saying?

1363
01:38:14,832 --> 01:38:15,875
I do.

1364
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:19,875
We will drink tea in the morning, Riya.

1365
01:38:20,542 --> 01:38:22,083
You will make it.

1366
01:38:22,792 --> 01:38:24,750
Good tea, special.

1367
01:38:28,167 --> 01:38:31,250
That white shirt, silk one suits you.

1368
01:38:31,332 --> 01:38:32,582
You wear that.

1369
01:38:32,667 --> 01:38:37,042
Or salwar kameez.. That will do as well.

1370
01:38:38,167 --> 01:38:43,000
You can say, "Four spoons of
sugar is too much, bad for health".

1371
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:46,000
I will reduce it.
- You are shocked.

1372
01:38:46,082 --> 01:38:48,082
We will get a doctor for you.

1373
01:38:48,457 --> 01:38:51,375
I am getting late and I
have a flight to catch.

1374
01:39:07,582 --> 01:39:08,832
Have you seen yourself?

1375
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:14,167
I am looking hot.

1376
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:22,125
This... I feel you should
have worn the other one.

1377
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,832
That diamond shaped one.

1378
01:39:25,917 --> 01:39:27,542
I am not asking you.

1379
01:39:29,457 --> 01:39:30,957
It feels like..

1380
01:39:32,707 --> 01:39:36,707
..I am meeting this
girl for the first time.

1381
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:41,167
Today or first time after college.

1382
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:47,500
Yes, right.

1383
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:53,457
You know...their guess work...

1384
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,332
..is true.

1385
01:39:57,667 --> 01:40:02,542
I mean I...was...worried.

1386
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:05,167
That where are you.

1387
01:40:06,917 --> 01:40:08,208
Etcetera.

1388
01:40:10,207 --> 01:40:13,832
Will it lower your etcetera
feelings if I tell you?

1389
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,332
Don't tell me.

1390
01:40:19,917 --> 01:40:22,958
You should have your own secrets.

1391
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:26,667
It makes you more exciting.

1392
01:40:40,082 --> 01:40:42,000
If it still matters.

1393
01:40:42,375 --> 01:40:43,707
Happy birthday.

1394
01:41:00,417 --> 01:41:03,208
Madhu. Madhu, come here. See this.

1395
01:41:04,042 --> 01:41:06,833
Raghav's surrender has
surprised the Mumbai police.

1396
01:41:06,917 --> 01:41:09,542
They hope that there is
no new strategy to this.

1397
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:15,750
And while surrendering,
Raghav has said..

1398
01:41:15,957 --> 01:41:18,416
..in his statement that
he hasn't murdered anyone.

1399
01:41:19,042 --> 01:41:21,875
And whatever the court's
decision will be..

1400
01:41:21,957 --> 01:41:23,541
..after his statement but
he would like to live..

1401
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:25,457
..like a normal man after today.

1402
01:41:25,542 --> 01:41:28,292
If Jai had listened to me
it would've benefited him.

1403
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:30,500
What do you say?

1404
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:32,292
Jai?

1405
01:41:33,917 --> 01:41:35,917
Look, the shares of
Nascor chemical shares..

1406
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,625
..are up 495 points.

1407
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,875
Have gone up 40 points.

1408
01:41:41,457 --> 01:41:42,832
But he doesn't listen to me.

1409
01:41:44,207 --> 01:41:46,832
In fact it will go
higher than 40 points.

1410
01:41:47,792 --> 01:41:52,458
Very few people believe in taking risks.
- Sorry.

1411
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:53,958
I want to see.

1412
01:41:54,042 --> 01:41:56,958
And not on the basis
of guns and explosives.

1413
01:41:57,457 --> 01:42:00,125
He is so cute.

1414
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:03,667
Who, Jai uncle?
- Who is talking about him?

1415
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:04,957
Then who?

1416
01:42:38,417 --> 01:42:41,292
"Innocent eyes try to convey something."

1417
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,917
"Then gradually the heart sways."

1418
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,375
"With open arms."

1419
01:42:45,457 --> 01:42:46,625
"Yet hesitant."

1420
01:42:46,707 --> 01:42:49,250
"Fly slowly, says the heart."

1421
01:42:49,332 --> 01:42:52,125
"Innocent eyes try to convey something."

1422
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:54,666
"Then gradually the heart sways."

1423
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:56,167
"With open arms."

1424
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:57,417
"Yet hesitant."

1425
01:42:57,500 --> 01:43:00,542
"Fly slowly, says the heart."

1426
01:43:00,917 --> 01:43:05,917
"Just like you speak in dreams."

1427
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:11,750
"Sway in the arms, dwell in the eyes."

1428
01:43:17,332 --> 01:43:22,457
"Just like you speak in dreams."

1429
01:43:22,917 --> 01:43:27,792
"Sway in the arms, dwell in the eyes."

1430
01:43:28,417 --> 01:43:33,625
"Something similar is happening."

1431
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:39,207
"I am falling
for...something like love."

1432
01:43:39,707 --> 01:43:42,582
"Innocent eyes try to convey something."

1433
01:43:42,667 --> 01:43:45,250
"Then gradually the heart sways."

1434
01:43:45,332 --> 01:43:46,625
"With open arms."

1435
01:43:46,707 --> 01:43:47,957
"Yet hesitant."

1436
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:50,917
"Fly slowly, says the heart."

1437
01:44:13,207 --> 01:44:18,582
"I am not the fragrance,
nor the dewdrops."

1438
01:44:18,667 --> 01:44:23,167
"Yet I am present in the air."

1439
01:44:24,082 --> 01:44:26,791
"Tell me something."

1440
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:29,582
"Express your feelings."

1441
01:44:29,667 --> 01:44:33,792
"I say to my loneliness."

1442
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:40,042
"I am not the fragrance,
nor the dewdrops."

1443
01:44:40,542 --> 01:44:45,167
"Yet I am present in the air."

1444
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:48,667
"Tell me something."

1445
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:51,332
"Express your feelings."

1446
01:44:51,417 --> 01:44:55,833
"I say to my loneliness."

1447
01:44:56,917 --> 01:45:01,917
"Just like twisting words."

1448
01:45:02,457 --> 01:45:07,541
"Breaking habits, interpreting dreams."

1449
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,750
"Something similar is happening."

1450
01:45:13,207 --> 01:45:18,166
"I am falling
for...something like love."
