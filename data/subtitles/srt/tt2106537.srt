1
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:40,513
Ten minutes earlier...

2
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:50,490
'Dry day.
Liquor won't be sold today.'

3
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,459
l'm asking politely...

4
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:58,503
Just hand over two
bottles of Gulabbo.

5
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,308
Today's a dry day!

6
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:05,473
lt's Friday.

7
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,745
Who are you?

8
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:12,742
Saturday...

9
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:16,750
l'm Saturday... you jerk,
open the store!

10
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:20,484
And you think l'm Wednesday?

11
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:21,927
Now, get lost!

12
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:29,470
Hello...

13
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:34,673
There's no reason to get angry,
brother.

14
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:37,672
l asked... you refused...

15
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:39,270
That's it!

16
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,442
You are right...

17
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,615
100%%%

18
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:49,913
ln fact, today is a dry day.

19
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,057
Here, take this thousand rupees...

20
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,668
give us one bottle, if not two.

21
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,865
As you wish!

22
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:08,275
Get lost, you drunk morons!

23
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:10,870
Howzzat!

24
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,877
Last time both of you
brawled with the truckers...

25
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:16,439
you destroyed bottles
worth a 1000 bucks!

26
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,278
This old owner had
his license revoked.

27
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,323
l'm the new owner...

28
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:29,555
forget the booze,
l won't even sell my piss to you!

29
00:06:56,758 --> 00:07:02,390
MATRU Kl BlJLEE KA MANDOLA

30
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,016
Matru...

31
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:00,452
Why did your dad
take a loan from me?

32
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,820
Not my dad, my grandpa did.

33
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:04,256
For my education.

34
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,259
- How much?
- 150,000.

35
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,821
That would have fetched me
36,500 bottles of Gulabbo!

36
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,836
lf you wanted to
become a servant...

37
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,769
why did you study law?

38
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,940
Just to blow up my money?!

39
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,967
To punish you.

40
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,812
Why? Am l a thief?

41
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,849
No...

42
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,383
You're the Prince of thieves!

43
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,420
Fellow farmers of Mandola village!

44
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:41,426
l know the injustice you suffer.

45
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:44,994
l share your pain.

46
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:48,764
Land owners are being forced to
turn into labourers...

47
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:53,806
so that a car factory
can replace your farm land.

48
00:08:54,843 --> 00:08:57,311
Ever since the factory
was proposed...

49
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:00,438
there are no seeds or
fertilizers in the market.

50
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:08,754
And the electricity supply
has been reduced to 1 hour.

51
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:14,887
lnstead of wheat, we have
bank loans swaying in our fields.

52
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,699
They want us to get
buried under our debts...

53
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:26,303
and we have no option
but to sell our land.

54
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:30,572
So they can declare it
a Special Economic Zone.

55
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:36,750
We won't let our farm land
be turned into concrete jungles!

56
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:46,686
One man alone is
the root of this exploitation.

57
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:47,853
One man...

58
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:50,524
Who is that filthy dog?

59
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:53,800
Who is that dog?
Bloody buffoon!

60
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,800
Speak up!

61
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,440
Fear not,
l'll fix that son of a gun!

62
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:05,910
Who is it?

63
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:08,980
After whom this village is named...

64
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:10,878
Mandola.

65
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,755
Me?!

66
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:20,290
We have to claim our right...

67
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:24,855
and if we don't get it,
we have to fight for it!

68
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:27,663
Enemy of the rich.

69
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,465
Friend of the farmers.

70
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,034
Mao Tse Tung.

71
00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:34,498
Mao Tse Tung?

72
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,935
From China to Haryana?

73
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:44,346
Such injustice to my brothers
and l'm responsible?

74
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:47,783
l'd rather die
than do such evil!

75
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:51,656
Granted l'm a scoundrel...

76
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,419
Mandola... idiot... scoundrel.

77
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:58,728
But why are you behaving like
Gandhi's three monkeys?

78
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:01,026
Why haven't you fought yet?

79
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:02,433
What can we do??

80
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:04,368
Sue me...

81
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,266
file a complaint...

82
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,968
report to the press...

83
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:12,311
The police is yours,
the law is yours...

84
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,848
and the government belongs
to your mother!

85
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:20,779
Then why don't you organize
a procession against me?

86
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:27,620
Revolution!

87
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:30,323
Lower your bucket

88
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,525
ln the well

89
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,427
Claim the water of every well

90
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:37,733
Lower your bucket in the well

91
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,535
Claim the water of every well

92
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,702
You're the owner
if you own the soil

93
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:52,851
He who tills must own the soil

94
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:02,655
No big shot can force his wishes

95
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:06,355
lf the sugarcane's mine
so are its pieces

96
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,268
Out plunderer, Out! Out!

97
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,311
We'll not give the seeds

98
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,916
Yesterday's debt

99
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,984
Won't be paid today

100
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:13,761
Your arms and sticks
will no longer work

101
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:18,795
Your bullying and hectoring
will no longer work

102
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:20,841
Let hammers bang

103
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:24,002
Let sickles clang

104
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:26,940
Out plunderer, Out! Out!

105
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:30,716
Keep going!

106
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,819
Now l'll enter the mansion
through the back door...

107
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,688
come out as
Mr. Harphool Singh Mandola...

108
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:41,024
and approve all your demands.

109
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,421
Okay?

110
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:43,657
Okay.

111
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:45,365
Hold on, Harry...

112
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,400
What happened?

113
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,959
Smart boy!

114
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,304
Better?

115
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,498
Much better.

116
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,361
Come closer!

117
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:21,691
What the hell is happening?

118
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,394
Sir, farmers... from the village.

119
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:27,961
What do they want?

120
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,295
Their land.

121
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,908
Your tyranny

122
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:40,539
We'll no longer heed

123
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,840
Our protest

124
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,578
We'll no longer cede

125
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:48,447
Your umbrella we'll hold no longer

126
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:51,013
Now your feet the sun will smolder

127
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:58,387
He who digs

128
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:01,592
Must own the well

129
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,298
Out plunderer, Out! Out!

130
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:28,885
Run for your lives!

131
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:53,777
Take that!

132
00:16:57,358 --> 00:17:00,919
Hukum Singh Matru.
The gambler of gamblers!

133
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,885
Okay boys...

134
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:04,593
see you.

135
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:05,825
Hold on...

136
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,794
one more hand.

137
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,665
No way, the monster will
awaken any moment.

138
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,705
So what?

139
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,731
Now, his dream factory has been
flushed down the pot!

140
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:21,547
Precisely why he'll wake up
and hunt for me.

141
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,841
Look at the time...

142
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,256
l'd say times are bad.

143
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:32,690
Run... there is a storm coming.

144
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,030
Good morning, Mr. Mandola.

145
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:52,979
So, have l hired you to gamble?

146
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:55,612
No, Mr. Mandola.

147
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:57,711
Then why?

148
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,417
To drive your car.

149
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:07,452
There are 50 drivers in the mansion.

150
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:10,830
Why did l hire you?

151
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,359
To keep you from having
more than four drinks!

152
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:17,703
And?

153
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:20,466
To control you
when you're drunk.

154
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:22,732
How many drinks
did l have last night?

155
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,547
20 last night and
20 night before.

156
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,643
The other 2?

157
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:34,346
You had those in your sleep.

158
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:38,918
l led a procession against myself?

159
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:41,922
Yes, Mr. Mandola.

160
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,925
Did you stop me?

161
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,372
l did try but you said...

162
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:02,814
'lt's my factory,
it's my land...

163
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,544
so why do you care?'

164
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:07,720
Then l asked you, what about the
6 billion rupee housing project...

165
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:11,220
but you replied,
'To hell with the project!'

166
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:12,758
Then l reminded you...

167
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:15,728
...about your daughter's marriage
to the Minister's son...

168
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:16,991
you replied...

169
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:20,563
'that loser is not worth
marrying a village pooch'.

170
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:22,634
And then l said...

171
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,541
You've said enough.

172
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:30,401
Pay attention...

173
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,376
l've quit drinking from today.

174
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:35,246
Why?

175
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:39,684
So that you and the villagers
can't take undue advantage of me.

176
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:44,618
Get the car out.

177
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,354
The Mercedes or the Bentley?

178
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,695
Why you...!

179
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:51,991
Limousine.

180
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,436
There's no way you can quit drinking.
You bloody buffoon!

181
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,409
You're in for a long suffering...

182
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:14,386
as long as a limousine!

183
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:31,796
Hello Harry...

184
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:33,567
Not the answering machine again!

185
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:34,767
Where are you?

186
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,503
Madam
Minister has reached.

187
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:38,441
lnspector, hurry up.

188
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:39,501
The chopper is here.

189
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,411
Just a minute, brother.

190
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,948
This is the problem
with whiskey drinkers...

191
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:52,855
their breath stinks like
a goat's behind the next day.

192
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:56,321
You walk straight.

193
00:20:56,397 --> 00:20:57,523
l'm walking straight!

194
00:20:57,598 --> 00:20:58,997
Stop acting like kids!

195
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:00,525
Here...

196
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:02,627
have some mint.

197
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:08,373
And drink only
as much as you can handle.

198
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,009
Whiskey might give
you a hangover...

199
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:17,341
but you don't throw up
like these wine drinkers!

200
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:47,008
What's wrong with them?

201
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,346
Food poisoning, madam.

202
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,076
What?

203
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,842
Remove the handkerchief.

204
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:57,549
Food poisoning.

205
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,658
What?

206
00:21:58,826 --> 00:22:00,555
Look at me when you talk.

207
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:26,382
How can you do this
to yourself, Mr. Mandola?

208
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,318
Three years of hard work
down the drain.

209
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:32,849
All the farmers had agreed.

210
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:35,826
Clearance by the environment ministry,
approval by the standing committee...

211
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,693
everything was in place.

212
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,434
l... l don't understand this.

213
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:43,961
The farmers would have
signed the agreement...

214
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:45,767
our children
would have gotten married...

215
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,933
and we would have begun work
on your factory.

216
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,778
And who is this Mao Tse Tung?

217
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,973
Whoever he is,
we'll arrest him soon.

218
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,647
The police is investigating, madam.

219
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:03,446
Your police is throwing up on the
streets, drunk out of their wits!

220
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:08,790
The last thing l want in my state
is the Naxalite movement.

221
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:09,829
Got it?

222
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,736
What is this?

223
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,405
Wheat fields, madam.

224
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:25,543
And you think l can see
fields of eggs? Blind am l?

225
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,539
Your report states that...

226
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,875
these fields are barren.

227
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,583
They were barren
for the past three years, madam.

228
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:35,315
But, this year...

229
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:36,780
What happened this year?

230
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:38,415
lt rained...

231
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:40,425
on time.

232
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,361
Peace.

233
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:50,061
Declaring this land as Special
Economic Zone is political suicide.

234
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:51,699
Mom...

235
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,774
why don't we destroy
these crops?

236
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,604
There are many ways of doing that.

237
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:58,804
Right?

238
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,011
So sweet!

239
00:24:09,256 --> 00:24:10,450
What?

240
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,496
lt happened right under your nose
and you didn't get a whiff?

241
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:25,731
Right under the nose are the lips!

242
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:30,410
Your lips are looking hot, babe.

243
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:36,012
lf not for the factory, quit
drinking for your daughter's sake.

244
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:39,347
l've quit... from today.

245
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:45,414
Really!

246
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,889
Swear on my life...

247
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:56,736
That l can't do.

248
00:24:57,738 --> 00:24:59,968
But you'd gladly have me?

249
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:02,806
You're delicious.

250
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,743
A small little gift for you.

251
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:21,857
lf a rat doesn't get caught
in the trap the first time...

252
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:26,432
you have to tempt it with
twice as much cheese.

253
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,495
We have to double
the farmer's compensation.

254
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:33,534
That means...

255
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:36,775
you'll lose 150 million rupees.

256
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,474
Sorry, darling.

257
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,002
ls she Mandola's daughter?

258
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,431
Yeah...

259
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:40,933
Bijlee Mandola.

260
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,833
Fix her onto your well...

261
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:46,974
and your irrigation problems
will be solved, for free.

262
00:27:16,877 --> 00:27:17,866
Guruji...

263
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:19,679
greetings.

264
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,380
How many times have l told you...

265
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,414
not to go swimming in
just vest and shorts.

266
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:32,652
Well then, what should l take off?

267
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:35,623
The-shorts or the vest?

268
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:39,490
Bloody

269
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:40,430
male

270
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:41,932
chauvinist

271
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,736
piggy...

272
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,803
The whole village will be
fantasizing about you all night!

273
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,810
You can look... but with love!

274
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,221
This model is named after me...

275
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:06,421
everything should be perfect.

276
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:09,424
Or l'll stall the launch.

277
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,989
Did you check the gearbox?

278
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:13,264
Yes, madam.

279
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,300
And the logo?

280
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,362
l'll get it.

281
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,777
Let's go!

282
00:28:25,512 --> 00:28:26,536
Where?

283
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:27,944
You're wanted at the mansion.

284
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,541
Why?

285
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:32,344
Your deal's being worked out.

286
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:34,978
What?

287
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:37,289
Wedding...

288
00:28:38,992 --> 00:28:40,459
Baadal's here?

289
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:43,863
And he's got a gift for you.

290
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:47,424
Baadal!

291
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:50,368
l'm coming!

292
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:55,397
Baadal!

293
00:28:57,644 --> 00:29:00,272
Baadal!

294
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,741
Baadal!

295
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,756
l'm coming...

296
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,884
Baadal...

297
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:18,430
where are you?

298
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:22,332
Bijlee!
Here l am!

299
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,736
Baadal!

300
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:35,712
Where are you?

301
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:38,248
Bijlee!

302
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,310
Here l am!

303
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:10,807
Baadal...

304
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:12,475
Baadal...

305
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,846
what is this?!

306
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:21,717
The Zulu tribe from South Africa.

307
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:22,989
For you my love.

308
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:24,630
But why?

309
00:30:25,332 --> 00:30:28,597
You told me you love
African folk music.

310
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:30,794
Yeah, but...

311
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:32,733
what l meant was...

312
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:35,707
l went to South
Africa last month...

313
00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:37,776
to inaugurate our new resort.

314
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:40,310
l bought them on a 30 year lease...

315
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:44,076
and the best thing is,
they have no idea.

316
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:06,295
l love you, Baadal.

317
00:31:06,373 --> 00:31:08,500
l love you too, Bijlee!

318
00:33:24,344 --> 00:33:25,971
So, you can see a buffalo?

319
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:27,974
No.

320
00:33:28,648 --> 00:33:30,047
A pink buffalo.

321
00:33:31,284 --> 00:33:32,273
Harry...

322
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:36,586
it's a typical symptom
of Delirium Tremens.

323
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,579
What?

324
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:43,027
Your mind is chemically
dependent on alcohol.

325
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:47,729
You quit drinking suddenly,
and the panic set in.

326
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:52,596
This condition causes
hallucinations...

327
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:55,798
making you delirious... afraid...

328
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:59,072
so that you start drinking again.

329
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:07,014
People imagine seeing bats,
hippopotamus, demons, aliens, worms...

330
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:12,287
You should be happy
all you see is a buffalo.

331
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,587
Pink Buffalo.

332
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:16,393
Gulabbo?

333
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:23,766
Gulabbo is a reflection of your fear.

334
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:26,639
You have to face the buffalo.

335
00:34:27,006 --> 00:34:30,498
Next time, grab her by the horns.

336
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:35,405
At that very moment,
Gulabbo will vanish.

337
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:36,975
Chikoo...

338
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,677
where are you?

339
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:41,916
Bye Chikoo...
l am going to the gym.

340
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,683
Hey Harry!

341
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:45,751
Look at you dear...

342
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:47,417
What happened?

343
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:50,356
Nothing... he saw something.

344
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:53,526
What did you see?

345
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,524
A buffalo.

346
00:34:58,037 --> 00:34:59,766
A pink buffalo.

347
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:05,267
lt's not funny, doc.

348
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:07,276
Pink buffalo!

349
00:35:07,347 --> 00:35:08,336
Chinky!

350
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:10,876
Scrub the floor properly.

351
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,350
l want it spotless.

352
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:15,252
ls the bathroom clean?

353
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:15,810
Yes, madam.

354
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:18,983
Get clean sheets from the mansion.

355
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:20,692
They are cultured people!

356
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:23,791
Who will remove the cobwebs?

357
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:26,557
Go get the broom, the long one.

358
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:27,622
Yes, madam.

359
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,794
About time you got rid of
cobwebs inside your head too.

360
00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:41,471
What?

361
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:44,950
Cobwebs...

362
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:47,577
clean them.

363
00:35:48,788 --> 00:35:50,813
You're looking
like a haunted house.

364
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:56,957
Why can't you ever get
straight to the point?

365
00:35:58,598 --> 00:36:00,930
And why don't you brush
your teeth at night?

366
00:36:04,437 --> 00:36:07,429
Oh God!
You and your sense of humour.

367
00:36:07,974 --> 00:36:09,601
Mulchand.

368
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:11,803
What's for lunch?

369
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:14,239
Mincemeat.

370
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:20,752
Why are you making
mincemeat of your life?

371
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:27,258
You tell me? Why?

372
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,994
Because you suffer from the
Meena Kumari complex.

373
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,337
Who is Meena Kumari?

374
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:47,503
The kids of today!

375
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,008
Superstar of yore...
tragedy queen...

376
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,408
She was gorgeous.

377
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:54,611
A poetess...

378
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:56,849
but she found joy only in sorrow.

379
00:36:58,057 --> 00:37:01,026
Deep down you're
a sad soul yourself.

380
00:37:01,294 --> 00:37:02,488
How?

381
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:06,495
Because you're marrying a moron
and you're okay with it.

382
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,966
Shut up.

383
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,907
l genuinely love him.

384
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:20,005
l've known Baadal since college...

385
00:37:20,747 --> 00:37:21,839
been 5 years now.

386
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,806
l've known you for 20 years now.

387
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,946
Since you were this little.

388
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,286
l used to drop you
to school on a moped.

389
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:32,848
So?

390
00:37:35,328 --> 00:37:36,488
So, l know.

391
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:39,755
What?

392
00:37:43,002 --> 00:37:44,492
You don't love him.

393
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:52,768
Ya!!

394
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:55,346
Because...

395
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:57,713
l love you!

396
00:37:57,784 --> 00:37:59,752
Marry me!

397
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,287
Marry you?
No way!

398
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:09,422
Baadal has businesses
all over the world.

399
00:38:09,862 --> 00:38:12,831
A house in every city.
Do you know that?

400
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:15,891
Of course!
We've funded all of it.

401
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,761
ls that so?

402
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,473
His mother has been in power
for 20 long years.

403
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,306
She's been sucking us dry...

404
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:26,844
and we've been letting her.

405
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:29,949
ln complete silence.

406
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:36,651
The farmers love their land
like their mother.

407
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:45,996
And setting up a factory on
their land against their wishes...

408
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,325
is not acceptable to my government.

409
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:54,635
But the land is... barren, madam.

410
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:58,900
And no farmer has paid
any installment of his loan...

411
00:38:59,412 --> 00:39:00,743
in the past three years.

412
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,942
We don't even have electricity!

413
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,715
We were promised 8
hours of electricity...

414
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:10,519
but we get one hour.

415
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,684
While our crops
dry and wither away...

416
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,629
our quota of electricity is used to
light up the malls in the cities!

417
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:24,666
Uncle, we will increase
your compensation.

418
00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:28,371
850 was the rate decided earlier...

419
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,537
we'll make it 900.

420
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:37,406
You'll buy it for 900
and sell it to Mandola for 5000!

421
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:45,589
And he, in turn will sell
the apartments at a rate of 18,000!

422
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,462
Okay, you fix the price.

423
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,929
Tell me.

424
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,491
We need to ask.

425
00:39:57,737 --> 00:39:58,761
Whom?

426
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,966
Mao.

427
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,313
Oh my!

428
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,043
Who is Mao?

429
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:17,448
A friend of the farmers.

430
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,860
Are your banks open tomorrow?

431
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,908
Why don't you read it aloud?

432
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,777
What does it say?

433
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:47,084
lt's a bank notice.

434
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:50,987
We have to repay the loans...

435
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:52,684
'REPAY WlTHlN THREE DAYS'

436
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:55,387
or they'll seize our land.

437
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,626
l warned you that...

438
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,329
we should take what we get.

439
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:04,968
What does Mao have to say now?

440
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,029
He's left us nowhere!

441
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:08,701
We're ruined!

442
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,979
Fellow farmers...

443
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:20,679
Don't lose hope...

444
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:23,380
We'll fight fire with fire...

445
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,552
We'll strike the oppressors
with our hammer...

446
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,594
...and cut them with our sickle!

447
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:31,764
We'll resolve this at midnight.

448
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:34,831
The red flag is Mao's symbol...

449
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:36,562
assemble where you find it.

450
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:38,729
Your friend, Mao.

451
00:41:46,946 --> 00:41:47,742
Okay...

452
00:41:47,814 --> 00:41:48,838
Knock, knock...

453
00:41:49,782 --> 00:41:50,874
Who's there?

454
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,510
Repeat.

455
00:41:53,653 --> 00:41:54,642
Repeat who?

456
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:57,722
Who... who... who...

457
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,321
God!
Stop it now, Baadal.

458
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:03,956
Come on, Bijlee, he's so cute.

459
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,261
Baadal, one more.

460
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,460
Okay... knock, knock.

461
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,618
Hukum Singh!

462
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:10,326
Mr. Mandola?

463
00:43:10,396 --> 00:43:11,795
Do you see a buffalo behind me?

464
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:16,859
Yes.

465
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,338
A pink buffalo?

466
00:43:20,606 --> 00:43:22,597
Dark pink, Mr. Mandola.

467
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:24,975
You've quit drinking.

468
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:27,573
That's why the
damn buffalo's stalking me.

469
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:32,884
She's coming your way.

470
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:34,417
The pink buffalo?

471
00:43:35,354 --> 00:43:36,878
The dark pink buffalo.

472
00:43:48,601 --> 00:43:49,898
What's wrong?

473
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:56,466
Nothing... l thought it's the...

474
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,601
What?

475
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,974
Buffalo...

476
00:44:07,386 --> 00:44:08,785
The pink buffalo.

477
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,017
lt's not funny, Harry.

478
00:46:32,264 --> 00:46:34,698
Do l look like a buffalo to you?

479
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:37,028
When the heart beats like a bull,

480
00:46:37,636 --> 00:46:40,469
every girl looks like a buffalo,
my dear.

481
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:41,631
Girl?

482
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,275
You just called me a girl!

483
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,455
Knock knock!

484
00:48:39,692 --> 00:48:41,557
Who's there?

485
00:48:43,395 --> 00:48:44,453
ldiot!

486
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,288
ldiot who?

487
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:50,661
The idiot who is looking at me.

488
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,370
You're funny!

489
00:48:58,444 --> 00:48:59,433
Uncle, you're so funny!

490
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:02,708
You've got a funny
sense of humour!

491
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:06,543
How can you spend your life
with this moron?

492
00:49:10,689 --> 00:49:13,419
ldiot has no sense of decency.

493
00:49:14,693 --> 00:49:16,285
And you...

494
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:18,921
you have no sense of drinking!

495
00:49:20,366 --> 00:49:21,924
No more drinks for him.

496
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:24,666
No more drinks for me.

497
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,430
Bijlee...

498
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,672
Lock up all bottles in my cupboard.

499
00:49:30,743 --> 00:49:32,472
Hurry up!

500
00:49:32,544 --> 00:49:33,909
What are you doing, Bijlee?

501
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:35,708
We've got guests.

502
00:49:35,814 --> 00:49:36,974
Drinks anybody?

503
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:39,444
Bar is getting closed
and the food is laid.

504
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,319
One last, one fast.

505
00:49:41,387 --> 00:49:42,479
Every bottle!

506
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,318
One, one last

507
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,718
Just one more, please...

508
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:47,019
No! No more.

509
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,522
A small one?

510
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,292
Do you understand English?

511
00:49:55,401 --> 00:49:56,459
Yes, l do...

512
00:49:58,771 --> 00:50:00,033
l don't think so.

513
00:50:02,308 --> 00:50:03,866
No more.

514
00:50:18,624 --> 00:50:21,684
l'll quit drinking
day after tomorrow...

515
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,759
l'll quit drinking
day after tomorrow...

516
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,964
Can you hear me?

517
00:50:32,037 --> 00:50:35,404
Fine, l'll quit from tomorrow.

518
00:50:36,308 --> 00:50:38,071
Give me a bottle of beer...

519
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:41,411
Bijlee...

520
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,911
All the things l did for you...

521
00:50:46,652 --> 00:50:48,415
Dad...

522
00:50:49,855 --> 00:50:52,050
l want to study in Delhi.''

523
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:56,692
Sure, apple of my eye.

524
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:01,965
l want to go to Oxford...
London to study...

525
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:08,303
Darling,
l'd even send you to the moon!

526
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:12,469
You know...

527
00:51:12,544 --> 00:51:15,479
it's because of you that
l didn't marry again.

528
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,316
And you won't give me
two bottles of beer!

529
00:51:22,421 --> 00:51:23,649
Bijlee!

530
00:51:29,428 --> 00:51:31,828
Two bottles of beer, please.

531
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,998
You know...

532
00:51:36,502 --> 00:51:39,733
l kept away from you
because of your drinking!

533
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,567
And you didn't marry
again because...

534
00:51:45,878 --> 00:51:49,814
after mom passed away,
no woman would've put up with you.

535
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,081
Why?

536
00:52:03,529 --> 00:52:04,791
This is why.

537
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:12,931
Everyone knew
that you have two personalities.

538
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,830
One sober...

539
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:18,674
and the other drunk.

540
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:27,378
My child...

541
00:52:29,288 --> 00:52:33,622
even if l mention
alcohol tomorrow...

542
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,790
you can cut off my tongue.

543
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:41,496
But today...

544
00:52:46,472 --> 00:52:47,734
Okay.

545
00:52:51,977 --> 00:52:53,911
Move your hand away...

546
00:52:54,913 --> 00:52:55,811
What?

547
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,576
There's a lizard...

548
00:52:58,584 --> 00:53:00,575
Dad...

549
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,546
Baadal...

550
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,753
don't let dad get away.

551
00:53:17,669 --> 00:53:18,795
Here...

552
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:21,701
Matru, catch!

553
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:24,338
After him!

554
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:33,443
Matru, you bloody buffoon...

555
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:35,851
Matru, let's go!

556
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,986
Hurry up!

557
00:53:47,866 --> 00:53:51,700
We'll open the bottle,
once we are out.

558
00:53:58,644 --> 00:53:59,668
Knock knock...

559
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:01,779
Who's there?

560
00:54:02,514 --> 00:54:03,606
Mao.

561
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:07,341
l know where Mao is.

562
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:10,855
We lost those idiots!

563
00:54:12,024 --> 00:54:14,492
My throat is parched.

564
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:16,892
You ride, l'll drink.

565
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,987
Stop, l'll ride.

566
00:54:19,031 --> 00:54:20,931
Unless you stop, l can't ride.

567
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:22,762
Unless you ride, l can't stop.

568
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:23,801
Stop!

569
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:24,631
Ride!

570
00:54:24,703 --> 00:54:25,260
Stop...

571
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:25,860
Ride...

572
00:54:25,904 --> 00:54:26,871
Stop!

573
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:51,291
You stupid well!

574
00:54:52,364 --> 00:54:54,559
Move out of my sight!

575
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,024
You broke my bottle!

576
00:54:58,704 --> 00:55:00,365
Gulabbo...

577
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:03,501
Where will l get
another at this hour?

578
00:55:05,444 --> 00:55:07,412
Speak up!

579
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,907
Are you mute?

580
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,344
Stop!

581
00:55:16,722 --> 00:55:18,952
Stop!
Have you lost it?

582
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,821
This stupid well blocks
my path every day.

583
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:30,530
He has to move from there.

584
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,301
l'll talk to him.

585
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,766
Listen carefully, Mr. Well...

586
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,945
He is talking sense.

587
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:45,849
Children walk to school,
women go to the fields...

588
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:48,317
anybody could run into you
and get hurt.

589
00:55:48,854 --> 00:55:52,881
Because you are in an
accident prone area.

590
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:55,786
You have to move out of the way.

591
00:55:57,496 --> 00:55:58,963
Listen, Mr. Well...

592
00:55:59,598 --> 00:56:01,793
your self-respect
is in your own hands.

593
00:56:02,267 --> 00:56:09,264
Step aside or l'll drag you
out of the village!

594
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:15,905
Did you hear, you jerk!

595
00:56:18,717 --> 00:56:20,582
He is calling me a jerk!

596
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:28,756
How dare you called him a jerk?
You bloody buffoon!

597
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:31,491
Now he is abusing me!

598
00:56:31,797 --> 00:56:34,288
Let's drag him away!

599
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:37,698
Where are you taking him?

600
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,293
To the dyers!

601
00:56:39,337 --> 00:56:43,034
The splashing paint
will make the water dirty...

602
00:56:43,308 --> 00:56:44,798
and everyone will fall ill.

603
00:56:49,314 --> 00:56:51,305
Near the bullock cart?

604
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:57,283
Sounds good, let's do it.

605
00:56:57,856 --> 00:56:58,914
Pull...

606
00:56:59,858 --> 00:57:00,882
harder...

607
00:57:00,926 --> 00:57:02,484
with all your energy!

608
00:57:02,894 --> 00:57:03,883
Come on, Harry...

609
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:04,951
come on!

610
00:57:05,731 --> 00:57:06,823
Come on!

611
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:09,230
What the--

612
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:11,995
Give me a hand and pull!

613
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:20,343
Come on, Matru!

614
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:22,880
Let's pull it together.

615
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,284
Let's pull it!

616
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,886
Pull harder...

617
00:57:30,522 --> 00:57:32,649
it's moving...

618
00:57:32,858 --> 00:57:34,416
keep pulling...

619
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,021
Keep pulling...

620
00:57:37,295 --> 00:57:39,024
lt's moving!

621
00:57:39,464 --> 00:57:41,694
Keep pulling...

622
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:46,829
We're almost there...

623
00:57:46,972 --> 00:57:49,873
We made it.
That's enough!

624
00:57:50,408 --> 00:57:52,035
We've made it!

625
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,444
Now that's a job well done!

626
00:58:02,788 --> 00:58:04,255
Matru...

627
00:58:05,323 --> 00:58:06,722
Get some Gulabbo...

628
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:07,918
From where?

629
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,387
The liquor shop.

630
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:12,557
No Gulabbo there.

631
00:58:12,998 --> 00:58:14,522
Then where?

632
00:58:18,937 --> 00:58:20,564
ln the aeroplane.

633
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:23,565
Don't you remember?

634
00:58:23,842 --> 00:58:25,742
We hid a few bottles in it.

635
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:29,646
Matru, my dear...

636
00:58:30,982 --> 00:58:34,383
You bloody buffoon, my friend!

637
00:58:35,253 --> 00:58:37,414
Give me a kiss.

638
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:41,890
Today you want a kiss,
tomorrow you'll want to marry me.

639
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:59,833
l'm not really who l seem to be.

640
00:59:00,979 --> 00:59:02,742
You wait and watch.

641
00:59:03,381 --> 00:59:07,374
First, l will give the land
back to the farmers.

642
00:59:09,354 --> 00:59:13,290
Then, l'll get both of you married
and go on a pilgrimage.

643
00:59:16,494 --> 00:59:18,553
Hey Ram...

644
00:59:24,236 --> 00:59:25,430
Who both?

645
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,732
Bijlee and you.

646
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,471
l won't let her marry that dimwit.

647
00:59:35,247 --> 00:59:36,578
l don't want to get married.

648
00:59:36,648 --> 00:59:37,945
Why not?

649
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:41,977
ls Bijlee ugly?

650
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,412
No.

651
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:49,285
ls she mad... illiterate... sick?

652
00:59:50,729 --> 00:59:55,029
ls she not suitable...
or is she a man?

653
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,894
She is your daughter.

654
01:00:22,027 --> 01:00:23,426
What?

655
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:31,401
l've seen both of you since you were
kids... what a lovely pair you make.

656
01:00:32,871 --> 01:00:35,840
You're like Mukesh and Nita Ambani.

657
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:37,975
Have you lost it?

658
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,835
l don't want to be Mukesh Ambani.

659
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:44,971
Then become his brother,
Anil Ambani.

660
01:00:48,586 --> 01:00:51,680
A servant can never
become an Ambani.

661
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,853
l'm leaving.

662
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:54,858
Where you off to?

663
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,356
How about a night
walk in the plane?

664
01:01:00,832 --> 01:01:01,924
Sit.

665
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:09,535
You are right.

666
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:15,536
Once you marry Bijlee, Ambani will
be your servant and you his master.

667
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:18,514
l'd much rather be a slave.

668
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:20,446
So you won't?

669
01:01:20,518 --> 01:01:21,610
No.

670
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:23,913
Think about it.

671
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,581
Thought about it.

672
01:01:25,824 --> 01:01:28,952
l'd rather die than
have you as my father-in-law!

673
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:35,965
Fine!

674
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,700
Then prepare to die with
your never-to-be father-in-law.

675
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:41,736
Harry, what are you doing?

676
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:43,999
Harry...

677
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,702
We're going on a night walk.

678
01:01:45,777 --> 01:01:47,768
This isn't a joke!

679
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:50,439
Stop!

680
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:52,779
The night walk will be fun...

681
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,461
Harry, are you crazy?
We'll die!

682
01:02:12,303 --> 01:02:14,828
Are you ready to marry?

683
01:02:16,408 --> 01:02:17,739
No.

684
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:20,470
Then die!

685
01:02:26,518 --> 01:02:29,487
Please forgive me...

686
01:02:29,554 --> 01:02:31,818
Forgive you?

687
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,034
You fool!

688
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:56,677
Your daughter,
your buffalo, your car...

689
01:02:56,748 --> 01:03:01,310
trousers, shoes, shirt, watch...
l'll marry all of them!

690
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:07,256
Thank you, Almighty God.
Thank you.

691
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:09,886
Now let's go down.

692
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,725
Damn!

693
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,638
So many switches!

694
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,398
What is it?

695
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:31,508
l know how to take off
but l don't know how to land.

696
01:03:43,628 --> 01:03:45,562
Don't worry!

697
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:48,492
There are some
parachutes at the back.

698
01:03:56,908 --> 01:03:59,900
ln case of an emergency...

699
01:04:00,311 --> 01:04:05,772
strap on the parachute
and fasten the buckles.

700
01:04:06,484 --> 01:04:11,581
Do remember to open
the parachute upon jumping.

701
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,020
lf it opens, you're lucky!

702
01:04:15,627 --> 01:04:18,528
lf it doesn't, well...
you've had it!

703
01:04:21,499 --> 01:04:25,765
Matru... grab the controls.

704
01:04:25,837 --> 01:04:27,668
l'll have a sip...

705
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,673
one for the road.

706
01:04:30,808 --> 01:04:33,299
Whoa!
You're crazy, Harry!

707
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:36,641
This is no time for a drink.
Jump, you idiot!

708
01:04:36,714 --> 01:04:38,978
You got a light?

709
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:45,552
Fire!

710
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,023
Fire?

711
01:04:47,725 --> 01:04:49,386
Then give it to me.

712
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,825
The engine is on fire!

713
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:52,590
Jump, will you!

714
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,799
Hang on!
Let me light up my cigar.

715
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,065
Where are you going?

716
01:04:58,469 --> 01:04:59,629
Harry!

717
01:04:59,704 --> 01:05:01,934
Harry, get inside!

718
01:05:04,576 --> 01:05:09,275
Harry, for the last time,
are you jumping or not?

719
01:05:10,548 --> 01:05:13,278
Smoking kills...

720
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:15,443
Then die!

721
01:05:16,354 --> 01:05:17,343
Matru...

722
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:19,549
God have mercy!

723
01:05:24,696 --> 01:05:27,028
Gulabbo have mercy!

724
01:05:33,738 --> 01:05:38,505
Matru, my luck held!
My parachute opened.

725
01:06:09,574 --> 01:06:11,508
lt's past midnight.

726
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,971
Where is Mao?

727
01:06:15,246 --> 01:06:18,409
Look... there he is!

728
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:23,250
Look!! Mao!!

729
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:33,323
Mao! Mao!

730
01:06:39,337 --> 01:06:45,298
The court has increased the
loan repayment time to 3 months!

731
01:06:46,944 --> 01:06:48,935
Mao... this way...

732
01:06:50,014 --> 01:06:52,608
Careful Mr. Mao...

733
01:06:58,923 --> 01:07:00,322
Ni hao, Mao.

734
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,859
Huanying... Mandola village.

735
01:07:03,328 --> 01:07:04,761
Ni hao, Mao!

736
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:11,358
Hello morons!

737
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:19,542
Matru?
You are Mao?

738
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:22,306
Yes.

739
01:07:23,614 --> 01:07:26,447
Until we get our land back...

740
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,353
this should remain a secret.

741
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:46,835
The red flag is Mao's symbol...

742
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:52,265
l want that son-of-a-gun Mao alive!

743
01:07:54,846 --> 01:07:58,475
Mandola's peasants!
Mao offers his red salute!

744
01:07:58,549 --> 01:08:01,279
Mao is a cross-dresser?

745
01:08:02,887 --> 01:08:04,752
Mao speaks through me.

746
01:08:08,893 --> 01:08:12,624
You scoundrel... don't you
have any shame?

747
01:08:12,697 --> 01:08:14,892
Why don't you show yourself, Mao?

748
01:08:15,233 --> 01:08:17,929
l will, when the time is right!

749
01:08:18,436 --> 01:08:20,427
l will, when the time is right!

750
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,003
Danger is lurking around.

751
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:23,533
The enemy is very...

752
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:24,900
ls very what?

753
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:28,309
stab me in the back... knife...

754
01:08:28,379 --> 01:08:29,573
Got it.

755
01:08:29,747 --> 01:08:30,941
That's him.

756
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:35,315
The enemy wants to
ruin your mama's pudding.

757
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:39,618
Before he can do that,
we must ruin his mama's pudding.

758
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,454
You hear me?

759
01:08:41,526 --> 01:08:42,754
Just repeat what l'm saying,
you jerk!

760
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,022
Repeat what l'm saying, you jerks!

761
01:08:45,596 --> 01:08:46,620
Say it!

762
01:08:46,697 --> 01:08:49,291
Mama's pudding!

763
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,967
Naseeban, you moron!

764
01:08:51,035 --> 01:08:52,832
Naseeban, you mo--

765
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,274
What did you say?
Are you calling me a moron?

766
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,273
l'm leaving...

767
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:00,008
Naseeban...

768
01:09:00,478 --> 01:09:01,809
Sorry...

769
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,304
Please, come back!

770
01:09:03,548 --> 01:09:04,947
Just repeat after me...

771
01:09:05,216 --> 01:09:06,615
That's what l'm doing...

772
01:09:09,654 --> 01:09:14,318
Mao has got a stay
order from the court.

773
01:09:14,392 --> 01:09:16,451
And he gives you his word...

774
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:20,258
that our crops will sell
at the rates we want.

775
01:09:20,298 --> 01:09:22,789
Let's hear it for Mao!

776
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:27,800
The court has given
us three months.

777
01:09:28,272 --> 01:09:31,366
But in three weeks
we'll harvest our crops...

778
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:33,410
and repay all our debts.

779
01:09:33,478 --> 01:09:36,606
We won't let them build a factory
on our farms.

780
01:10:20,947 --> 01:10:24,713
A UFO crashed in Mandola
village last night.

781
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:29,719
This has led to hysteria
amongst the nation's scientists.

782
01:10:29,956 --> 01:10:34,416
Senior researchers from the
lndian Space Research Organization...

783
01:10:34,493 --> 01:10:38,395
are here to investigate
the crash site.

784
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:41,826
Fortunately, there was
moisture in the fields...

785
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:45,898
otherwise the explosion
would have caused a fire.

786
01:10:46,606 --> 01:10:48,801
What's shocking is...

787
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:52,640
not a single fragment of
the UFO...

788
01:10:52,712 --> 01:10:54,680
has been found at the crash site.

789
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:57,713
Shocking!

790
01:10:58,417 --> 01:11:01,352
The precinct was up all night
clearing the rubble.

791
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:02,888
Shocking!

792
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:10,624
Nainsukh is the only eyewitness
to the crash.

793
01:11:11,464 --> 01:11:15,230
Kindly tell our audience
what happened last night.

794
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:16,458
Loose motions...

795
01:11:16,802 --> 01:11:17,632
Loose motions?

796
01:11:18,004 --> 01:11:21,701
Last night l had chicken for dinner...

797
01:11:21,774 --> 01:11:25,369
and that filthy chicken was clucking
away to glory inside my tummy.

798
01:11:26,379 --> 01:11:28,711
Chicken clucking in the tummy!

799
01:11:28,848 --> 01:11:29,712
lncredible...

800
01:11:30,216 --> 01:11:31,376
And then...?

801
01:11:31,817 --> 01:11:35,583
l ran to the fields
barely able to control my motions...

802
01:11:35,621 --> 01:11:37,486
And crapped for two hours straight!

803
01:11:38,824 --> 01:11:41,292
Crapped for two hours straight! Wow!

804
01:11:41,327 --> 01:11:42,351
But...

805
01:11:42,428 --> 01:11:44,555
What about the UFO?

806
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,956
l was done crapping and
was pulling up my underwear...

807
01:11:48,234 --> 01:11:52,898
when a mighty gust of wind
blew my underwear away.

808
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:58,273
Tell us, did you see the UFO
with your own eyes?

809
01:11:58,844 --> 01:12:00,607
Are you blind?
You idiot!

810
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,875
Can't you see
that l can't see??

811
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:04,673
Where's your camera?

812
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:05,842
Why do you want that?

813
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:07,646
Careful, it might break.

814
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,778
Step aside you jerk!

815
01:12:09,255 --> 01:12:12,452
l have a humble request
to the viewers...

816
01:12:12,892 --> 01:12:14,723
if anybody finds my underwear...

817
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:18,753
red colour, VlP brand with 5 holes.
2 in the front and 3 at the back!

818
01:12:18,831 --> 01:12:20,355
Please return them to me.

819
01:12:20,433 --> 01:12:23,163
Don't wear them.

820
01:13:24,597 --> 01:13:28,260
Now you know? What sets
you apart from Rahul?

821
01:13:28,768 --> 01:13:29,860
Or Varun?

822
01:13:30,903 --> 01:13:33,701
Or Jyotiraditya, Sachin and Milind?

823
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,509
They are all responsible kids.

824
01:13:38,177 --> 01:13:40,202
They don't go around
risking their life.

825
01:13:40,913 --> 01:13:44,440
And that's why their parents
are happy and prosperous.

826
01:13:47,186 --> 01:13:49,177
What are you doing, you bitch!

827
01:13:51,924 --> 01:13:54,586
That's no way to speak
to your fiancee.

828
01:13:55,661 --> 01:13:56,525
Sorry...

829
01:13:56,896 --> 01:13:58,796
What are you doing, darling?

830
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:03,334
- Bijlee...
- Babe!

831
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:06,928
l'm sorry... come back!

832
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:13,844
Mom...

833
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,254
Why is she marrying you?

834
01:14:23,456 --> 01:14:24,889
For love.

835
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:27,590
And her father?

836
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,352
For land...

837
01:14:31,664 --> 01:14:32,392
And we?

838
01:14:32,765 --> 01:14:34,790
For power.

839
01:14:36,302 --> 01:14:37,166
Mom!

840
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,906
lt's not about love or power...

841
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:46,337
not farmers or their land...

842
01:14:47,179 --> 01:14:49,477
or about villages, towns and cities.

843
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:53,878
What's at stake here, is the nation.

844
01:14:59,525 --> 01:15:02,221
A nation is made up of its people.

845
01:15:02,528 --> 01:15:05,292
People, the masses.

846
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:08,695
And the masses have no identity.

847
01:15:09,735 --> 01:15:11,635
lt's their leader
who gives them an identity.

848
01:15:12,471 --> 01:15:15,235
My character is the
character of my leader.

849
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:17,434
and thus the character
of my nation.

850
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:21,238
When l was spiritual,
the nation was Buddha.

851
01:15:21,447 --> 01:15:23,881
When l was sensual,
King Mihirkula.

852
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:28,483
When l was weak, Alexander
and when l was divided, Babur.

853
01:15:29,522 --> 01:15:33,424
When l traded,
the nation became a slave.

854
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:36,818
And my rebellion led to freedom.

855
01:15:38,197 --> 01:15:42,361
Freedom led to greed...

856
01:15:42,434 --> 01:15:44,493
greed to corruption,
corruption to wealth...

857
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:47,630
wealth to success,
success to progress!

858
01:15:49,408 --> 01:15:50,636
Progress!

859
01:15:53,746 --> 01:15:55,407
So, tell me...

860
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:58,678
why are you really getting married
to Mandola's daughter?

861
01:16:00,786 --> 01:16:01,753
Progress...

862
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:04,553
For the country's progress.

863
01:16:05,591 --> 01:16:11,393
For the country to progress,
my personal progress is necessary!

864
01:16:24,276 --> 01:16:26,267
lf we get a rate of 1500 rupees...

865
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:28,473
What does it add up to?

866
01:16:28,747 --> 01:16:31,443
3 and a half million.

867
01:16:32,184 --> 01:16:35,347
Deduct labour charges and transport.

868
01:16:35,788 --> 01:16:39,815
Even after repaying the loan,
every family will save 50,000 rupees.

869
01:16:41,193 --> 01:16:42,592
Matru...

870
01:16:42,795 --> 01:16:44,490
thank god you're back...

871
01:16:45,598 --> 01:16:46,622
or we would've been doomed.

872
01:16:47,533 --> 01:16:48,932
We would've been doomed.

873
01:16:51,804 --> 01:16:55,171
Chaudhary Devi is performing
a ceremony to pray for rains.

874
01:16:55,574 --> 01:16:58,634
So that our crops are destroyed.

875
01:17:00,713 --> 01:17:02,374
[Chanting]

876
01:17:20,332 --> 01:17:21,526
Nonsense!

877
01:17:22,901 --> 01:17:26,268
So if its raining in Chennai,
do l shift the land there?

878
01:17:26,338 --> 01:17:27,703
When is it going to rain here, dammit?

879
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,174
l had warned you...

880
01:17:30,242 --> 01:17:31,607
stop the supply of seeds.

881
01:17:32,344 --> 01:17:33,868
But you chose to ignore me.

882
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,404
Now good luck
with your ritual and...

883
01:17:36,482 --> 01:17:38,416
pray that the crops get destroyed.

884
01:17:40,753 --> 01:17:41,777
Bad news...

885
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:46,857
the MET department says that
the monsoon clouds may head this way.

886
01:17:47,526 --> 01:17:50,427
They say, it might rain
day after tomorrow.

887
01:17:50,696 --> 01:17:53,426
Even the gods can't make it rain now.

888
01:17:53,499 --> 01:17:54,830
Now what?

889
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,798
l don't know.

890
01:17:55,868 --> 01:17:57,392
Atrazine...

891
01:17:57,736 --> 01:17:58,725
What?!

892
01:18:02,741 --> 01:18:04,766
ClA's secret formula...

893
01:18:04,843 --> 01:18:05,810
a herbicide.

894
01:18:07,713 --> 01:18:11,308
Spray a little bit and
the pests are destroyed but...

895
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:17,411
spray just a little bit more
and the crops get destroyed.

896
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:20,284
And the land remains barren...

897
01:18:20,759 --> 01:18:21,726
for years.

898
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:39,140
l hope you are not angry anymore.

899
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,541
Scared, aren't you?

900
01:18:43,716 --> 01:18:45,183
About the marriage.

901
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:46,413
Hmm...

902
01:18:46,919 --> 01:18:47,851
Don't worry.

903
01:18:48,654 --> 01:18:51,316
This time nothing will come
in the way of our marriage.

904
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:53,881
Really?

905
01:18:55,594 --> 01:19:01,533
Tomorrow morning the crops and land
will be destroyed.

906
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:03,391
lt'll happen tonight.

907
01:19:06,305 --> 01:19:06,669
What?

908
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:11,540
Operation Mao Mao.

909
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:13,168
Mao Mao...

910
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:19,911
Have you seen Matru?

911
01:19:23,589 --> 01:19:24,886
Matru!!

912
01:19:38,504 --> 01:19:39,471
Matru!!

913
01:19:42,474 --> 01:19:43,873
Matru!!

914
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:46,837
Up here!

915
01:19:48,147 --> 01:19:48,909
What's wrong?

916
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:50,273
Why are you yelling
like crazy?

917
01:19:50,482 --> 01:19:51,506
l finally know...

918
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:53,274
What?

919
01:19:54,553 --> 01:19:55,679
That l have it.

920
01:19:56,555 --> 01:19:57,385
Have what?

921
01:19:58,724 --> 01:19:59,691
l...

922
01:20:02,461 --> 01:20:04,622
l have the Meena Kumari complex.

923
01:20:45,204 --> 01:20:47,604
lt's exactly 2300 hours.

924
01:20:48,373 --> 01:20:51,865
And we will
strike precisely at zero hours.

925
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:54,907
ls that clear?

926
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,269
Sir!

927
01:21:01,887 --> 01:21:04,754
This operation will be called...

928
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:07,382
Mao Mao.

929
01:21:17,903 --> 01:21:18,927
Check it properly.

930
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,664
Sir!

931
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:24,437
At ease!

932
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:28,336
Every commander will have
25 soldiers in his unit.

933
01:21:28,413 --> 01:21:30,381
You will lead from the north...

934
01:21:30,482 --> 01:21:31,744
you from the south.

935
01:21:31,783 --> 01:21:32,477
Sir!

936
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:34,542
- You from the west.
- Sir!

937
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,248
And l from the east.

938
01:21:37,289 --> 01:21:38,483
Copy that?

939
01:21:38,557 --> 01:21:39,455
Copy!

940
01:21:39,524 --> 01:21:40,286
Good.

941
01:21:43,962 --> 01:21:46,294
The code for danger is Mao.

942
01:21:46,798 --> 01:21:50,234
And the code for danger averted is--
Where is it?!

943
01:21:50,302 --> 01:21:52,770
The code for danger averted is
Mao Mao.

944
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:59,268
All the best for the operation!

945
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,845
Rain drops are falling on my head...

946
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:16,523
falling... on my head?!

947
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,537
Rain drops are falling on my head...

948
01:22:42,487 --> 01:22:44,478
Smells like cow dung.

949
01:22:46,525 --> 01:22:48,823
A buffalo in the sky?

950
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:52,457
Hello...

951
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:53,930
Team A reporting Mao.

952
01:22:54,366 --> 01:22:57,563
This is team B reporting Mao Mao.

953
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,632
Team A reporting Mao.

954
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:01,603
Mao Mao.

955
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:04,534
Not Mao Mao.
l say Mao.

956
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:07,476
You hear Mao Mao.
Not Mao Mao, Mao.

957
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,480
Mao!

958
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:14,849
Who's there?
Mao or Mao Mao?!

959
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,781
Shokeen? Dahiya?

960
01:23:23,929 --> 01:23:26,557
Hello, this is Team B reporting...

961
01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:28,799
M-A-O... M-A-O
Mao Mao.

962
01:23:28,934 --> 01:23:30,561
Now listen to me carefully.

963
01:23:31,636 --> 01:23:34,605
Take cover and no
movement till my next order.

964
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,672
Copy!

965
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:37,299
Sit down!

966
01:23:37,676 --> 01:23:39,541
Sit down!

967
01:23:40,212 --> 01:23:41,702
Lie low...

968
01:23:42,414 --> 01:23:44,405
Lie low...Sit down you idiot!

969
01:23:44,683 --> 01:23:45,707
Copy copy!

970
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:07,366
Mao... Mao...

971
01:24:12,677 --> 01:24:13,541
Fire!

972
01:24:13,745 --> 01:24:14,939
Yo mama's pudding!

973
01:28:36,841 --> 01:28:38,866
This is good grain, Patwari...

974
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:40,810
brilliant!

975
01:28:41,379 --> 01:28:42,505
1000 rupees.

976
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:44,241
That's it?

977
01:28:44,316 --> 01:28:46,409
Come on guys,
you can do better than that.

978
01:28:46,484 --> 01:28:47,781
1200 rupees.

979
01:28:47,919 --> 01:28:49,477
1400 rupees.

980
01:28:50,322 --> 01:28:51,186
1500 rupees.

981
01:28:51,356 --> 01:28:53,551
1500... 1500 going once...

982
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:54,785
Patwari... 1500 rupees?

983
01:28:56,561 --> 01:28:57,755
1500 going once...

984
01:28:58,596 --> 01:28:59,494
1500 going twice--

985
01:28:59,564 --> 01:29:01,293
Hold on!

986
01:29:01,599 --> 01:29:04,898
There is an order to not
buy grain from Mandola village.

987
01:29:05,303 --> 01:29:05,632
What?

988
01:29:05,704 --> 01:29:06,636
Yeah!

989
01:29:07,906 --> 01:29:10,431
Get rid of this rubbish.
Let's check the next lot.

990
01:29:10,775 --> 01:29:11,503
What happened?

991
01:29:13,878 --> 01:29:17,712
Your grain failed
the quality control test.

992
01:29:18,783 --> 01:29:19,647
What?

993
01:29:20,218 --> 01:29:23,381
You were quite excited when
you saw it this morning...

994
01:29:23,722 --> 01:29:27,180
ln the morning, they didn't know
the name of your village.

995
01:29:28,326 --> 01:29:30,556
Tell Mao to get a stay order
from the court.

996
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:37,392
Let's go!

997
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:44,800
Matru...

998
01:29:44,876 --> 01:29:48,471
They have got our grains rejected
in all the markets.

999
01:29:50,215 --> 01:29:53,150
We can't sell our grains anywhere.

1000
01:29:54,486 --> 01:29:55,714
What can we do now?

1001
01:30:05,864 --> 01:30:08,492
She is in a board meeting,
and l can't disturb her right now.

1002
01:30:10,935 --> 01:30:11,663
Okay.

1003
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:13,728
l'll wait.

1004
01:30:22,447 --> 01:30:22,913
Hukka!

1005
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:26,911
This is a surprise!

1006
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:29,752
So good to see you.

1007
01:30:31,756 --> 01:30:33,951
l can't believe you are still alive,
you dog!

1008
01:30:34,426 --> 01:30:35,825
Well so are you, you witch!

1009
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:48,338
So...

1010
01:30:48,406 --> 01:30:50,306
when's that revolution of
yours coming?

1011
01:30:50,675 --> 01:30:52,734
As soon as you buy the grains.

1012
01:30:57,649 --> 01:31:00,846
There is a system for that, Hukka.

1013
01:31:01,986 --> 01:31:04,420
System... in this country?

1014
01:31:06,491 --> 01:31:08,322
Kiddo, there you are.

1015
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,691
Look at this e-mail, listen...

1016
01:31:10,762 --> 01:31:13,595
The Australians are getting
really impatient. We have to--

1017
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:16,860
Who's smoking a cigarette?

1018
01:31:18,002 --> 01:31:19,765
lt's a beedi, actually.

1019
01:31:23,575 --> 01:31:24,701
Hukum.

1020
01:31:25,743 --> 01:31:27,904
JN University...
Hukum?

1021
01:31:28,179 --> 01:31:28,907
Hukka!

1022
01:31:29,614 --> 01:31:31,445
When's that revolution of
yours coming?

1023
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:36,512
Actually, she has told me
a lot about you guys.

1024
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:40,652
- Except that l never--
- Percy Shroff, my husband!

1025
01:31:41,626 --> 01:31:43,355
Oh yeah!
Hello!

1026
01:31:49,834 --> 01:31:50,732
So you were saying...

1027
01:31:52,337 --> 01:31:52,860
Yeah...

1028
01:31:53,705 --> 01:31:57,266
Until there is a middle man
in the system...

1029
01:31:57,342 --> 01:31:59,708
Yeah right l understand--
Middle man.

1030
01:31:59,777 --> 01:32:00,903
Sure, l understand.

1031
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:01,911
l'll go.

1032
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,538
Hey, l didn't mean that!

1033
01:32:10,922 --> 01:32:11,786
Coffee?

1034
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:14,553
Kamini...

1035
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,557
300 families will lose
their land and livelihood.

1036
01:32:19,697 --> 01:32:21,187
Somebody has to do something.

1037
01:32:31,209 --> 01:32:33,643
We have an urgent delivery
to Australia.

1038
01:32:33,711 --> 01:32:37,670
lf you could arrange the delivery in
the next 5 days then...

1039
01:32:38,683 --> 01:32:40,207
We have a deal.

1040
01:32:41,953 --> 01:32:42,942
Should l say thanks?

1041
01:32:43,821 --> 01:32:44,549
Why not?!

1042
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,422
l need an advance.

1043
01:32:54,265 --> 01:32:56,233
You commie bastard!

1044
01:32:56,634 --> 01:32:58,192
You bourgeois bitch!

1045
01:33:13,885 --> 01:33:14,909
Stop this racket!

1046
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:20,354
Stop!

1047
01:33:21,492 --> 01:33:23,585
What's with this racket!

1048
01:33:24,896 --> 01:33:26,921
The first installment of our loan.

1049
01:33:27,865 --> 01:33:30,891
And in 10 days you will get
the last too.

1050
01:33:31,169 --> 01:33:33,330
Here... have some sweets.

1051
01:33:35,907 --> 01:33:37,636
What happened to the music?

1052
01:34:11,909 --> 01:34:16,778
Every time l see these hideous crops
in this green wasteland...

1053
01:34:17,715 --> 01:34:20,650
my dream stings my eyes.

1054
01:34:22,587 --> 01:34:24,145
My dream of...

1055
01:34:26,658 --> 01:34:29,354
gigantic earth movers...

1056
01:34:29,427 --> 01:34:31,861
bulldozers, stone crushers...

1057
01:34:35,233 --> 01:34:36,427
industrial cranes...

1058
01:34:38,903 --> 01:34:41,599
dry cement floating in the air.

1059
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:44,741
Thousands of labourers
toiling away.

1060
01:34:46,511 --> 01:34:49,639
Smoke spewing factories...

1061
01:34:49,714 --> 01:34:51,409
howling furnaces...

1062
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:54,551
and bellowing chimneys.

1063
01:34:57,689 --> 01:35:02,558
On one side,
a housing project for the workers.

1064
01:35:03,261 --> 01:35:04,387
And on the other...

1065
01:35:04,962 --> 01:35:10,195
gleaming, high, twin shopping malls.

1066
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:16,272
Do you see the film posters
on the billboards of the multiplex?

1067
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:17,500
l see them!

1068
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,373
With one hand we're
paying money to the factory workers...

1069
01:35:25,917 --> 01:35:28,750
and taking it back with the other
at the shopping malls.

1070
01:35:33,725 --> 01:35:39,425
The serpentine smoke rising from the
factory chimneys is...

1071
01:35:39,464 --> 01:35:42,922
painting our destiny on the canvas
of the evening sky.

1072
01:35:44,802 --> 01:35:48,636
Mandola's...

1073
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:53,836
Harry!

1074
01:35:56,581 --> 01:35:58,276
This isn't a dream.

1075
01:35:58,816 --> 01:36:02,616
This is the mother of all dreams!

1076
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:09,954
l can do anything to make this
dream come true.

1077
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:13,619
Anything?

1078
01:36:14,398 --> 01:36:14,921
Anything.

1079
01:36:17,969 --> 01:36:18,663
Such as?

1080
01:36:27,378 --> 01:36:30,313
Go on Harry,
why did you stop?

1081
01:36:33,518 --> 01:36:36,146
Tell me...

1082
01:36:36,654 --> 01:36:39,885
What can you do to
make this dream come true?

1083
01:36:41,793 --> 01:36:43,522
Say it...

1084
01:36:43,661 --> 01:36:44,559
Please!

1085
01:36:46,664 --> 01:36:48,188
l will give up alcohol.

1086
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:55,432
Forever?

1087
01:36:56,808 --> 01:36:57,797
Yes!

1088
01:37:00,311 --> 01:37:01,801
You swear on Bijlee?

1089
01:37:06,651 --> 01:37:08,448
l swear on Bijlee!

1090
01:37:15,193 --> 01:37:17,787
Harry, it's raining!

1091
01:37:20,398 --> 01:37:22,866
Everything is washed out.

1092
01:37:25,236 --> 01:37:26,863
Ruined!

1093
01:38:05,776 --> 01:38:07,767
Rush to Chaudhari's farm,
he must be alone.

1094
01:38:07,845 --> 01:38:09,278
All of you meet me
at the warehouse...

1095
01:38:09,347 --> 01:38:11,872
the harvest is there,
rain water shouldn't leak in.

1096
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:18,286
Hurry up!

1097
01:39:01,832 --> 01:39:02,526
Wow!

1098
01:39:11,842 --> 01:39:13,173
Bijlee!

1099
01:40:43,667 --> 01:40:46,534
This is not the time
to lose hope.

1100
01:40:48,205 --> 01:40:50,833
lt's time to keep
the fire burning inside you!

1101
01:40:51,776 --> 01:40:56,770
A prayer from the heart,
always comes true.

1102
01:40:57,448 --> 01:41:02,385
This isn't just rain,
but showers of blessings.

1103
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:04,412
Thank god!

1104
01:41:05,856 --> 01:41:07,323
Remember...

1105
01:41:07,425 --> 01:41:10,417
Unless we concede defeat,
they cannot win!

1106
01:41:11,762 --> 01:41:13,787
They have no way out.

1107
01:41:13,964 --> 01:41:17,263
Shokeen,
prepare the acquisition papers.

1108
01:41:17,902 --> 01:41:20,427
Farmers all over the country
are with us.

1109
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:24,772
Tomorrow, we will march
all the way to Delhi.

1110
01:41:25,276 --> 01:41:29,542
New Delhi, the seat of power,
is within reach!

1111
01:41:30,514 --> 01:41:33,312
Cheers!

1112
01:42:17,361 --> 01:42:19,420
Lalbihari!

1113
01:42:24,735 --> 01:42:25,861
Patwari!

1114
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:08,674
l, Lal Bihari Sarohi,

1115
01:43:08,746 --> 01:43:12,204
son of Babu Lal Sarohi,
resident of Mandola...

1116
01:43:12,283 --> 01:43:14,217
have freely and without encumbrance,

1117
01:43:14,285 --> 01:43:18,483
handed over my land
to the state government.

1118
01:43:18,656 --> 01:43:24,492
l accept the compensation
given in return for this.

1119
01:43:25,596 --> 01:43:27,757
Generally l'm not so corrupt...

1120
01:43:30,167 --> 01:43:31,259
you know that.

1121
01:43:32,937 --> 01:43:36,202
l'm doing this for love.

1122
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:40,677
Not for you!

1123
01:43:40,844 --> 01:43:42,334
For the love of Baadal.

1124
01:43:44,615 --> 01:43:47,277
Also my son-in-law.

1125
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:58,751
Not yet.

1126
01:44:00,197 --> 01:44:03,826
There's many a slip,
between cup and lip.

1127
01:44:11,742 --> 01:44:13,903
On the day of the marriage,
give your daughter...

1128
01:44:13,978 --> 01:44:17,539
and take the signature.

1129
01:44:26,657 --> 01:44:28,454
- Call the PM's office!
- Yes, Madam.

1130
01:44:55,419 --> 01:45:00,322
Guess who told the villagers
about Operation Mao Mao?

1131
01:45:01,458 --> 01:45:02,720
Who?

1132
01:45:08,766 --> 01:45:09,630
The fan?

1133
01:45:16,674 --> 01:45:19,575
The bulb?
What are you saying, mom?

1134
01:45:26,216 --> 01:45:27,740
Tube light?

1135
01:45:35,559 --> 01:45:36,685
Bijlee!

1136
01:45:37,895 --> 01:45:39,192
l will kill the--

1137
01:45:40,431 --> 01:45:41,455
Shhh..!

1138
01:45:43,901 --> 01:45:45,334
Silly boy...

1139
01:45:46,303 --> 01:45:49,329
lf you kill her,
who will you marry?

1140
01:45:51,909 --> 01:45:56,812
And anything is possible
after marriage...

1141
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:57,744
anything!

1142
01:46:04,188 --> 01:46:09,251
Our progress depends on
Mandola's property...

1143
01:46:10,694 --> 01:46:13,492
and Mandola's property
depends on this marriage.

1144
01:46:14,465 --> 01:46:20,335
Therefore,
nothing should stop this marriage.

1145
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:25,172
And nothing will.
l promise!

1146
01:46:35,452 --> 01:46:37,352
What will you do?

1147
01:46:38,589 --> 01:46:39,715
ln Delhi?

1148
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:44,659
l'll work for the community,
teach at the University.

1149
01:46:46,463 --> 01:46:48,454
Don't you care about me?

1150
01:46:48,766 --> 01:46:49,790
Nope.

1151
01:46:51,802 --> 01:46:53,531
Do you have a girlfriend?

1152
01:46:54,171 --> 01:46:54,933
ln Delhi?

1153
01:47:08,685 --> 01:47:09,583
Do you?

1154
01:47:12,222 --> 01:47:13,382
Yeah.

1155
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:16,751
What's her name?

1156
01:47:19,863 --> 01:47:21,694
Sheila Dikshit, the Chief Minister.

1157
01:47:31,775 --> 01:47:32,742
Listen!

1158
01:47:38,449 --> 01:47:40,917
There is something l have to say...

1159
01:47:47,491 --> 01:47:48,719
l have...

1160
01:47:51,929 --> 01:47:55,160
l've started brushing
my teeth at night.

1161
01:48:13,684 --> 01:48:17,620
l don't have the heart to watch
the factory replace our farms.

1162
01:48:24,394 --> 01:48:27,363
Once you get married your
mother-in-law will sign the papers...

1163
01:48:27,431 --> 01:48:29,524
and declare the farms a
Special Economic Zone.

1164
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,619
What if there is no marriage?

1165
01:48:59,863 --> 01:49:01,262
Matru!

1166
01:49:03,867 --> 01:49:05,266
We love you!

1167
01:49:28,659 --> 01:49:29,523
Daddy...

1168
01:49:31,662 --> 01:49:34,722
Which one of these should
l wear this evening?

1169
01:49:34,898 --> 01:49:36,763
This or this?

1170
01:49:39,303 --> 01:49:41,737
As you wish,
you'll still look the same.

1171
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,805
Fine, l'll ask Bijlee.

1172
01:49:45,509 --> 01:49:46,203
Bijlee!

1173
01:49:53,784 --> 01:49:54,751
Matru!

1174
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,615
l'm scared...

1175
01:49:59,723 --> 01:50:00,690
What do l do?

1176
01:50:02,759 --> 01:50:03,919
Tell you what...

1177
01:50:07,464 --> 01:50:08,328
don't be scared.

1178
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:15,303
Be serious.

1179
01:50:16,273 --> 01:50:18,332
Are we doing the
right thing?

1180
01:50:22,879 --> 01:50:26,178
Fair is foul and foul is fair.

1181
01:50:26,917 --> 01:50:29,511
Hover through the fog
and filthy air.

1182
01:50:37,461 --> 01:50:38,257
Excuse me!

1183
01:50:38,462 --> 01:50:39,224
Yes?

1184
01:50:39,663 --> 01:50:40,857
Have you seen Bijlee?

1185
01:50:41,264 --> 01:50:42,458
Yeah!

1186
01:50:42,666 --> 01:50:43,530
Where?

1187
01:50:43,734 --> 01:50:47,363
You know the lake inside,
she is swimming there.

1188
01:50:47,604 --> 01:50:48,536
Thank you... thank you very much.

1189
01:50:48,739 --> 01:50:49,831
You are welcome!

1190
01:51:44,561 --> 01:51:47,792
Are you ready for
Operation Wedding Night?

1191
01:51:48,432 --> 01:51:50,423
Of course l am.

1192
01:51:51,435 --> 01:51:56,668
l'll add sleeping pills
to Baadal's glass of milk tonight.

1193
01:51:58,341 --> 01:52:02,744
And l'll make sure he has the milk.

1194
01:52:02,913 --> 01:52:06,747
Before he can even touch me,
he'll drop unconscious!

1195
01:52:12,823 --> 01:52:13,881
Great!

1196
01:52:15,258 --> 01:52:20,218
Making the guards unconscious
will be my responsibility.

1197
01:52:21,331 --> 01:52:24,664
As soon as l get the signal...

1198
01:52:24,868 --> 01:52:27,530
l'll take out the knife...

1199
01:52:28,772 --> 01:52:30,535
hidden under the bed...

1200
01:52:35,445 --> 01:52:38,676
and cut Baadal's heart
into a million pieces.

1201
01:52:41,284 --> 01:52:48,554
And l'll place the knife in the
hands of an unconscious guard.

1202
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:52,385
Then l'll scream!

1203
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:57,496
Murder... Murder... Murder...

1204
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:03,268
The guards will be
accused of the murder!

1205
01:53:03,473 --> 01:53:08,206
And l'll be yours forever.

1206
01:53:10,947 --> 01:53:12,972
That's Bijlee's voice, right?

1207
01:53:15,285 --> 01:53:16,274
Why are you crying?

1208
01:53:16,486 --> 01:53:17,851
And why is she laughing?

1209
01:53:19,890 --> 01:53:23,519
You're like thunder in the sky,
you blow my fuse away!

1210
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,318
ls it an electrician?

1211
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:27,597
l didn't send him.

1212
01:53:31,601 --> 01:53:36,664
Then one day we'll get rid off
his evil mother...

1213
01:53:36,907 --> 01:53:40,809
and get our hands on her money...

1214
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:45,580
get married and sail the seven seas.

1215
01:53:45,882 --> 01:53:49,579
Sail the seven seas!

1216
01:53:50,253 --> 01:53:52,915
My Lady Macbeth, well done!

1217
01:53:54,791 --> 01:53:56,315
Bijlee, somebody will catch us.

1218
01:53:57,327 --> 01:54:01,593
Have mercy on me.
For gods' sake, let me go!

1219
01:54:01,798 --> 01:54:05,495
How can l ever leave you
even for the sake of god?

1220
01:54:21,284 --> 01:54:22,342
Thank you.

1221
01:55:14,905 --> 01:55:15,530
Bijlee!

1222
01:55:31,187 --> 01:55:31,812
Who's inside?

1223
01:55:34,758 --> 01:55:35,656
Nobody.

1224
01:55:40,497 --> 01:55:42,328
This 6 foot tall thug is nobody?

1225
01:55:43,533 --> 01:55:46,559
Oh... you're not Baadal?

1226
01:55:48,638 --> 01:55:49,866
What were you doing inside?

1227
01:55:50,774 --> 01:55:52,207
We were reading...
Shakespeare...

1228
01:55:53,777 --> 01:55:54,675
William.

1229
01:55:55,946 --> 01:55:57,311
ln the swimming pool?

1230
01:55:59,916 --> 01:56:01,611
l fixed the leaking tap...

1231
01:56:01,818 --> 01:56:03,649
until the pool could fill up...

1232
01:56:03,887 --> 01:56:07,618
we thought we'd try,
reading Shakespeare under water.

1233
01:56:09,859 --> 01:56:10,951
Shakespeare...

1234
01:56:15,765 --> 01:56:18,598
Bastard, do you think l'm a moron?

1235
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:27,604
ls it a crime to read
Shakespeare in this country?

1236
01:56:30,447 --> 01:56:32,677
Careful...

1237
01:56:38,154 --> 01:56:39,746
Matru is like a brother to me.

1238
01:56:41,257 --> 01:56:44,283
And if he says they were
reading Shakespeare...

1239
01:56:45,261 --> 01:56:48,697
then why don't you believe, that
they were just reading Shakespeare!

1240
01:56:52,335 --> 01:56:56,362
Who are you to doubt
my fiancee's intentions?

1241
01:56:59,275 --> 01:57:00,674
Her father.

1242
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:20,889
Once when you were a kid,
your mother spanked you a lot.

1243
01:57:24,401 --> 01:57:26,892
You were playing truant from school
to go for a movie.

1244
01:57:31,241 --> 01:57:33,835
l didn't talk to her
for months after that.

1245
01:57:38,748 --> 01:57:40,875
Now l think she was right
and l was wrong.

1246
01:57:43,787 --> 01:57:45,618
l think l should spank you.

1247
01:57:55,532 --> 01:57:57,693
Who am l dreaming
these dreams for?

1248
01:58:00,236 --> 01:58:02,602
This lifestyle... this wealth...

1249
01:58:04,808 --> 01:58:05,502
for whom?

1250
01:58:10,346 --> 01:58:11,711
For me.

1251
01:58:15,852 --> 01:58:19,253
Go get dressed.

1252
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:39,437
Matru...

1253
01:58:41,511 --> 01:58:42,637
Matru.

1254
01:58:42,912 --> 01:58:44,470
Are you an idiot or a coward?

1255
01:58:44,647 --> 01:58:45,511
Are you blind?

1256
01:58:45,682 --> 01:58:47,445
Or are you diseased?

1257
01:58:54,757 --> 01:58:56,622
l am Mao.

1258
01:59:32,729 --> 01:59:35,357
Look what l've found...

1259
01:59:36,799 --> 01:59:38,164
What is it?

1260
01:59:40,303 --> 01:59:42,134
See this!

1261
02:01:24,507 --> 02:01:26,634
Extend your right hand.

1262
02:02:42,251 --> 02:02:43,741
Please bring the bride.

1263
02:04:15,778 --> 02:04:17,473
Bijlee, are you ready?

1264
02:04:22,652 --> 02:04:23,619
Bijlee!

1265
02:04:31,661 --> 02:04:33,322
Bijlee, where are you?

1266
02:04:34,597 --> 02:04:35,791
Bijlee!

1267
02:04:52,648 --> 02:04:53,410
Bijlee!

1268
02:05:04,193 --> 02:05:04,522
Bijlee!

1269
02:05:07,630 --> 02:05:08,528
Bijlee!

1270
02:05:12,201 --> 02:05:12,599
Bijlee!

1271
02:05:22,912 --> 02:05:24,641
Daddy!

1272
02:05:26,282 --> 02:05:28,512
Cheers daddy!

1273
02:05:33,456 --> 02:05:35,481
l've been stuck in here for an hour...

1274
02:05:38,361 --> 02:05:39,760
Help me out, please.

1275
02:05:47,336 --> 02:05:49,861
Sorry...

1276
02:05:56,779 --> 02:05:58,508
What have you done?

1277
02:05:59,382 --> 02:05:59,780
What?

1278
02:06:02,251 --> 02:06:02,580
Oh!

1279
02:06:05,955 --> 02:06:07,252
The booze?

1280
02:06:13,529 --> 02:06:19,866
Now l know why you
love alcohol so much.

1281
02:06:21,671 --> 02:06:25,437
The truth doesn't seem so bitter
when you're drunk.

1282
02:06:26,609 --> 02:06:28,839
No pain... no sorrow...

1283
02:06:30,546 --> 02:06:33,276
lt's so much fun living a lie...

1284
02:06:34,784 --> 02:06:37,548
thanks to the booze.

1285
02:06:48,331 --> 02:06:49,423
Daddy...

1286
02:06:55,237 --> 02:07:02,769
You know, l even thought
of committing suicide...

1287
02:07:08,217 --> 02:07:11,880
then l thought
l might as well get married...

1288
02:07:12,521 --> 02:07:14,512
Same thing...

1289
02:07:19,895 --> 02:07:21,795
Never mind...

1290
02:07:33,542 --> 02:07:34,702
Let's go...

1291
02:07:41,884 --> 02:07:43,044
Thank you for coming.

1292
02:07:43,853 --> 02:07:46,845
Hello...

1293
02:07:49,358 --> 02:07:50,484
Oh... here...

1294
02:07:57,667 --> 02:07:58,691
Mom!

1295
02:08:05,274 --> 02:08:07,504
Hold this, please.

1296
02:08:07,576 --> 02:08:08,440
But...

1297
02:08:10,212 --> 02:08:15,844
Mom, your daughter-in-law is
so uncouth.

1298
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:18,619
So sorry l'm late!

1299
02:08:19,255 --> 02:08:20,813
- Where should l sit?
- Go there.

1300
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:22,113
There?

1301
02:08:22,324 --> 02:08:22,881
Sit here.

1302
02:08:23,592 --> 02:08:24,251
Shift.

1303
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:26,291
But where?

1304
02:08:26,495 --> 02:08:27,757
l'll sit here.

1305
02:08:37,873 --> 02:08:40,671
You look handsome tonight!

1306
02:08:46,916 --> 02:08:48,781
Pundit sir...

1307
02:08:50,219 --> 02:08:52,380
begin the chant or...

1308
02:08:52,655 --> 02:08:54,145
the factory inauguration--

1309
02:08:58,861 --> 02:08:59,828
Sorry!

1310
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:05,662
l mean the wedding will get delayed.
You bloody buffoon!

1311
02:09:08,571 --> 02:09:09,731
Get started, Pundit sir.

1312
02:10:11,801 --> 02:10:12,460
Hukum Singh!

1313
02:10:23,345 --> 02:10:25,939
Who put bottles of
liquor all over the house?

1314
02:10:27,850 --> 02:10:28,839
Mao did.

1315
02:10:31,187 --> 02:10:32,484
And who is Mao?

1316
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:34,913
l am.

1317
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:46,796
lf your Mao,
then l'm Veer Bhagat Singh!

1318
02:10:48,304 --> 02:10:50,568
lf you're a hammer,
then l'm a sickle.

1319
02:10:51,807 --> 02:10:56,904
God to the farmers, Mao.

1320
02:10:57,546 --> 02:11:01,448
l grovel at your feet
you bloody buffoon!

1321
02:11:03,352 --> 02:11:06,344
- Leave this one.
- Give it to me!

1322
02:11:06,622 --> 02:11:07,714
You can take one!

1323
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:08,979
Okay... this one.

1324
02:11:09,258 --> 02:11:09,656
No!

1325
02:11:11,493 --> 02:11:15,520
Take the one on your left,
you're Mao after all.

1326
02:11:19,368 --> 02:11:21,632
But why hide it from me?

1327
02:11:22,805 --> 02:11:25,831
Why didn't you tell me that
you're Mao?

1328
02:11:26,475 --> 02:11:27,737
l was...

1329
02:11:28,878 --> 02:11:31,438
waiting for diesel prices to
go up.

1330
02:11:34,183 --> 02:11:37,243
Even the radish has
shot through the roof.

1331
02:11:39,188 --> 02:11:41,656
Your aunt eloped with the watchman.

1332
02:11:41,724 --> 02:11:45,717
And my daughter is getting
married today.

1333
02:11:52,568 --> 02:11:55,435
But the minister has
not signed your file yet.

1334
02:12:15,457 --> 02:12:16,389
Hurry up.

1335
02:12:19,929 --> 02:12:20,827
Place the flowers...

1336
02:12:20,896 --> 02:12:22,488
Please stand for the seven steps.

1337
02:12:22,831 --> 02:12:23,559
Yes, okay...

1338
02:12:24,566 --> 02:12:28,195
Bijlee... wake up!

1339
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:29,168
The steps.

1340
02:12:29,238 --> 02:12:29,829
What?

1341
02:12:29,939 --> 02:12:31,167
lt's the time for the seven steps!

1342
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:32,604
Take the flowers.

1343
02:12:32,675 --> 02:12:34,336
Get up.

1344
02:12:34,910 --> 02:12:36,571
- Get up?
- Yes.

1345
02:12:36,645 --> 02:12:37,509
Help me.

1346
02:12:39,715 --> 02:12:40,647
Careful!

1347
02:12:44,687 --> 02:12:46,712
Not that way...

1348
02:12:47,256 --> 02:12:48,450
Why didn't you say so.

1349
02:12:48,524 --> 02:12:50,389
- Sorry.
- Let's start.

1350
02:13:03,272 --> 02:13:03,795
Look sweets!

1351
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:05,703
No no... don't do that!

1352
02:13:09,278 --> 02:13:12,338
Stop right there.
You bloody buffoon!

1353
02:13:14,216 --> 02:13:15,808
Daddy!

1354
02:13:30,432 --> 02:13:33,230
Stop it!
You bloody buffoon!

1355
02:13:33,602 --> 02:13:34,330
Daddy...

1356
02:13:36,405 --> 02:13:37,235
My darling...

1357
02:13:37,306 --> 02:13:38,330
Bless me...

1358
02:13:40,743 --> 02:13:42,643
How many steps are complete?

1359
02:13:42,711 --> 02:13:45,305
Only four.

1360
02:13:46,181 --> 02:13:49,617
That was close...
you bloody buffoon!

1361
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:53,950
Anyway, better late than never.

1362
02:13:54,223 --> 02:13:56,350
What happened Mr. Mandola?

1363
02:13:59,228 --> 02:14:03,688
That which shouldn't have happened.

1364
02:14:06,335 --> 02:14:09,736
Gulabbo in... Harry out.

1365
02:14:12,574 --> 02:14:13,836
Just a minute!

1366
02:14:18,647 --> 02:14:21,548
First you sign the file...

1367
02:14:22,751 --> 02:14:24,878
then we move ahead.
Bloody buffoon!

1368
02:14:30,626 --> 02:14:31,285
Are these real?

1369
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:32,292
Yes!

1370
02:14:33,829 --> 02:14:34,591
Mom!

1371
02:14:36,198 --> 02:14:37,165
Pen.

1372
02:14:39,168 --> 02:14:41,329
You look hot!

1373
02:14:55,818 --> 02:14:57,786
What are you doing, Mr. Mandola?

1374
02:14:58,554 --> 02:14:59,748
l'm playing

1375
02:14:59,822 --> 02:15:02,256
People-Politician!
Politician-People!

1376
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:06,793
Alright, give me my pen back.

1377
02:15:07,329 --> 02:15:07,886
Stop it!

1378
02:15:08,931 --> 02:15:10,421
Stop it, Mr. Mandola!

1379
02:15:10,766 --> 02:15:12,893
People-Politician!
Politician-People!

1380
02:15:16,438 --> 02:15:19,339
That is cops and robbers,
not People-Politician.

1381
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:21,503
Cops and robbers...

1382
02:15:21,643 --> 02:15:24,578
For the amusement of all gathered here

1383
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:28,374
This is the tale of a crook

1384
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:30,350
Lend me your ears

1385
02:15:30,419 --> 02:15:35,857
Here's how it goes

1386
02:15:37,226 --> 02:15:40,423
Politicians of all hues,
use all their might

1387
02:15:40,496 --> 02:15:43,795
Walk all over the peasants,
pocketing everything in sight

1388
02:15:49,304 --> 02:15:50,703
Sports scams and rail scams

1389
02:15:50,772 --> 02:15:53,866
Cops and ministers, hand in glove
Laughing all the way to the bank

1390
02:15:53,909 --> 02:15:57,174
Telecom, airwaves, 3G,
how hard it all sank

1391
02:15:57,246 --> 02:15:58,440
That's how it goes

1392
02:15:58,514 --> 02:15:59,811
The tale of a crook

1393
02:15:59,882 --> 02:16:01,440
The swindles and the scams

1394
02:16:01,517 --> 02:16:02,950
Oh how badly it stank

1395
02:16:29,278 --> 02:16:30,438
Madam...

1396
02:16:33,615 --> 02:16:36,641
Mr. Mandola.
You are under arrest.

1397
02:16:39,388 --> 02:16:40,514
Come here you jerk!

1398
02:16:40,789 --> 02:16:41,813
Now!

1399
02:16:46,595 --> 02:16:48,927
What do you mean under arrest?

1400
02:16:49,198 --> 02:16:51,462
Section 290 clause 510...

1401
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:55,161
consuming alcohol on a dry day
and creating nuisance in public.

1402
02:16:55,904 --> 02:16:56,802
He is right.

1403
02:16:58,440 --> 02:17:00,169
You sellouts!

1404
02:17:02,878 --> 02:17:04,903
Leave him.

1405
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:07,273
Let him go.

1406
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:10,682
Daddy...

1407
02:17:17,492 --> 02:17:19,585
You've shown your true colours,
finally.

1408
02:17:34,843 --> 02:17:37,710
There are only three steps left,
complete them properly.

1409
02:17:39,281 --> 02:17:40,578
l don't want to get married.

1410
02:17:41,516 --> 02:17:44,610
You are drunk right now.

1411
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:48,218
You can't decide what's
right or wrong.

1412
02:17:49,625 --> 02:17:50,922
Like your father!

1413
02:17:51,226 --> 02:17:51,851
Daddy!

1414
02:17:55,330 --> 02:17:56,661
You better listen...

1415
02:17:56,732 --> 02:18:01,192
Or else your kids will laugh
when they see your wedding video...

1416
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:05,502
Oh! Mom got married in handcuffs.

1417
02:18:07,276 --> 02:18:08,402
Come dear.

1418
02:18:08,777 --> 02:18:14,716
Your tyranny
We'll no longer heed

1419
02:18:24,793 --> 02:18:27,421
Our protest

1420
02:18:29,898 --> 02:18:32,230
We'll no longer cede

1421
02:18:43,412 --> 02:18:46,279
Your tyranny

1422
02:18:46,348 --> 02:18:48,578
We'll no longer heed

1423
02:18:48,850 --> 02:18:51,546
Our protest

1424
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:53,349
We'll no longer cede

1425
02:18:54,423 --> 02:18:56,857
Your arms and sticks
will no longer work

1426
02:18:56,925 --> 02:18:59,621
Your bullying and hectoring
will no longer work

1427
02:18:59,695 --> 02:19:02,323
Your arms and sticks
will no longer work

1428
02:19:02,397 --> 02:19:04,865
Your bullying and hectoring
will no longer work

1429
02:19:04,933 --> 02:19:07,231
Let hammers bang

1430
02:19:07,302 --> 02:19:10,396
Hammers, Hammers,
Let sickles clang

1431
02:19:10,472 --> 02:19:12,303
Plunderer, Out! Out!

1432
02:19:12,908 --> 02:19:14,671
Plunderer, Out! Out!

1433
02:19:21,483 --> 02:19:25,715
He who tills must own the soil

1434
02:19:31,593 --> 02:19:35,620
No big shot can force his wishes

1435
02:19:37,599 --> 02:19:39,567
lf the sugarcane's mine
so are its pieces

1436
02:19:39,634 --> 02:19:42,467
Plunderer, Out! Out!

1437
02:19:42,504 --> 02:19:44,495
Plunderer, Out! Out!

1438
02:19:48,643 --> 02:19:51,441
The consequences of this will be dire,
Harphool Singh Mandola!

1439
02:19:51,513 --> 02:19:53,481
You have no clue who
you're messing with...

1440
02:19:53,548 --> 02:19:55,277
l'll make sure you rot in jail!

1441
02:19:56,785 --> 02:20:01,745
Once you're sober you'll come to me
like a sad little puppy.

1442
02:20:03,492 --> 02:20:06,222
Get lost, you jerks!

1443
02:20:10,532 --> 02:20:13,194
You scoundrels!

1444
02:20:15,904 --> 02:20:18,464
You called me a sad little puppy?

1445
02:20:37,392 --> 02:20:38,256
Daddy!

1446
02:20:43,565 --> 02:20:45,658
l am such a bad father...

1447
02:20:46,935 --> 02:20:49,597
l was about to get you married
to a beast.

1448
02:20:55,277 --> 02:20:56,608
Forgive me, my darling.

1449
02:20:58,513 --> 02:21:00,981
Now l'll get you married
to a human being.

1450
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:02,348
Come.

1451
02:21:02,984 --> 02:21:03,643
Who?

1452
02:21:04,453 --> 02:21:05,943
Who else but you.

1453
02:21:06,221 --> 02:21:08,280
Where is that Pundit?

1454
02:21:08,356 --> 02:21:09,880
l'm not a human being...

1455
02:21:12,561 --> 02:21:13,755
l'm a servant.

1456
02:21:16,798 --> 02:21:17,890
So what...

1457
02:21:24,272 --> 02:21:27,400
l wanted to be a servant's wife,
since my childhood.

1458
02:21:28,710 --> 02:21:30,769
You fool,
you can't marry a servant!

1459
02:21:31,813 --> 02:21:32,507
Why not?

1460
02:21:32,914 --> 02:21:35,382
Does a servant's wife
have three udders?

1461
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:36,712
Or four?

1462
02:21:43,592 --> 02:21:46,459
This man, your father.

1463
02:21:47,762 --> 02:21:50,390
He'll have us both
killed tomorrow morning.

1464
02:21:50,565 --> 02:21:51,463
You get it?

1465
02:21:52,234 --> 02:21:54,828
And why would l do that?

1466
02:21:55,637 --> 02:21:57,366
Because you're drunk right now.

1467
02:21:59,508 --> 02:22:01,635
Remember what l said?

1468
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:05,437
l'm not really who l seem to be.

1469
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,488
