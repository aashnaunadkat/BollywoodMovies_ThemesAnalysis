1
00:02:57,593 --> 00:03:01,873
Vidhi!
- Brother, are you recording me?

2
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,193
Now this video will go to mom.

3
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,286
Mom..

4
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:25,686
Brother.. I'll also
tell dad you use his razor.

5
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,846
Dad.. Catch brother.

6
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:39,206
Catch brother.
- I've caught him.

7
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,406
I've caught him..

8
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,406
Let go, Dad.
Dad, let go.

9
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:46,486
Mom, you have to see
what Vidhi did.

10
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:00,886
Is it mom's?
- No..

11
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:02,006
Then..

12
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:05,366
Everyone uses their mom's
lipstick in the hostel.

13
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:08,286
But honestly, I've never done it.

14
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,566
N-now close your eyes.

15
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,378
What's going on?
What've you done, Vidhi?

16
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:29,333
Give mom's lipstick, come.

17
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:32,133
Where did you get it from?

18
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,093
Go to your room
and brush your teeth.

19
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:41,213
Dad, don't remove it.
You look so pretty.

20
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:42,813
Thank you.

21
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:50,933
Did you talk to Shivam?

22
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:58,053
What's the point of dealing it?
We have decided it anyway.

23
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:02,585
Nitin, don't tell me
you can't do it.

24
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:04,227
No.. I can do it.

25
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,745
Nitin, I'm talking to you.
Nitin!

26
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:20,444
Don't you think this is important?

27
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:24,124
Nitin!

28
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:31,604
Fine. Just remember
it's all because of you.

29
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,132
You hard dark moustaches.

30
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,921
Everyone in hostel says,
the more you shave

31
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:19,361
the better your moustaches.

32
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,441
Isn't this a college photograph?

33
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,090
Yes, final year
if I remember right.

34
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:29,954
Was this before proposing to mom?

35
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,307
No.. After that.

36
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:36,298
Mom was saying that you..
- I thought I'll come with you.

37
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:38,898
Where?
- Manali.

38
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:41,458
Manali!
- No, hostel.

39
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:44,987
But, I'm going to hostel
with my friends.

40
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,418
And I'll be bored with you.

41
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,098
You too will be bored with me.

42
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,658
Why bored?
It'll be a nice drive.

43
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:55,178
And you can direct me
by looking at the map on the phone.

44
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:56,971
Okay.

45
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:11,298
Where are you going, Nitin?
- With Shivam.

46
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:15,938
With his friends?
No, just Shivam and I.

47
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,538
I have a feeling
he'll tell Shivam today.

48
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:31,218
Am I patient?
I've always been patient with him.

49
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,938
I sometimes feel it's been
so many years

50
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:36,618
I still haven't been
able to figure him out.

51
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:48,178
Let's see what happens.

52
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,378
Vidhi! You've not finished
your milk yet!

53
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:54,538
Mom, I want chocolate.

54
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:58,178
Yes, the same route.
But my dad wants to come with me.

55
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:01,298
'Hmm, Daddy's boy!'
- Shut up!

56
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:03,018
You sissy! Mom's boy!

57
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:04,178
'When will you meet me?'

58
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:05,708
Yes, I'm meeting you
in the evening.

59
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:08,468
'Then you'll meet Natasha too.'

60
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,268
Don't irritate me.
Listen, did someone complain?

61
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:16,308
'Did anyone find
our magazine bunch?'

62
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,748
Are you crazy?
- 'Then it must be Shubh.'

63
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:21,628
'The fat guy.'
- Yes!

64
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:23,708
He takes advantage
of being a senior.

65
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:26,628
Shivam!
- I'm coming, Dad.

66
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,268
Okay, bye, pal.
- 'Okay, bye.'

67
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:31,748
I'll meet you in school.
Okay, bye.

68
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,148
Yes!

69
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:30,668
Are we on the right track?

70
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:36,628
Yes. Google Maps says
we're on the right track.

71
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:40,268
Six to seven more hours.
- Yes.

72
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,348
When is the IPL beginning?
- IPL? Next week.

73
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:54,948
Can you watch TV in the hostel?

74
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:58,652
TV? We watch it
on the mobile phone.

75
00:09:58,892 --> 00:09:59,852
Who needs TV?

76
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,012
You know the cricketer

77
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:19,972
Steven Davis.
- What happened to him?

78
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:22,264
Someone was saying

79
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:25,852
that actually

80
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,452
he's..

81
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:40,452
he's playing well.

82
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,012
Do they show you movies
on Saturdays?

83
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:10,572
Only classics.
Boring black and white.

84
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:20,492
Which game are you playing?
- Clash of Clans.

85
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:26,892
We used to play Donkey Kong.
- Never heard of it.

86
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:28,612
Oh, no!

87
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:35,812
Come..
Yes.. Come..

88
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:36,812
Carefully.

89
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,911
Stop. Yes.

90
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,390
Is it good?
- Yes.

91
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,230
Dad.. - Yes.

92
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:06,083
That's him.

93
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:11,883
Who?
- Aditya Taneja.

94
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:14,158
Is he a friend of yours?

95
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,678
Do one thing, pal.
Your boss, the transporter..

96
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,673
What does he do?
- He's a celebrity, Dad.

97
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:22,233
Do you know how much money
did he make?

98
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:24,713
He has two girlfriends
on two different shows.

99
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:28,073
And he dumped them both on TV.
- How do you know all this?

100
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:30,593
General knowledge is my strength.
Wait a second.

101
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:36,953
What happened?
- Aditya Taneja. Please see this.

102
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:41,073
Is he a model?
- He's not a model.

103
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:42,713
Is he the actor-type?

104
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:45,513
No. He's a TV
reality show winner.

105
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:46,753
He's a TV celebrity.

106
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:52,953
Are reality shows a full-time job?
- Do you have a pen and paper?

107
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:54,913
Pen..

108
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:56,993
No.

109
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,153
Excuse me, do you have a pen
and paper?

110
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:07,913
Aditya, Hi!

111
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,553
Hi! - Can I have your autograph?
- Yes.

112
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:15,953
Sure.
What's your name?

113
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:17,833
Shivam.
- Shivam, right.

114
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:32,113
Isn't he so cool?

115
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:37,433
Shivam, I've to talk
to you about something.

116
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:42,313
Hey, Shiva! Is that your dad?

117
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:45,273
Say 'Hi' to him.

118
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:01,513
Dad, would it be okay if my friend
came with us to Mussoorie?

119
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,433
Which friend?
T-that boy?

120
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:07,913
I offered the ride.

121
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:10,433
How can a complete stranger
come along with us?

122
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:12,953
But he's not a stranger.
The whole nation knows him.

123
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:16,473
If he's such a big celebrity,
where's his car?

124
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,073
How do I know, Dad?
Please let him come.

125
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:21,913
Shivam, please try and understand.

126
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:23,873
I'm driving you
to school for a reason.

127
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:28,793
I've to talk to you.
Come. Come and sit in the car.

128
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,793
You always have your way.

129
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,073
We'll go to grandma's.

130
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:46,993
After meeting her,
we'll go forward.

131
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:50,313
Okay?

132
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:10,553
Oh, no! I lost my missile.

133
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,273
There are cheat codes in all these.

134
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,993
Do you know about cheat codes?

135
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,193
Yes, of course.

136
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,699
How?

137
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,153
Did they exist during your days?

138
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:25,553
Are you really asking that?

139
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,753
Dear, we invented them.

140
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:31,473
What do you mean?

141
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,073
I mean..

142
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:35,461
I know people
who wrote these codes.

143
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,298
Where are your friends now?

144
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:38,785
In the US?

145
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,600
And how did they do all this?

146
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,560
Darn! We forgot our seat belts.

147
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't tell mom.
She is wild.

148
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
Just wait I'll tell you.

149
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:48,023
In those days
we didn't have the internet.

150
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,223
So we couldn't download
the cheat codes.

151
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,183
So we used to write it.

152
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:54,663
And then we used to store it
in floppy's

153
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,143
and share it with each other.

154
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,583
Do you know about floppy disk?

155
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,863
Floppy's.
- Floppy's!

156
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:02,863
Dad, how old are you?
100!

157
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:19,871
Grandma.

158
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:22,528
Grandma.

159
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,928
My child is here!

160
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,179
Let me see.

161
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,259
They don't give you food
in your hostel.

162
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:33,253
You have lost weight.

163
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:35,404
And why did you come
after so many days?

164
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:36,884
Don't you miss your grandma?

165
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:38,564
I keep telling dad.
He doesn't get me.

166
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:41,204
Really!
Come we will talk to him.

167
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:44,247
Greetings, Mom.
- Greetings, my dear.

168
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,158
It took you so long
to reach here.

169
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,078
Your dad and I have been
waiting for a while.

170
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,008
Come.
Come inside.

171
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:51,928
Get the luggage.

172
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,884
No, Mom.
We are leaving now.

173
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,196
I have to drop Shivam
to the hostel.

174
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,575
At least have food and go.
- Yes.

175
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:57,903
Let's go, dear.

176
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:00,783
What did you all tell Vidhi
and come?

177
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,863
From morning I called
nearly five to six times.

178
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,743
Why didn't they come till now?

179
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:08,703
When will they come? And then
I hope you're not lying to me.

180
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:11,583
Now why will I lie
in this old age?

181
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:13,823
Come.

182
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:17,306
Mom just left
leaving you this way.

183
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:27,186
Dad, I can't believe this.
You're still using this razor.

184
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,626
I remembered my childhood.

185
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,906
When I used to use it
stealing it from you.

186
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:41,306
Now Shivam does it with me.

187
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:57,017
Dad.

188
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:02,080
I always wanted to tell you
something about myself.

189
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,457
But I did not have courage.

190
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,310
Whenever I had courage

191
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,510
I stopped myself
for some or the other reason.

192
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:24,713
Today I initiated this talk
not

193
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,166
because you cannot talk.

194
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,150
It's time for me to say it.

195
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,150
I was never attracted to women.

196
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,790
I am gay.

197
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:33,036
I just thought I'll tell you that.

198
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:55,956
Do you remember
when you hit me once?

199
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:05,396
You saw me cry
and gave me a hug.

200
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:15,876
I didn't want to loose
that feeling ever.

201
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:23,036
Sorry, dad
if I have disappointed you.

202
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:36,443
I just want to tell you that..

203
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:58,603
Shivam, I..

204
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:01,563
I was about to tell you.

205
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,963
I didn't want you to know
this way.

206
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,047
That's the reason
I came along with you.

207
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,327
I had thought Sunita
all the good habits.

208
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,287
And she got married.

209
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:54,807
Now I need to teach everything
to this new girl.

210
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:59,367
If salt is less do take it.

211
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,607
You're not eating anything!

212
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:02,927
There is mango pickle.

213
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:04,887
There is sweet chutney as well.

214
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:06,887
Sambar.
- Yes, Sambar.

215
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,767
You will like the Sambar.

216
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:13,127
What happened, dear?
You're not eating anything.

217
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:14,967
When you get back to hostel
you will remember

218
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:17,127
how tasty was grandma's food.

219
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:21,247
If you would stay for some
more time, he would feel better.

220
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:24,064
You all come to Delhi.

221
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:25,586
It's done now.

222
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:29,146
In this old age in such a
big city, noise all over

223
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:30,586
how will we feel comfortable?

224
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,546
And you are aware
about your dad's health.

225
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:34,466
All the doctors have gone
to the hospital.

226
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,266
No, we are fine here.

227
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,766
Were you happy with dad?

228
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:53,046
I will tell you the truth.

229
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:56,246
Who thinks about all this
in the old age?

230
00:23:56,943 --> 00:24:00,423
Your dad and I used to fight
over silly matters.

231
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,019
And now after coming here
we don't remember anything.

232
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:09,059
Now I just fear about one thing.

233
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:14,419
Loneliness? - No,
my knees and your dad's weight.

234
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:17,939
If something happens to him
how will I carry him?

235
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,259
So you think this about dad?

236
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,179
And his favourite yoga.

237
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,379
'Pawanmuktasan.'

238
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,459
That's the only voice
which comes out from him.

239
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,699
I get satisfied that
he at least says something.

240
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:37,739
When he leaves there won't
be any sort of noise here.

241
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:39,859
Just think.

242
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:43,939
When I was young who knew that
I will crave for someone's fart.

243
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:49,179
You should always do the things
which makes you happy.

244
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:56,699
What happened to him?

245
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,059
He was so happy when he came.

246
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:04,459
Nothing.

247
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:07,499
His holidays are coming
to an end.

248
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,419
Maybe that's the reason.

249
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:25,219
Stay blessed, dear.

250
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,643
Come soon.

251
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:42,283
Mom give a thought
about coming to Delhi.

252
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:43,763
Water.

253
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:45,203
What?

254
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:48,123
Water.

255
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:07,363
One bottle of water.

256
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:18,363
Here.

257
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:48,803
Shivam,
that's a celebrity right?

258
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,803
Yes.

259
00:28:00,683 --> 00:28:01,839
Hey, man!
- Hey.

260
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:02,973
How are you?
- I am good.

261
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:05,723
Sorry, man. I didn't mean
to stop your car.

262
00:28:05,763 --> 00:28:07,763
No problem. Mussoorie, right?
- Yes.

263
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:09,403
Get in.
- Really!

264
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:11,723
Thanks.

265
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,003
Thanks, man.

266
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:46,443
Shivam speaks highly of you.

267
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,483
But I couldn't recognise
you in the beginning.

268
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:51,123
It's all right.

269
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:54,083
Anyway, my shows are not meant
for your generation.

270
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:57,723
Sorry.
But that's the truth.

271
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,123
Actually this show
was of that kind.

272
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:02,433
But this time
I won't be able to stand myself.

273
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:04,393
That's the reason I escaped
from there.

274
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,113
Production also has no clue
of when I would return.

275
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:09,684
Why?
Why are you running?

276
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:11,484
You could do it.

277
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:15,444
The truth is that
I am tired of the same things.

278
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:18,364
Now it's too much. I can't do it.

279
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:21,724
Now I want to know
what my life is all about.

280
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:24,644
What I want to do..

281
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:28,684
What is the purpose
of my existence.

282
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,884
Therefore, I didn't bring
my phone with me this time.

283
00:29:36,924 --> 00:29:38,284
Wow!

284
00:29:38,324 --> 00:29:39,324
Stop! Stop! Please!

285
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,684
I really need to capture this.

286
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,124
I really need to get this man!

287
00:29:53,844 --> 00:29:56,684
Shivam, I just..
I wanted to..

288
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:40,231
And what about mom?

289
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:43,471
We are getting a divorce.

290
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:46,031
Divorce!

291
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:49,071
And no one informed
me anything till now.

292
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:52,031
That's why I am with you.

293
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:55,991
And what about Vidhi?

294
00:30:57,427 --> 00:30:59,107
She's too young.
What will she understand?

295
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:04,091
I and your mom
will handle her.

296
00:31:56,971 --> 00:31:58,571
Arun and his friends are nearby.

297
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,731
I will join them in their car.

298
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,051
They also have an extra seat.

299
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:03,691
Won't you come with me?

300
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:06,632
You have already
spoken to me.

301
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:09,032
Now there's no point
coming so far.

302
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:10,192
It's okay.

303
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:13,792
They are letting me to know
where to meet them.

304
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:15,592
They will call me in sometime.

305
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,352
Hello! - 'Hello!'
- Yes, Arun. Tell me.

306
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:45,072
'Where are you?'
- There was network problem.

307
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:46,952
Where are you people?

308
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:49,192
A landslide occurred here.
All the roads are closed.

309
00:32:49,432 --> 00:32:51,072
We are standing here,
in middle of the street.

310
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,152
A little ahead.

311
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,152
Oh! Okay, fine.

312
00:32:57,152 --> 00:32:59,192
I will see you there.
Okay then, bye.

313
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:00,872
What happened?

314
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,472
The road has been
blocked due to landslide.

315
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,672
They are on the road.
It's few miles ahead.

316
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:09,392
Landslide!
- Yes.

317
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:34,352
I have reached at the bridge.

318
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:38,792
Okay.
Please stop the car..

319
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:42,912
Yes. Two minutes.

320
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,072
Yes, I see you guys.

321
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:50,712
Okay, bye.

322
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,432
You stay here.
I will meet them and come back.

323
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:00,392
How are you?

324
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,152
How were your holidays?
- It was really good.

325
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:05,112
How was yours?
- It was awesome.

326
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:07,752
What happened? How long will
it take to clear the roads?

327
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:10,472
Only God knows!
It was a landslide.

328
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:13,712
According to me it will
take minimum 12 to 15 hours.

329
00:34:13,912 --> 00:34:14,952
12-15 hours!

330
00:34:15,192 --> 00:34:16,352
It will take the whole night.

331
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:18,352
There are few lodges in Sinhola.

332
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:20,312
Many people are
going there today.

333
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,232
Okay, I'll get my bag.
- Okay! - Sure!

334
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,912
I want to talk to her
just once.

335
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,192
The roads will remain closed
till tomorrow morning.

336
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,792
We will have to stay
somewhere nearby today.

337
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:46,312
What happened?

338
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:52,672
Nothing.
I'm going to stay with my friends.

339
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:57,072
Let's just find a place
to stay for tonight.

340
00:34:58,272 --> 00:35:00,072
After that you can
go with your friends.

341
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:02,152
And I will return
back to Delhi.

342
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,832
Hey! What happened to him?

343
00:35:22,992 --> 00:35:25,152
We need three rooms.
Two of us..

344
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:30,152
That's true.

345
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:34,112
Okay. See you in the room.

346
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:42,912
Hey, guys.

347
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,032
Here's your room key.
- Thank you, sir.

348
00:35:45,232 --> 00:35:46,152
That one, right here.

349
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:47,832
Tell your driver to unload
the luggage.

350
00:35:47,952 --> 00:35:49,152
Maybe you can go for dinner
dinner and come back.

351
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:51,512
See you around!

352
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,032
What happened?

353
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,272
I don't want you to stay here.

354
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:02,712
I will leave in the morning.

355
00:36:15,512 --> 00:36:16,552
Only three!

356
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:18,992
What are you saying?
There are total seven, for sure.

357
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:22,952
Just see her!
- Oh, heck! Ten!

358
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:24,922
She's just okay.

359
00:36:25,242 --> 00:36:27,402
What?
- Are you sure..

360
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:29,642
You just want things
like this only.

361
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:32,482
I won't leave you.
I will see.

362
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:42,882
I'll get that.

363
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,562
Hey! What's up!

364
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:01,922
What happened?
Should I leave?

365
00:37:02,442 --> 00:37:03,922
You want to stay with Aditya?

366
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,722
Sorry,
can you give us a minute.

367
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:11,402
Sure!

368
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:16,842
You're misbehaving
since morning.

369
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:18,602
I'm not going to tolerate this.

370
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:20,122
Then why are you
staying with him?

371
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,362
What's wrong with you?
Only two rooms were available.

372
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:23,855
And you went with your friends.

373
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:25,535
Do I even know this guy?

374
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:27,695
You were after me
to bring him here.

375
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:29,895
I understand everything.
I am not a kid.

376
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:32,175
Okay, whatever you're
thinking that is right?

377
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:35,775
I knew it.
- Superb, now leave.

378
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:36,815
And send Aditya inside.

379
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:03,535
Shi..
Have you seen Shivam?

380
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,855
Hey, Shivam!

381
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:42,295
Shivam!
Stop the car.

382
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:47,735
No!

383
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:53,735
Shivam, stop!

384
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:57,215
Shivam!

385
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,815
Shivam,
what are you doing?

386
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,735
What is this stupidity!
Are you out of your mind?

387
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:10,655
What are you doing?
What have I done to you?

388
00:39:10,855 --> 00:39:12,295
Did you ever think about us?

389
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,695
That's why you
sent me to hostel.

390
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,015
Far from everyone.

391
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,712
Did you ever ask me whether
I want to go or not?

392
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:20,208
You are also leaving mom alone.

393
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:21,888
She used to tell me
that you're the best.

394
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,368
What will I explain to Vidhi?

395
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,608
What will I tell her?

396
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:27,848
I feel ashamed to address
as my dad.

397
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:30,088
I feel weird even
standing nearby you.

398
00:39:30,488 --> 00:39:32,208
Even grandpa must
be ashamed of you.

399
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:33,888
It does not matter
if he is dumb.

400
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:35,163
This is who I am!

401
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:37,203
I can't change myself.

402
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,698
Do you think it's easy for me?

403
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,200
I can't live like that.

404
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:45,043
If you and Vidhi were not there

405
00:39:46,243 --> 00:39:47,963
I would have killed
myself a long time ago.

406
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:50,261
You know what!
You should have!

407
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:57,621
Pal, tell me something.

408
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,888
One tends to be gay
in childhood itself

409
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:03,928
or you turn into one
after you grow up?

410
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:07,368
Pal, then what will happen
to Natasha?

411
00:41:08,848 --> 00:41:10,048
I am not talking about myself.

412
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:14,848
Forget it.
- Tell me!

413
00:41:16,168 --> 00:41:17,408
Let it be, pal.
Maybe, some other time.

414
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:19,448
Pal, I won't tell anyone.
I swear!

415
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:22,888
Let it be, pal.

416
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:48,168
What happened, pal?

417
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:52,848
Nothing much.

418
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:58,372
I am gay.
- What?

419
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:01,532
Stop kidding, pal.
- You heard me.

420
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:08,160
Holy crap!

421
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,930
It's cold here.

422
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:31,446
Why are you getting scared?

423
00:42:33,806 --> 00:42:34,766
What will I do?

424
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:43,406
What will you do if a girl tells
you that she likes you?

425
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:48,326
If you don't like her,
you'll turn her down, right?

426
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:50,326
It's simple, right?

427
00:42:51,806 --> 00:42:53,126
You won't get scared like this.
Will you?

428
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,397
What is the need to get
scared about it?

429
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:02,117
By the way, you're not my type.

430
00:43:03,598 --> 00:43:06,278
I don't find you attractive.
- What?

431
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:09,238
Did you get offended?

432
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,198
You want me
to find you attractive? - No.

433
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:19,278
Don't worry.
You are safe.

434
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:24,238
But, Nitin, you are married.
You got kids.

435
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:28,638
Does Shivam know about this?
- Yes.

436
00:43:30,278 --> 00:43:31,278
I just told him today.

437
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:35,558
He has not taken it well.

438
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:38,838
Darn it!

439
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:54,139
What are you blabbering?
Did he tell you all this?

440
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,270
What will happen
to your mom, pal?

441
00:44:00,964 --> 00:44:03,284
I am not feeling sad
about whatever happened today.

442
00:44:03,995 --> 00:44:06,155
But I can't see
my family fall apart.

443
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,035
I just need my childhood
family back.

444
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:13,522
Being gay and so on..
I don't need it.

445
00:44:13,642 --> 00:44:14,682
Don't worry, pal.

446
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:16,282
Often, it turns out
to be a disease.

447
00:44:16,842 --> 00:44:18,402
It's not.
I googled it.

448
00:44:24,082 --> 00:44:25,642
Hey, give me your
telecommunication device.

449
00:44:25,722 --> 00:44:26,962
Hurry up.
- What did you ask for?

450
00:44:27,162 --> 00:44:28,082
Give me your phone.

451
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,722
Pal, please don't share this
with anyone.

452
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:34,363
Do you want your dad to be a man?
Then let me have it.

453
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:42,805
Look here.

454
00:44:45,965 --> 00:44:49,325
Baba Bengali.
- What about him?

455
00:44:53,765 --> 00:44:55,965
Have you lost it?
All this is nonsense!

456
00:44:56,165 --> 00:44:59,565
Let's not get into all this.
- Your dad will bring a stepdad.

457
00:44:59,685 --> 00:45:00,685
Let's rush before that.

458
00:45:01,005 --> 00:45:03,445
Pal, I told you all this because
I had to get it out of me

459
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:05,645
and because you
are my best friend.

460
00:45:07,725 --> 00:45:09,485
Don't irritate me.
Let's go.

461
00:45:14,085 --> 00:45:17,005
Go, pal.. Come on, go.
- Are you out of your mind?

462
00:45:17,165 --> 00:45:19,565
He'll scold me and chase me away.
- He won't.

463
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:21,125
Look at his face.

464
00:45:22,445 --> 00:45:24,165
Pal, I am telling you
he's the sage's follower.

465
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:25,805
Come on, pal.
Go now.

466
00:45:25,885 --> 00:45:27,325
I said, go!
Go!

467
00:45:29,365 --> 00:45:30,165
Sir.

468
00:45:32,293 --> 00:45:34,493
Yes, dear.
How can I help you?

469
00:45:35,323 --> 00:45:36,563
I..

470
00:45:36,723 --> 00:45:38,923
Where can I find
the bottled water?

471
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:41,203
Go to your room.
I'll have it sent right away.

472
00:45:46,523 --> 00:45:48,803
Come on, pal!
Come with me.

473
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:50,483
Let me show you.
Come on.

474
00:45:50,723 --> 00:45:53,003
"Twelve months.."
- Mister.

475
00:45:55,443 --> 00:45:56,603
I'll have it sent right away.

476
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,763
Pal, how do you know
about Baba Bengali?

477
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,243
Everyone knows about him.
Even at school.

478
00:46:28,323 --> 00:46:29,963
You are the only one
who doesn't know.

479
00:46:30,683 --> 00:46:34,283
Where there is a will,
there is a way, dear.

480
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:38,883
Like what? - Did you notice the
tattoo on the receptionist's hand?

481
00:46:42,923 --> 00:46:44,803
Yes. - Did you?
- Yes.

482
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:47,403
That is the mark of Baba Bengali.

483
00:46:48,363 --> 00:46:51,403
Pal, all that is fine.
But what if that receptionist

484
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:53,243
informs my dad about it?

485
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:56,163
He won't, pal.
It's a secret society.

486
00:46:56,283 --> 00:46:57,283
And hereafter, even you..

487
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:12,883
Come with me.

488
00:48:21,403 --> 00:48:22,243
Shivam.

489
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:38,283
We begin the herbal treatment
from where allopathic doctors

490
00:48:39,043 --> 00:48:41,963
quit their treatment.

491
00:48:42,123 --> 00:48:44,603
There are three ways
to have a healthy body.

492
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:48,203
'Vata', 'Pitta', and 'Kapha'.

493
00:48:48,683 --> 00:48:51,083
Consume the herbal medicine
and remember it.

494
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:54,403
Tell me your problem.

495
00:48:55,763 --> 00:48:56,883
Well, suppose I suffer a headache.

496
00:48:58,363 --> 00:49:00,523
Suppose someone suffers
from a stomach ache!

497
00:49:00,723 --> 00:49:02,523
Yes.
- Even a toothache.

498
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:06,043
And..
Suppose one feels cold?

499
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:10,447
Gooseberry is the key to health.

500
00:49:14,378 --> 00:49:16,058
And suppose someone

501
00:49:17,098 --> 00:49:20,098
is gay?
- Gay.

502
00:49:23,078 --> 00:49:27,358
Being homosexual.
It's a very dangerous disease.

503
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,035
Dangerous than AIDS.

504
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,440
It pollutes the culture,
body, and mind.

505
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,120
It is a gift
from the western countries.

506
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,160
Consume the herbal medicine
and remember it.

507
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,040
Do you have the medicine
for that?

508
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,560
Don't doubt.

509
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,000
If you doubt,
you won't find a solution.

510
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,760
Trust me.
You'll find the solution.

511
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,536
Do you suffer from this disease?
- No.

512
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:59,846
But you won't share it
with anyone, will you?

513
00:50:03,206 --> 00:50:05,646
Don't doubt.

514
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:08,566
I am the step to reach
the solution.

515
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:23,606
Mix a spoonful with the solvent

516
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:26,406
and get him to drink it daily.

517
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:29,246
Solvent?
- Liquid.

518
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:35,166
Such as water, juice, wine.

519
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:39,686
Hey, Mr. Benevolent!
Why did you donate the watch?

520
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:40,926
Forget that.
How do I get him to drink it?

521
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:45,886
Mix it with solvent and get
him to drink. Such as wine.

522
00:50:57,646 --> 00:50:58,566
There's no one.
Let's go.

523
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:06,138
Pal, do you think it will work?

524
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:22,009
Pal, I don't think half will do.
Add the whole thing.

525
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:30,217
What's up, guys?

526
00:51:33,134 --> 00:51:36,694
Well, Shivam.
Your dad is looking for you.

527
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:40,113
By the way, what are you
guys doing here?

528
00:51:40,678 --> 00:51:44,798
Actually, we are..
- We were coming to meet you.

529
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:46,118
Is that so?

530
00:51:46,198 --> 00:51:49,118
You are the star of nonfiction
entertainment. - What!

531
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,158
Come again!
- I meant, the reality TV show.

532
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:52,718
Then tell it like that, pal.

533
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:56,038
All my friends are too desperate
to meet you. - Is that so?

534
00:51:56,118 --> 00:51:58,318
Sir, please come with me.
- Is that so?

535
00:51:59,198 --> 00:52:01,678
Where to?
- All are in our room.

536
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:04,038
Please.
- Then let's go.

537
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,758
Let's go.
Where are my admirers?

538
00:52:10,078 --> 00:52:12,558
Come with me, I will introduce you.
- Let's go, pal.

539
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,995
Shivam, I'm sorry to
have lost my temper.

540
00:52:59,315 --> 00:53:02,155
The extent of problem you had
in dealing with what I said

541
00:53:02,835 --> 00:53:04,875
I had to gather much more
courage than that to break

542
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,035
this news to my teenage son.

543
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:10,195
For a long time, I was in doubt.

544
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,515
I was even confused about myself.

545
00:53:13,795 --> 00:53:17,355
I was wondering what's
happening with me.

546
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:21,955
I befriended..

547
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:25,275
I befriended even girls.

548
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:32,275
In college, I met your mom.

549
00:53:33,355 --> 00:53:34,435
I liked her company.

550
00:53:35,155 --> 00:53:38,155
And I confused a best friend's
friendship as love.

551
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,955
Then we got married,
but nothing changed.

552
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:46,235
I didn't want to confess
and ruin Nupur's life.

553
00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:50,715
Then you came into our lives.

554
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:53,075
That was the happiest
moment of my life.

555
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:54,275
And then Vidhi.

556
00:53:54,795 --> 00:53:57,195
I had felt that I could take
control of myself.

557
00:53:57,475 --> 00:53:58,555
Because I had the two of you.

558
00:53:59,675 --> 00:54:01,315
People saw us
as a perfect family.

559
00:54:01,715 --> 00:54:02,955
Me as a good husband.

560
00:54:04,155 --> 00:54:05,875
But I had been shattering
from within.

561
00:54:07,235 --> 00:54:11,435
I can't tell you how it feels
to lead a false life every day.

562
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,555
I just want you to know that
nothing has changed between us.

563
00:54:22,515 --> 00:54:23,635
I am still your father.

564
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:27,555
Now it doesn't matter to me
what people think about me.

565
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:32,715
What matters to me
is what you think about me.

566
00:54:34,595 --> 00:54:36,715
I just want everything
to be like before.

567
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:45,475
I am going to meet Arun.

568
00:55:42,635 --> 00:55:47,214
Oh, my! - What happened?
Nitin! What's wrong?

569
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,915
We are even in this matter,
not bad, Nitin.

570
00:55:51,784 --> 00:55:54,024
C-Can you please call the doctor?
- Oh, no! I'm sorry..

571
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:55,144
I-I'll do something about it.

572
00:55:57,664 --> 00:56:01,024
Oh, my God..

573
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:10,716
Mister!
Listen up!

574
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:13,196
Oh, God! Please wake up.
Mister, please get up.

575
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,556
The person living with me
is feeling unwell. - What?

576
00:56:15,796 --> 00:56:17,116
His stomach
is in excruciating pain.

577
00:56:17,196 --> 00:56:18,196
Do you have any medicines?

578
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:21,916
Everything will be closed now.
- Do you have a first-aid box?

579
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:25,556
I have to check.
- Check and get it upstairs.

580
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:27,156
Room number 201.
I'm in room number 201.

581
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:28,676
Come fast.
- I will check.

582
00:56:29,356 --> 00:56:30,516
Where is the first-aid box?

583
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:37,516
Sir..
I want to talk to you.

584
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:46,122
I guess it's stomach pain.

585
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,190
I think he ate stale food
while travelling.

586
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:55,349
But that's okay.

587
00:56:57,236 --> 00:56:59,436
Give him a table spoon
of both these medicines.

588
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:03,625
But what is it?
- It is a strong medicine.

589
00:57:03,745 --> 00:57:05,785
Whenever I have a stomach ache,
I drink it.

590
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:07,625
He should be fine
by tomorrow morning.

591
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:11,265
What if he doesn't recover?
- We'll call the doctor then.

592
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:14,905
I think there is no water.
I will get it.

593
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:42,863
Shivam..
Listen, wait!

594
00:57:45,263 --> 00:57:46,543
Be with your dad,
he needs you.

595
00:57:49,183 --> 00:57:51,303
Listen,
I know I have no right to say it.

596
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:53,899
But when he couldn't find you,
you should've seen his face.

597
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:56,179
He was extremely worried.

598
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:01,619
Shivam..

599
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:05,419
I understand it's difficult for you
but your dad is a great guy.

600
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:07,899
He is trying to reach out to you.

601
00:58:08,779 --> 00:58:10,059
Not everyone takes such efforts.

602
00:58:11,013 --> 00:58:11,973
Ask me, I know.

603
00:58:13,693 --> 00:58:15,253
I haven't met my family
from 15 years.

604
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:16,653
I miss them and my dad too.

605
00:58:19,177 --> 00:58:20,537
And it happened only because..

606
00:58:22,217 --> 00:58:24,897
He expected certain things
from me and I couldn't fulfil it.

607
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:27,337
I couldn't be the son
he wanted me to be.

608
00:58:28,777 --> 00:58:30,577
And you are doing exactly
what I did with my dad.

609
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:34,017
Just don't lose him, all right?

610
00:58:37,817 --> 00:58:38,697
And listen..

611
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:42,537
Don't get yourself in a situation
where you want him to be around

612
00:58:42,657 --> 00:58:43,497
but he isn't there for you.

613
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:47,337
Shivam..

614
01:00:15,897 --> 01:00:16,857
He is feeling better now.

615
01:00:21,737 --> 01:00:22,657
Are you leaving?

616
01:00:27,777 --> 01:00:28,737
Do you want to tell him something?

617
01:00:38,777 --> 01:00:42,297
Don't worry, I will..
I'm here for your dad.

618
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:50,417
No matter what, I will be
a part of the basketball team.

619
01:00:50,457 --> 01:00:53,257
Leave it.
I hope we get chicken for lunch.

620
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:56,617
Sure, you only think of chicken..
- You're right. - ...nothing else.

621
01:00:57,177 --> 01:00:58,217
You want to eat everything.

622
01:01:05,777 --> 01:01:07,217
Hey, Shivam.
Come on.

623
01:01:21,954 --> 01:01:24,674
Yes, Vidhi, I am fine.

624
01:01:24,962 --> 01:01:26,962
How are you?
- I'm fine too.

625
01:01:27,162 --> 01:01:28,882
Dad, how's your stomach ache now?

626
01:01:30,218 --> 01:01:31,418
It's okay now.

627
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:34,058
How do you know about it?
- Mom told me.

628
01:01:34,578 --> 01:01:38,858
How did mom..
- Dad, even I have a stomach ache.

629
01:01:38,898 --> 01:01:40,098
Do you have a stomach ache too?

630
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:43,818
I don't want to go to school.
- Darling, give it to me.

631
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:48,018
Hello.
Nitin, how are you feeling?

632
01:01:49,178 --> 01:01:52,178
Shivam called me.
- I'm feeling better.

633
01:01:53,738 --> 01:01:54,618
Did he say anything else?

634
01:01:54,658 --> 01:01:56,538
I won't go.
- Listen, I'll call back, okay?

635
01:01:56,578 --> 01:01:57,858
She started with her excuses again.

636
01:02:15,826 --> 01:02:18,106
I will leave now.

637
01:02:20,545 --> 01:02:24,465
Can I drop you somewhere?
- No, you can leave.

638
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:28,145
I might go to my house.

639
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,046
I'll also go and meet my dad.

640
01:02:43,004 --> 01:02:45,084
Thank you.
- Anytime.

641
01:02:47,524 --> 01:02:48,964
See you.
- Take care.

642
01:03:00,124 --> 01:03:03,364
"Carry me on your shoulders."

643
01:03:04,884 --> 01:03:08,124
"Take me on a journey
through the polders."

644
01:03:09,644 --> 01:03:13,124
"Gathered clouds in my backpack."

645
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:17,524
"My pockets are filled with stars."

646
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:22,004
"I'm still a young boy."

647
01:03:22,684 --> 01:03:26,364
"The world is vast."

648
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:31,284
"I'm yet to learn."

649
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:36,644
"I'll be ready when it's my turn."

650
01:03:40,604 --> 01:03:43,964
"Halt someplace and reminisce."

651
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:48,684
"It will spark memories in bliss."

652
01:03:50,124 --> 01:03:53,524
"Embrace all the happiness
in life."

653
01:03:54,884 --> 01:03:58,124
"Let the wind touch,
let everything revive."

654
01:03:58,364 --> 01:04:01,684
"I'm still a young boy."

655
01:04:03,204 --> 01:04:06,844
"The world is vast."

656
01:04:07,964 --> 01:04:12,004
"I'm yet to learn."

657
01:04:12,924 --> 01:04:16,644
"I'll be ready when it's my turn."

658
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:44,564
"Everyone returned except you."

659
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:48,764
"Days passed by, nights went blue."

660
01:04:49,724 --> 01:04:51,364
"Make your house of dreams"
- Hey, Shivam.

661
01:04:52,084 --> 01:04:53,884
"with hope."
- Don't you want to get down?

662
01:04:54,444 --> 01:04:58,364
"Don't be scared, you've a lot
of scope." - Be brave. Come on.

663
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:03,564
"I'll sleep" - Come. No?
You're a big boy now, right?

664
01:05:04,324 --> 01:05:07,804
"in your arms like a child."

665
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:12,524
"I'll fly under your wings"

666
01:05:12,724 --> 01:05:15,244
"in the wild."

667
01:05:32,604 --> 01:05:35,924
"Make me sit on your shoulder."

668
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:40,764
"Take me right away."

669
01:05:40,884 --> 01:05:44,924
"I am a young boy."

670
01:05:45,724 --> 01:05:49,924
"This world is vast."

671
01:05:50,324 --> 01:05:54,484
"I haven't learnt"

672
01:05:55,284 --> 01:06:00,044
"to fly yet."

673
01:06:50,524 --> 01:06:51,524
Hello, Shivam.

674
01:06:52,084 --> 01:06:53,204
Well done, dear.

675
01:06:54,004 --> 01:06:55,924
I learnt that you topped
in Mathematics.

676
01:06:56,484 --> 01:06:57,924
Mom is so proud of you.

677
01:06:58,524 --> 01:07:00,044
Listen to me.
I am coming for your ceremony.

678
01:07:00,404 --> 01:07:01,724
Do you need anything?

679
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:06,139
Dear, I did tell you
about Mr. Ayush, right?

680
01:07:06,419 --> 01:07:07,579
Even he will come with me.

681
01:07:08,419 --> 01:07:09,939
He has been longing to meet you.

682
01:07:10,579 --> 01:07:11,459
Do meet him.

683
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:15,139
Shivam?
- What about dad?

684
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:27,219
English topper from class eight,
Tejbeer Singh.

685
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:39,779
Maths topper from class nine,
Shivam Swaminathan.

686
01:07:45,139 --> 01:07:46,379
Come on, Shivam!

687
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:55,619
Social Science topper
from class nine, Ayush Tulsia.

688
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:06,339
Dad!

689
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:10,219
Congratulations.

690
01:08:12,979 --> 01:08:14,019
Wow!

691
01:08:18,259 --> 01:08:19,339
It's beautiful.

692
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:33,739
I am so proud of you.

693
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:37,859
Hi, Shivam.
Congratulations.

694
01:08:38,299 --> 01:08:39,339
You did well.

695
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:40,819
Hey, Nitin.
- Hi.

696
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:42,419
Good to see you.
I hope you are having a good time.

697
01:08:42,499 --> 01:08:43,579
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

698
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,939
Why are you addressing me as ma'am?
Come on! You can call me Sonica.

699
01:08:46,019 --> 01:08:47,379
Okay, ma'am.
Sonica.

700
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:50,819
Right. You didn't come
the previous time. We missed you.

701
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:53,979
You know what?
I have to leave.

702
01:08:54,059 --> 01:08:56,219
I'll catch you later.
- Sure. - All right. Come, Shivam.

703
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,219
Yes, ma'am.

704
01:09:10,019 --> 01:09:11,139
Smile, please!

705
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:17,539
Thank you, guys.

706
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:18,659
Thank you very much.

707
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:24,979
We have come from Delhi and..

708
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:29,139
Where can I meet you?
Can I meet you? - Sure.

709
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:33,219
Living in the art..
- Definitely.

710
01:09:33,539 --> 01:09:36,059
Ayush, I'll just be back.
- Sure..

711
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:42,699
Starry night!

712
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:48,179
How is Vidhi?

713
01:09:48,379 --> 01:09:50,579
She is fine.
I dropped her at the hostel.

714
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:53,499
She does create a fuss
before going to the hostel.

715
01:09:55,099 --> 01:09:56,659
You didn't tell me
that you are coming, Nitin.

716
01:10:00,459 --> 01:10:01,779
Neither did you.

717
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:04,619
Come on.
Stop pretending.

718
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:05,979
You know everything.

719
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:08,299
Isn't he a bit old for you?

720
01:10:08,459 --> 01:10:11,459
At least he is straight.
Until now!

721
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:12,699
Ouch!

722
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:16,859
Where are you staying?
- He has his own house here.

723
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:21,419
Mountain view. - Everything
has a mountain view out here.

724
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:23,699
It's known as a hill station.

725
01:10:25,779 --> 01:10:26,939
Mom, you came!

726
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:30,179
Very well done, dear!

727
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:32,099
After all, he is my son.

728
01:10:32,179 --> 01:10:34,259
Hey, you were never
so good in studies, Nitin.

729
01:10:34,499 --> 01:10:35,699
Nupur, what are you talking about?

730
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:36,739
You know that I was!

731
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:37,859
Your dad
just keeps saying all this.

732
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:39,339
Hi, I am Ayush Deewan.

733
01:10:43,795 --> 01:10:46,435
So, Shivam.
Congratulations.

734
01:10:46,515 --> 01:10:47,475
Thank you.

735
01:10:47,755 --> 01:10:49,155
So, what next?

736
01:10:49,515 --> 01:10:50,715
What are your plans for the day?

737
01:10:51,005 --> 01:10:52,005
Why don't we celebrate?

738
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:53,805
I have a huge house here!
You will love it!

739
01:10:54,325 --> 01:10:55,165
Isn't it, Nups?

740
01:10:56,565 --> 01:10:59,765
Actually, dad is taking me
and my friends out for dinner.

741
01:11:00,445 --> 01:11:01,685
So, what about tomorrow?

742
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:03,525
I have classes tomorrow.

743
01:11:03,725 --> 01:11:05,645
We are allowed for outings
only on Sundays.

744
01:11:05,805 --> 01:11:07,205
Okay, Sunday is perfect!

745
01:11:07,285 --> 01:11:08,405
He doesn't want
to come with you.

746
01:11:09,205 --> 01:11:11,725
Nitin, one second.

747
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,485
What is happening, Nitin?

748
01:11:17,525 --> 01:11:18,765
Why were you so rude to him?

749
01:11:20,325 --> 01:11:21,445
He was just trying too hard.

750
01:11:21,605 --> 01:11:23,125
Shivam didn't..
- So?

751
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,165
Come on, Nitin.
We are all trying hard.

752
01:11:26,045 --> 01:11:28,605
Do you think it was
very easy for me?

753
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:30,845
But I am trying, right?

754
01:11:32,005 --> 01:11:34,405
Why does it always have to be
about choices you have made?

755
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:38,525
Why is he calling you Nups?

756
01:11:44,405 --> 01:11:48,445
I guess
I am protective about you.

757
01:11:50,245 --> 01:11:51,165
I want you to be okay.

758
01:11:52,605 --> 01:11:53,605
Don't worry about me.

759
01:11:54,845 --> 01:11:55,805
I'll be okay.

760
01:12:01,965 --> 01:12:03,085
Shall we leave?

761
01:12:04,925 --> 01:12:07,285
Bye, Mom.
- Bye, my dear!

762
01:12:08,205 --> 01:12:09,405
Take care of yourself.
Okay?

763
01:12:09,485 --> 01:12:10,405
Yes.

764
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:16,845
What happened to you
all of a sudden?

765
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:20,925
I saw your mom
with someone else.

766
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:23,485
It's okay.

767
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:24,845
We'll deal with this also.

768
01:12:26,205 --> 01:12:27,445
Yes, I need to get out of here.

769
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:28,885
Let's get a drink.
- Let's go.

770
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:52,525
Dad.
Shall I ask you something?

771
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:54,245
Ask me anything.

772
01:12:55,165 --> 01:12:57,125
Do you find all guys attractive?

773
01:12:58,285 --> 01:12:59,925
Do you find all girls attractive?

774
01:13:01,045 --> 01:13:03,885
Not all.
- Same!

775
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:05,325
Not all.

776
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:10,885
Do you have anyone in life?

777
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:12,925
I mean, someone special.

778
01:13:15,405 --> 01:13:16,725
Do you have anyone in your life?

779
01:13:17,405 --> 01:13:19,805
Someone special?
- Dad, don't irritate. Tell me.

780
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:23,165
Not yet.
Your turn.

781
01:13:24,045 --> 01:13:27,125
Someone special?
No!

782
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:30,885
Who was she?
- Who?

783
01:13:31,645 --> 01:13:33,485
The one you were staring at
again and again

784
01:13:35,085 --> 01:13:37,045
at the party.
- Oh, that one?

785
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:41,485
Natasha.
- Natasha!

786
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:44,725
Does she know?
- What?

787
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:47,445
That you like her.

788
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:49,445
Of course not, Dad.
- Why?

789
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:53,285
Hey..
- Who will tell her? Your mom?

790
01:14:03,725 --> 01:14:04,965
109.

791
01:14:06,325 --> 01:14:08,245
This is 109.
- How do you know?

792
01:14:11,925 --> 01:14:13,045
Follow me.

793
01:14:17,725 --> 01:14:20,605
Come with me.
- Dad, let's go.

794
01:14:22,805 --> 01:14:24,365
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

795
01:14:26,445 --> 01:14:27,445
Come on!

796
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:28,885
Wait a minute.

797
01:14:36,045 --> 01:14:37,005
Yes.

798
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:52,125
Dad, what are you doing?

799
01:14:59,285 --> 01:15:03,205
Shivam!
- Hi, Natasha. I am Nitin.

800
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:06,205
My dad. - Oh! Hello, sir.
- Hi.

801
01:15:06,565 --> 01:15:07,845
I just wanted to meet you.

802
01:15:08,845 --> 01:15:12,085
Shivam keeps talking about you.
- Dad.

803
01:15:15,085 --> 01:15:15,965
Which class do you study in?

804
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:17,045
Ninth grade, sir.

805
01:15:17,445 --> 01:15:18,325
Nice!

806
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:21,085
Will you get down?
I will tell you everything.

807
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:27,565
Chouhan sir!
Is he still a cricket coach?

808
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:33,165
Chouhan sir.. - He'd once caught me
while getting into this hostel.

809
01:15:35,685 --> 01:15:38,805
He will catch you again
if you talk so loudly.

810
01:15:39,045 --> 01:15:39,845
Okay..

811
01:15:42,085 --> 01:15:43,205
It's a good thing that we met.

812
01:15:43,845 --> 01:15:45,605
I don't know when I will come
to Mussoorie next.

813
01:15:46,405 --> 01:15:48,685
I thought I'll come today.
- Dad!

814
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:54,525
It was nice meeting you, Natasha.

815
01:15:55,005 --> 01:15:56,805
Take care.
- Bye, sir.

816
01:16:03,045 --> 01:16:04,565
I am sorry.
- It's okay.

817
01:16:05,845 --> 01:16:08,485
Also, I wanted to say something
from a really long time.

818
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:11,085
And is this the way to say it?

819
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:15,485
Actually, I wanted to say that..

820
01:16:16,245 --> 01:16:18,885
I wanted to say
that I really like you.

821
01:16:19,605 --> 01:16:20,445
You, what?

822
01:16:22,005 --> 01:16:24,245
I really like you.
- Okay, go now.

823
01:17:07,965 --> 01:17:09,045
Follow me.

824
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:19,165
Even I wanted to tell you something
from a really long time.

825
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,725
I like you!

826
01:17:29,965 --> 01:17:33,285
I..
I really love you.

827
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,165
Dad, are you okay?

828
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:50,085
Hangover.

829
01:17:51,525 --> 01:17:53,925
Why do you think
they called us here?

830
01:17:54,445 --> 01:17:55,325
I don't know.

831
01:17:57,645 --> 01:18:02,005
She said she wanted to catch up
when I met her at the party.

832
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:03,845
I think this is why
she has called me here.

833
01:18:06,445 --> 01:18:08,765
Sir, ma'am is calling you inside.

834
01:18:16,445 --> 01:18:17,325
Hi, Sonica.

835
01:18:18,205 --> 01:18:19,365
Have I asked you to sit down?

836
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:24,325
Sit.

837
01:18:26,725 --> 01:18:28,805
Shivam, I don't even know
where to begin.

838
01:18:30,045 --> 01:18:31,805
Never before have we been
so embarrassed

839
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:33,485
because of a student's parent!

840
01:18:34,485 --> 01:18:35,965
Sonica, what I..
- Please don't interrupt me.

841
01:18:36,365 --> 01:18:38,285
Don't you feel ashamed
of doing such a thing?

842
01:18:38,925 --> 01:18:41,285
Shivam, do you have any idea
what your father did last night?

843
01:18:41,565 --> 01:18:43,165
I did a few things last night.

844
01:18:43,245 --> 01:18:45,245
I don't know which one
you are specifically referring to.

845
01:18:45,325 --> 01:18:48,525
For God's sake! The girls
hostel at 11'o clock in the night!

846
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:50,245
The watchman saw you!

847
01:18:50,845 --> 01:18:52,605
You even left
the bloody ladder behind!

848
01:18:53,285 --> 01:18:56,285
As an adult, I would expect him to
behave a little more responsibly.

849
01:18:57,245 --> 01:18:58,405
You find this funny!

850
01:18:58,885 --> 01:19:01,125
Ma'am, you don't know..
- You should be ashamed of him!

851
01:19:01,565 --> 01:19:03,285
Ma'am, you don't understand.

852
01:19:03,765 --> 01:19:05,365
He..
He is gay.

853
01:19:07,045 --> 01:19:10,765
Ma'am, how I wish he was
interested in women but he is not!

854
01:19:11,965 --> 01:19:13,045
He is gay!

855
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:14,485
What?

856
01:19:18,325 --> 01:19:19,765
You don't mean to come up
with a joke like that

857
01:19:19,845 --> 01:19:20,965
and get away with it, do you?

858
01:19:31,805 --> 01:19:33,885
No!
- Yes, ma'am.

859
01:19:34,925 --> 01:19:37,565
My father is gay
and I am proud of him.

860
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:39,485
No matter what

861
01:19:40,325 --> 01:19:41,285
I always will be.

862
01:19:45,085 --> 01:19:48,165
He was with me yesterday
as I wanted to meet someone.

863
01:19:53,285 --> 01:19:55,805
Whatever it is, I am extremely
upset about all this.

864
01:19:56,765 --> 01:19:59,685
Mr. Nitin, you have jeopardised
the reputation of my school

865
01:19:59,765 --> 01:20:01,125
for your atrocious behaviour!

866
01:20:01,645 --> 01:20:03,845
And I am going to need a written
apology from you for this.

867
01:20:05,405 --> 01:20:07,205
And Shivam, you are suspended
from the school

868
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:09,005
for an entire week
for your complete..

869
01:20:09,085 --> 01:20:10,525
But Sonica..
- What, Sonica?

870
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:11,845
Please address me as ma'am!

871
01:20:11,925 --> 01:20:14,405
Okay, Sonica..
Ma'am, it was I who..

872
01:20:14,485 --> 01:20:17,285
That will be all.
I said, that will be all!

873
01:20:26,245 --> 01:20:28,045
So, what now?
Home?

874
01:20:30,485 --> 01:20:31,685
Your mother will scold you.

875
01:20:32,605 --> 01:20:34,245
You got suspended because of me.

876
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:42,085
But that's cool!
A week's extended holiday.

877
01:20:43,165 --> 01:20:44,125
Suspension.

878
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:53,885
Dad, how far is Manali from here?

879
01:20:55,245 --> 01:20:56,125
Can we drive there?

880
01:21:00,325 --> 01:21:01,285
Get in.

881
01:21:12,485 --> 01:21:16,445
"We have moved on."

882
01:21:17,645 --> 01:21:20,205
"If someone comes along with me."

883
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:26,645
"We will meet again"

884
01:21:28,045 --> 01:21:30,925
"even if we get lost."

885
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:40,805
"A problem is solved."

886
01:21:47,925 --> 01:21:51,845
"We have witnessed a new morning."

887
01:22:21,605 --> 01:22:24,605
"It was drowning somewhere."

888
01:22:31,925 --> 01:22:35,725
"It was my breath."

889
01:22:38,485 --> 01:22:45,125
"There were many problems."

890
01:22:45,205 --> 01:22:49,925
"It seemed very childish
with you."

891
01:22:50,005 --> 01:22:52,965
"It seemed of no use."

892
01:22:55,405 --> 01:23:03,325
"I got everything I lost."

893
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:07,045
"My eyes are opening slowly."

894
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:11,045
"It is awake now."

895
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:22,485
"A problem is solved."

896
01:23:28,845 --> 01:23:32,845
"We have witnessed a new morning."

897
01:23:58,565 --> 01:24:02,605
"So, come!"

898
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:06,245
"Let's go together."

899
01:24:06,365 --> 01:24:11,885
"Come on with me."

900
01:24:12,525 --> 01:24:15,125
"Let's fill the new times"

901
01:24:15,245 --> 01:24:18,285
"with the new moments and dreams."
