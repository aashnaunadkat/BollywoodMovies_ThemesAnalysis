1
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,167
<i>I never imagined</i>

2
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,333
<i>that someday,</i>
<i>life will give me something</i>

3
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,917
<i>I never asked for.</i>

4
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,292
Radhika, listen to me.

5
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,250
Hello, I am Jitendra Dixit

6
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,083
and it's time for
tonight's breaking news.

7
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,083
<i>Vikram Kapoor had</i>
<i>an accident a while ago.</i>

8
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,667
<i>We tried to contact</i>
<i>Vikram Kapoor's father,</i>

9
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,667
<i>Pratap Kapoor for his comments.</i>

10
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,083
<i>But we can't reach him right now.</i>

11
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,417
<i>And now another big news</i>
<i>about Vikram Kapoor.</i>

12
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,917
<i>Vikram Kapoor fashion label's star model</i>

13
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,292
- <i>Sarah Breganza has committed suicide.</i>
- Sarah Breganza Death or suicide?

14
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,833
<i>Could there be any link between</i>
<i>Vikram Kapoor's accident</i>

15
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,958
<i>and Sarah's suicide?</i>

16
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:15,750
<i>It's too soon to make</i>
<i>that connection.</i>

17
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,667
But both the incidents
occurred on the same evening

18
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,458
which makes it all the more
bizarre and mysterious.

19
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,042
<i>But we hope that the truth</i>
<i>behind Vikram Kapoor's accident</i>

20
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,917
<i>and Sarah Breganza's suicide</i>
<i>will be unveiled soon.</i>

21
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,583
<i>This just came in.</i>

22
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,000
<i>Vikram Kapoor has survived</i>
<i>the brutal accident,</i>

23
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,250
<i>and he's out of danger now.</i>

24
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,000
Two roasted corns.

25
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,125
Mandwa, Alibaug.

26
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,625
Last stop, all alight here.

27
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,458
Sir. Sarah's parents.

28
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,583
Newspaper. Newspaper.

29
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,042
Do we have to escort them home?

30
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,083
I mean... just a thought.

31
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,958
Doesn't that house scare you, sir?

32
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,708
What is it?

33
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,917
- He scared me.
- Newspaper?

34
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,042
- Only two rupees.
- Get lost.

35
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,417
Ever heard about
basic decency, Pandey?

36
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,667
Their daughter's funeral
is in two days.

37
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,542
We held up that funeral.

38
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,708
Vikram is also returning home.

39
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,667
Make me a hot cup of tea.

40
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,583
Finally, you found some time for me.

41
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,750
Unfortunately,
since madam was murdered,

42
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,333
the police have been
keeping me on my toes.

43
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,458
- I know.
- Wait...

44
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,833
Listen.

45
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,292
- Sir.
- Hail India.

46
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,542
- You got the place cleaned up, Shinde?
- Yes, sir.

47
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,917
- Any visitors?
- No, sir.

48
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:28,500
I've kept everything in its place.

49
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,625
- Open the door.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:41,667
Lots of colors, innovative designs,
different textures.

51
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,750
Your favorite
Ryo Mark's personal touch.

52
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,042
Rads.

53
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,292
Radhika.

54
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,250
Rads, I can't understand
what you're looking for.

55
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,750
The fashion show is
just around the corner

56
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,667
and we aren't ready yet.

57
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,292
The entire responsibility is on us.

58
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,625
What on earth are you doing?

59
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,958
We don't even have a brand ambassador.

60
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,375
Radhika, I was looking for you.

61
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,542
Actually, this is for Mr. Vikram.

62
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,750
Radhika.

63
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,792
Ever since they started going out,

64
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,083
she's acting like the new boss.

65
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,000
You know,
I've witnessed their affair.

66
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:23,292
Put it in the car.

67
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,083
Radhika.

68
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,542
I shouldn't be talking
about your personal matters,

69
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,417
but the entire office is talking about it.

70
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:41,958
I should leave.

71
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,583
I am running late for Alibaug.

72
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:51,750
Next time, you grab my arm...

73
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,917
I'll break it.

74
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,917
Here we are.

75
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,250
- How are you?
- I am fine.

76
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,208
Give Vikram a hand.

77
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,667
- Get Vikram's luggage.
- Yes.

78
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,792
Romila.

79
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,083
Romila.

80
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,375
Let's go.

81
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,542
Kaka.

82
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,417
I've still got hands.

83
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,125
Not there.

84
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,500
We've prepped up a room
for you downstairs.

85
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:29,958
Come.

86
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,167
- This way.
- Romzi.

87
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:34,667
Where have you been, Romzi?

88
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,208
I've prepped up a room
for you downstairs.

89
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:45,042
So you won't have the
trouble of going upstairs.

90
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,792
Let us know if you have
a problem with the room downstairs.

91
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,042
Romzi, did you...

92
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,792
Stop showing sympathy.

93
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,167
At least, you should've known,

94
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,917
I don't like staying in any other room.

95
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,000
Upstairs is a problem.

96
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,500
I understand.

97
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,583
Vikram.

98
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How are you?

99
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,917
I brought your favorite flowers.

100
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,875
What do these florists
think of themselves?

101
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,167
This bouquet has more
leaves than flowers.

102
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,750
And they charge you so exorbitantly

103
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,625
like they grow on trees.

104
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,417
I mean, they are not all that bad.

105
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:44,000
But listen, I don't understand
half the things these models say.

106
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,417
"Can you up the hem of my skirt,
I'll look cuter".

107
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,083
By the way, I can give lessons
in diction, you know that.

108
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,625
Why aren't you saying anything?

109
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,292
I will if you let me.

110
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:06,333
Who brought the cake?

111
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,958
I believe every cake
deserves to have a candle.

112
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,875
What do I wish for?

113
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,167
Escape from your fashion sense.

114
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,667
But there's no way
I can do that either.

115
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,708
Sometimes when you're being funny...

116
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,000
Did I step over the line?

117
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,417
Are you angry?

118
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,833
Even if you're angry,
I'm not going to apologize.

119
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,250
Have you ever apologized to anyone?

120
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,625
I haven't

121
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,042
But I will.

122
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:28,375
<i>The silent winds</i>
<i>Blowing in my direction</i>

123
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,375
<i>And the unfinished conversations</i>

124
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,250
<i>What remains now?</i>

125
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,875
<i>The place you hold in my heart</i>

126
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:51,250
<i>I could never convey</i>

127
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,042
<i>What remains now?</i>

128
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,000
<i>What remains now?</i>

129
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,083
<i>The conversations have changed</i>

130
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,542
<i>Nor have the coincidences</i>

131
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,750
<i>But you're the one thing</i>

132
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,708
<i>That I don't have</i>

133
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,708
<i>My forlorn love</i>

134
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,208
<i>Still awaits</i>

135
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,750
<i>Where could you be?</i>

136
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,750
<i>My forlorn love still awaits</i>

137
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,083
<i>Where could you be?</i>

138
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,208
<i>Where could you be?</i>

139
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:38,167
<i>I keep talking</i>

140
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:42,417
<i>Believing, you're still around</i>

141
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:47,667
<i>I still love you</i>

142
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:52,917
<i>Because I know you're not here</i>

143
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,375
<i>I love you more than myself</i>

144
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,792
<i>And won't hesitate to give up</i>

145
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,917
<i>This life for you</i>

146
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:06,792
<i>I'll stay alive</i>

147
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:11,333
<i>And wait for you</i>

148
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,333
<i>My forlorn love</i>

149
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,833
<i>Sill awaits</i>

150
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,375
<i>Where could you be?</i>

151
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,667
Brother!

152
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,792
How are you, my dear?

153
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,458
- How are you?
- I am fine.

154
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,167
Did you see my gift?

155
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,125
See it?

156
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,417
Romzi, the way Vikram
treated you this morning...

157
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,042
He's finally come home
after a long time.

158
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,417
I am just worried about Nandini.

159
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,292
She's growing up, you know.

160
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,625
And...

161
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,917
I don't want her to witness this drama.

162
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,500
Anyway...

163
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,958
you don't need to worry.

164
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,792
- Stay with Vikram.
- Yes, sir.

165
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,167
Take care.

166
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,000
Kaka, don't be such a spoilsport.

167
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,542
You could've let me
sleep a little longer.

168
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,333
Rising early morning
is good for health.

169
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,417
Wake up.

170
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,292
Sir!

171
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,458
Are you hurt?

172
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,458
Careful...

173
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:36,042
No, I was so happy
to be home, I forgot...

174
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,000
But I am fine.

175
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,458
- I'll do something.
- Okay.

176
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,542
Wait a minute.

177
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:42,750
You...

178
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,417
Careful.

179
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:59,875
Now you're looking
handsome and smart.

180
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,833
- Sir.
- Let me see.

181
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,125
Well...

182
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,667
You can reach your room now.
I've made sure of that.

183
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,792
Anything else?

184
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,958
There's no end to this list, dad.

185
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,458
Shall we?

186
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,042
I can't see Radhika around.

187
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,167
It was really unfortunate.

188
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,458
And at such a young age.

189
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,708
Wasn't she the brand ambassador
of your company as well, Narang?

190
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,333
Yes.

191
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,083
But I was talking about Vikram.

192
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:43,875
Pratap.

193
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,625
Give Romila my love.

194
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,125
My daughter couldn't
have committed suicide.

195
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,917
How are you, Vikram?

196
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,625
- When did you return home?
- Mr. Roy?

197
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,667
What was Sarah's mother saying?

198
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,125
"She was depressed.
She shot herself."

199
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:24,542
That's what everyone's saying.

200
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,208
The media and public
form their own opinion

201
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:33,292
before cops could
draw a conclusion.

202
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,500
I don't understand.

203
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,542
Sir...

204
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:41,458
Sarah was supposed to get married.

205
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,917
And suddenly this?

206
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:46,917
I don't understand...

207
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The police have no business
if things are uncomplicated.

208
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,750
Vikram, can you dial
this number for me?

209
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,083
Could you put it on speaker?

210
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:24,458
<i>The number you're trying</i>
<i>to call is currently unavailable.</i>

211
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:25,875
A friend of yours?

212
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:32,042
He didn't even show up
for his fiancée's funeral.

213
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,042
And I thought...

214
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,792
Jimmy can never do
such a thing, sir.

215
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:46,458
Why would he do such a thing?

216
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:48,458
Love has a crooked sense of humor.

217
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:56,958
It gives you a reason to die
and a motive to kill.

218
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,208
I can't figure out whether
cases are always complicated

219
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,917
or you guys make it look that way.

220
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,292
- Hail India, sir.
- Hail India, sir.

221
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:22,833
Vikram!

222
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,083
That's no way to drive!

223
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,292
Are you okay?

224
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,417
Slowly, slowly...

225
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:55,500
No, thanks.

226
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:56,625
Please have some.

227
00:26:58,792 --> 00:26:59,750
Kaka!

228
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,583
Yes.

229
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,583
Who moved the photo from here?

230
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,500
Who did it?

231
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,375
What's wrong, Vikram?

232
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,917
Why are you screaming?

233
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,500
It was your idea.

234
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,250
So I had it moved upstairs
with the rest of your stuff.

235
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:19,542
I thought someone kept
it here accidentally.

236
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:21,667
What did you say?

237
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,708
Accidentally?

238
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:26,292
And what about this picture?

239
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,917
This is not here by accident?

240
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,583
- Bring the picture?
- Yes.

241
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,708
You are not my family.

242
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,292
Just my dad's wife, that's all.

243
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:51,667
That wasn't nice of you, Vikram.

244
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,667
- Romila.
- What?

245
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:55,833
Romzi!

246
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,667
What happened?

247
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,250
It's nothing, Pratap.

248
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,667
Everything has its place.

249
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:07,125
Even if it's a photo frame.

250
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,208
What are you doing?

251
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:12,708
You'll hurt yourself.

252
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,708
Kaka, can you
clean this up, please?

253
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:16,458
Are you okay?

254
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,375
Are you hurt?

255
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,667
Kaka, better get all
these pictures out of the way.

256
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,583
They might get in Vikram's way.

257
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,208
And please serve dinner.

258
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,542
It's bleeding.

259
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,917
Quickly bring some ice.

260
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,333
Dip it in cold water.

261
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,875
He's having an affair...

262
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,083
- Believe me.
- Listen to me, sir.

263
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,250
No, you listen to me.

264
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,667
Be quiet, and let him speak.

265
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,458
I asked to get two <i>vadapavs</i>,
and you got only one.

266
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:53,875
- Leave.
- Sorry, sir.

267
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:58,583
So Dabboo Ratnani...

268
00:28:58,667 --> 00:28:59,667
- Hello, sir.
- Sit.

269
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,208
Looks like you've developed
a special attachment to this lady.

270
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,417
Not at all.

271
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,833
You've got the entire portfolio.

272
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,500
What are you saying?

273
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:08,792
You messed up the job

274
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:10,042
and now you want a <i>vadapav</i>?

275
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,292
Jimmy.

276
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:32,000
So you did come for
one last meeting with Sarah.

277
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:47,375
Or you came to find out
how Vikram survived?

278
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,458
Mumbai, Malabar Hill Police Station.

279
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,875
Inspector Roy, Alibaug.

280
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,792
I've told you before,
we can't meet like this.

281
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,917
Your name's come up
in Sarah murder case.

282
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,458
If anyone suspects me,
they'll throw me in jail with you.

283
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,208
Did you bring the money?

284
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:50,125
Here you go.

285
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,917
All unmarked bullets.

286
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,917
How are you going to use them?

287
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,333
Do you have a gun?

288
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:24,542
Kaka.

289
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:27,833
What do you think?

290
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,833
Am I going to win this game or not?

291
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,042
You lose.

292
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:38,750
I still have one move left, Kaka.

293
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,292
Save thy queen.

294
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:57,583
No one can ever defeat you.

295
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,542
I'll be back in a minute.

296
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,792
I forgot these letters here.

297
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,625
Are we going to keep meeting like this?

298
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:05,833
Nice way to call lust as love.

299
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,500
Vikram?

300
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,208
Vikram Kapoor?

301
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:26,708
Sarah. Move.

302
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:28,250
First, you quit Narang's company,

303
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,792
and now in this hotel room...

304
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:46,458
Who is he, Sarah?

305
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,500
We were supposed to get married.

306
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:08,333
Did you get the CCTV
footage from Sarah's home?

307
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,375
No, sir.

308
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:12,292
I spoke with the guard,
but the footage was stolen.

309
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,333
Did you get permission
to raid Jimmy's home?

310
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,542
Pandey, at least serve me
a strong cup of tea in the morning.

311
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,375
Helps me wake up.

312
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,000
- Roy.
<i>- Kadam from Mumbai Crime Branch.</i>

313
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,083
<i>You've been granted search</i>
<i>warrant for Jimmy Breganza's home.</i>

314
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,750
I thought we'd lose this one.

315
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,583
We've got the permission.

316
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,042
Got you.

317
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,000
He was toying around
with me for a long time.

318
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,750
Now I'll make you disappear.

319
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,875
<i>Are you ignoring me?</i>

320
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,917
<i>I am confused, Vikram.</i>

321
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,958
Brother, how do we catch them?

322
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:53,208
Nandini, if you want to catch them,

323
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,375
you must toy with them first.

324
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:56,958
Understand?

325
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,250
Go and watch how he does it.

326
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,208
Kaka.

327
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,375
<i>I am going out of town</i>
<i>for costume trials.</i>

328
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:05,667
<i>I'll see you when I get back.</i>

329
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,542
<i>The painful moments</i>

330
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,917
<i>Cold breeze</i>

331
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,625
<i>Life's frightened</i>

332
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,792
<i>Breathing is an effort</i>

333
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:43,542
<i>A fear lurks in my heart</i>

334
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:48,625
<i>That your silence might</i>

335
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:51,208
<i>Ultimately kill me</i>

336
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:57,458
<i>Why has life brought me to the edge?</i>

337
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,875
<i>The world's asleep</i>

338
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,542
<i>So are the skies</i>

339
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,875
<i>The world's asleep</i>

340
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,583
<i>So are the skies</i>

341
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,708
<i>All the destinations</i>
<i>Are fast asleep</i>

342
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:26,625
<i>All the destinations</i>

343
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,542
<i>And so have the roads</i>

344
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:32,333
<i>The world's asleep</i>

345
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,708
<i>So are the skies</i>

346
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,292
<i>The world's asleep</i>

347
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:40,708
<i>So are the skies</i>

348
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:03,583
<i>The pain doesn't let me sleep</i>

349
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:07,500
Now, do you trust me?

350
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,583
By the way, what would you prefer?

351
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,125
You suggest.

352
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:25,875
You never asked me
what I preferred?

353
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,000
<i>These painful moments</i>

354
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,292
<i>Life's in pain</i>

355
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,458
No, Radhika...

356
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,708
You didn't tell her about us.

357
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,333
<i>Gradually, your silence</i>

358
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,500
Radhika.

359
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:48,000
<i>Will kill me</i>

360
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,958
<i>Life's brought me</i>
<i>To a strange crossroad</i>

361
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:53,042
Vikram.

362
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,708
You can break my heart.

363
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:01,833
Just don't hurt my ego.

364
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:06,958
<i>The world's asleep</i>
<i>So are the skies</i>

365
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,042
Radhika.

366
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:18,042
Vikram's accident and that
party were on the same day.

367
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,167
- Did you find anything else?
- No, sir.

368
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,500
Sir, I can't figure out one thing.

369
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,542
Why did Radhika suddenly leave?

370
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,083
She loved Vikram

371
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,125
and maybe she
couldn't stand that...

372
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,625
You mean Vikram and Sarah?

373
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:38,167
And Jimmy knew that too.

374
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,583
That's why we're searching
Jimmy's house.

375
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,833
Jimmy's cell phone
is connected to the Wi-Fi.

376
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,500
He's nearby.

377
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:05,833
So this is where you're hiding.

378
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:08,458
Finish the download.

379
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,125
Hey, he's here.

380
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,375
Yes, sir.

381
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:34,417
Anil.

382
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,167
Catch him. He's heading downstairs.

383
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,500
- There he is!
- Hurry up.

384
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,958
- Catch him!
- Get him!

385
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,417
Wait!

386
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,917
Catch him. Catch him.

387
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,125
Idiot.

388
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,458
Stop.

389
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,625
Wait!

390
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:13,750
There's no escape.

391
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:33,458
Sir, he's up there.

392
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,417
Jimmy!

393
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,583
Don't try anything foolish.

394
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,208
The guard saw you
standing next to Sarah's body.

395
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,125
Don't try to run.

396
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,458
You were behind Vikram's accident,
weren't you?

397
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,042
You've run out of options, Jimmy.

398
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,417
Come with me.

399
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:24,458
Jimmy.

400
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:34,583
What happened?
We haven't finished the game yet.

401
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,583
I don't want to play with you.

402
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,625
You always cheat.

403
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,708
Cheat? Do I?

404
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:44,083
Well...

405
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,125
How will I win if I don't cheat?

406
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,083
It's because you play so well.

407
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,583
I don't want to play with you.

408
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:53,542
Nandini.

409
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:59,750
Oh, my God. That anger!

410
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,167
- What happened?
- Brother cheated to defeat me.

411
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:06,500
- Did he cheat?
- Yes.

412
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,083
Fine, come play with me.

413
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:10,458
You're a bigger cheater than him.

414
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't want to play with anyone.

415
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,667
Nandini.

416
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:21,500
She's taken after you.

417
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:34,250
I shouldn't have sent you
to the boarding school.

418
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,833
After your mother died...

419
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,083
I couldn't fulfill
my duty as your father.

420
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,833
I neglected you.

421
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:52,792
Maybe that's why you're
still angry with me.

422
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:56,708
Fine. I understand.

423
00:42:58,583 --> 00:42:59,583
You should be.

424
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,708
No, dad.

425
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:12,167
You named your daughter Nandini

426
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:15,042
and kept my mother alive.

427
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:01,750
The bullet analysis
from Sarah murder case.

428
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:04,000
There is a match.

429
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,500
Pandey, when a bullet is fired,

430
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:12,875
it has only one goal.

431
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,208
To hit a target.

432
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:18,375
With traces it leaves behind,
you can determine

433
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:21,042
which gun it was fired from.

434
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:25,292
Prepare for the press
conference, Pandey.

435
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,333
I can see you're feeling embarrassed.

436
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,417
Back in the hospital, there
were pretty nurses to bathe me.

437
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,125
Not an 80-year-old man.

438
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,042
You're incorrigible.

439
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,833
Glasses and cell phone.

440
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,458
This too.

441
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,125
Kaka.

442
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:05,542
I'll be right back
after serving her tea.

443
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,042
Brother.

444
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,417
Kaka.

445
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,250
Wait, there's a cockroach here.

446
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:11,750
Come and clean this.

447
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:52,958
But after Vikram's accident,

448
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,917
But the incident today,
that could've been fatal.

449
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:06,000
Vikram's reports have
arrived from the US.

450
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:07,958
Chances are he'll be 100 % cured.

451
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,333
I've invited the
doctors over next week.

452
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:12,833
But I haven't told him yet.

453
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,000
That's great news, Kamlesh.

454
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,208
Come.

455
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:23,958
Vikram.

456
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,125
Whatever differences we have,

457
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,917
I don't want anyone else
to get hurt because of it.

458
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,083
Take care.

459
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:47,125
Our sources tell us that
Jimmy has escaped from custody.

460
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:49,333
We just want to know...

461
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:52,917
Inspector Roy,
we have many questions...

462
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:55,333
All I can tell you

463
00:48:55,917 --> 00:49:00,542
is that the truth and Jimmy
Breganza shall be soon before you.

464
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:03,250
What is your team's
strategy to catch him?

465
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:06,833
Jimmy Breganza is the prime
suspect in Sarah murder case.

466
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:17,583
And if anyone spots him, dial 100.

467
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,208
Vikram!

468
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:33,250
Vikram!

469
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:39,583
Nandini.

470
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:44,542
What happened, brother?

471
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:46,792
Nothing.

472
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:50,458
Promise me, you'll get well soon.

473
00:49:55,583 --> 00:50:00,083
I promise to get better
and I won't cheat you.

474
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,167
Why didn't you go to school?

475
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:09,458
I'll go in a while.

476
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:11,000
Who goes to school on a Monday?

477
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,000
Bunk it.

478
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:13,542
Yeah.

479
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:14,458
Vikram.

480
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,083
Fatty.

481
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,375
You're eating a lot lately.

482
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:30,667
I am fasting today.

483
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:31,750
Inspector Roy.

484
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:32,833
Keep it.

485
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:34,375
Please come in.

486
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:36,792
You won't have to wait.

487
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:38,500
- Please come.
- Yes.

488
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,958
Sorry for troubling you two.

489
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,583
What happened, Mr. Roy?

490
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,250
You were going to tell us something.

491
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,458
Why did you call us here?

492
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,583
Sarah's forensic reports have arrived.

493
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:53,083
The bullet recovered from her body

494
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,583
wasn't fired from the gun
that was found near her body.

495
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:00,417
The angle of fire

496
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:05,375
proves that Sarah
didn't shoot herself.

497
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:07,792
In fact, someone killed her

498
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:11,917
and tried to make it look like
it was suicide.

499
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,458
You guys work so hard.

500
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:29,333
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>only after the person's death.</i>

501
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:32,500
How is all this connected to us?

502
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,042
Good sense of humor.

503
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:36,917
The gun that we found...

504
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,875
that's not the murder weapon.

505
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:46,458
What is he saying, Vikram?

506
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,458
<i>Stop this drama, Sarah.</i>

507
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:54,000
I am not being desperate, Vikram.

508
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:58,167
You were looking desperate.

509
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:01,375
With that intern of yours.

510
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,042
The bullet recovered from her body...

511
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:11,500
was fired from your registered gun.

512
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:13,750
My gun?

513
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:18,500
My gun with Sarah?

514
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,667
Only Vikram can tell us.

515
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,042
Sarah, what happened between us
was a freaking mistake

516
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:30,125
and you never told me
you were going to marry Jimmy.

517
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:37,000
Jimmy's been threatening me
since that night.

518
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:43,167
Please leave.

519
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:54,833
<i>So, Vikram?</i>

520
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:56,667
<i>Sarah was killed with</i>
<i>the same gun. How?</i>

521
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,250
Who ordered the hit?

522
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:03,875
How would I know?

523
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,958
Why are you involving
Vikram in all this?

524
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:10,458
Vikram had an accident
on the night of the party.

525
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:14,292
Sarah's death and
Jimmy's disappearance.

526
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,250
It all can't be a coincidence.

527
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:20,417
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>you're trying to imply?</i>

528
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,083
<i>Had you done your job properly,</i>
<i>you would've realized</i>

529
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,417
<i>our house was burgled.</i>

530
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,958
Along with other things,
I reported my gun was stolen.

531
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,917
And that report was sent to your home.

532
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,292
- Get out!
- <i>Didn't you get it?</i>

533
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,167
What are you doing?

534
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:37,250
What are you doing?

535
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:39,583
Sarah.

536
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:40,750
I'll go to the media.

537
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:42,667
I'll tell them
what you've done to me.

538
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:06,333
Serial numbers MMW1991 to MMW2014

539
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,333
are registered in your name.

540
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,917
You still have 18 bullets.

541
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:12,333
You fired four of them.

542
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,667
Yes.

543
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,125
The empty shells

544
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:18,542
which you handed
over to the department.

545
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:26,792
But your gun is still missing

546
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:30,917
and there is one dead girl.

547
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:40,667
Sarah.

548
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,750
The police searched my home

549
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,583
and if you want,
you can come and search again.

550
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:05,875
A girl is dead and you're
still harping on about the gun.

551
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,833
There is still one
bullet left in that gun.

552
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:23,958
I suspect...

553
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,208
it's marked for someone.

554
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:41,917
Not yet.

555
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:45,625
My lawyers will talk to you.

556
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:53,333
Sarah murder case will
be solved pretty soon.

557
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,208
Jimmy's in our custody.

558
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:12,292
The police suspect
just about everyone.

559
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:19,667
Sarah snatched that gun from me.

560
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:30,292
Hello, Bansal.

561
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,542
The police haven't
found the gun yet.

562
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,583
- Now leave.
- Yes, madam.

563
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,167
Romila.

564
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,208
Dinner's served.

565
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,667
Do join us.

566
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:57,500
Thank you, but I must leave now.

567
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:21,708
Sir.

568
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,208
You could've called
if you didn't plan on coming.

569
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:36,333
I had ordered your favorite dish.

570
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:37,833
I waited for you
at the restaurant,

571
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:38,917
but you didn't show up.

572
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,958
How long are you going to wait?

573
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:41,042
What?

574
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,125
What did you say?

575
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,125
How long will you wait
for me to get better?

576
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,167
Six months, a year?

577
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,125
What happens next?

578
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:55,750
I guess you're in a mood to argue.

579
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,417
I'll come back tomorrow.

580
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,500
I am leaving.

581
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:03,375
Don't come back.

582
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:10,958
What's wrong, Vikram?

583
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,375
Is this a joke?

584
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,333
I've become a joke.

585
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:22,125
A joke that is suffocating me.

586
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,000
This leg!

587
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:26,958
This wheelchair!

588
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:32,417
You're only seeing
what you want to see.

589
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:35,667
Try to see what life's trying to show you.

590
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:40,292
And you?

591
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,625
What do you want to show me?

592
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,625
That you love me?

593
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,833
People have sympathy
for cripples, Radhika.

594
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,000
What did you say?

595
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,292
Every day, I try to suppress
my sorrows and stand before you,

596
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,583
because I want to see you happy.

597
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:14,625
Even I have feelings, Vikram.

598
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,625
I also feel pain.

599
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,750
If you really feel so bad,
why don't you leave?

600
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,583
I don't want to live on false hopes.

601
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:36,333
You have your whole life
ahead of you, Vikram.

602
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,083
But you don't want to look forward to it

603
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,083
because you've already given up.

604
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,042
And I...

605
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:53,333
I can't bear to see you
like this anymore.

606
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:23,833
<i>The pain in my heart</i>

607
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:27,625
<i>Is hard to convey</i>

608
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:31,542
<i>Tell me how?</i>

609
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:36,667
<i>After taking you away from yourself</i>

610
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:42,792
<i>I am bidding you goodbye</i>

611
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:49,375
<i>Let me touch your soul</i>

612
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:04,083
A list of boats that have
ferried between Mumbai and Mandwa

613
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,417
in the last two months.

614
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,708
One of these boats
is owned by Vikram Kapoor

615
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:10,542
that plies to and fro frequently.

616
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,417
These are rich people, Pandey.

617
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:15,083
They earn in Mumbai
and blow it all in Mandwa.

618
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,208
But you told Vikram Kapoor and also

619
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:20,167
at the press conference
that Jimmy's in our custody.

620
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:22,750
Often a lie unearths the truth.

621
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,208
- Is the boat ready?
- Yes, sir.

622
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,292
<i>Tonight at 1:30</i>

623
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:37,208
<i>Hello, I am Jitendra Dixit.</i>

624
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:38,625
<i>And now for today's breaking news.</i>

625
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:42,542
<i>The investigating officer</i>
<i>of Sarah murder case</i>

626
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:45,500
<i>said that the case is still open.</i>

627
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:50,042
<i>Because Sarah's killer</i>
<i>is still at large.</i>

628
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,792
How long have you had this video?

629
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,208
Romila.

630
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,708
I'm telling you again...

631
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:34,458
He looks innocent, but he isn't.

632
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:37,458
That night...

633
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:41,750
You better listen to me or else...

634
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,250
Who came to meet Romila last night?

635
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,458
I don't know, sir.

636
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:14,000
Why is the footage between
1:30 and 3 missing?

637
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,042
I guess there was a power outage.

638
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,292
Turn the generators on.

639
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:26,000
Provide backup power
to all the machines, understood?

640
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,667
Bansal, just a minute.

641
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:43,667
Yes, Mr. Sharma.

642
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:46,417
Could I ever refuse you?

643
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:47,750
A wedding, huh?

644
01:03:56,917 --> 01:04:00,000
Vikram's involvement in
Sarah murder case spells trouble.

645
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:04,083
Did you know about their affair?

646
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:15,583
Yeah.

647
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:18,917
- Yeah?
<i>- Dad, listen. It's very urgent.</i>

648
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,458
I am coming over to see you.

649
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:33,083
When Sarah broke off
her engagement with Jimmy,

650
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:35,292
Jimmy blamed Vikram for it.

651
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,083
Sarah's death...

652
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:38,750
Jimmy? But wasn't he...

653
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,583
He hasn't been arrested yet.

654
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:44,833
I must talk to Vikram.

655
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,208
Not yet, Pratap.

656
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,292
Don't do anything yet.

657
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:50,708
I will talk to Vikram.

658
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,375
<i>Yeah, Romzi.</i>

659
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:55,125
Pratap, I've cut my hand.
It's bad.

660
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,417
Narang, you?

661
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:53,958
Just leave.

662
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:55,583
These days, Pratap looks happy

663
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:58,292
because Vikram returned home safely.

664
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,208
Vikram...

665
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:10,292
He's a tough guy.

666
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:13,500
He survived even after
such a brutal accident.

667
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:16,083
What are you saying?

668
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:20,125
I told you last night.

669
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:22,583
We'll meet again
when the time's right.

670
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:24,167
Last night,

671
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,250
Vikram saw you with me.

672
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,125
Thank God,

673
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:34,333
I got the CCTV footage
deleted or else...

674
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:35,875
Stop this game, Romila.

675
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,000
I am going nuts.

676
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:42,583
I can't work or get
my life back on track.

677
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:52,667
I wander from pillar to post
just to get a glimpse of you.

678
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,542
- That room's already cleared.
- Sorry.

679
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:12,708
And yes...

680
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:17,875
That wasn't the only copy
of the video I had.

681
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:24,625
You want money, don't you?

682
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:26,292
Here you go.

683
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:35,417
But if Pratap finds out about Vikram,

684
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,458
it will be terrible.

685
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:37,583
Romila...

686
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:44,667
I get the feeling you can't quit
this high profile lifestyle now.

687
01:07:52,917 --> 01:07:54,250
Shall we?

688
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:06,333
I see you've turned
your room in your office.

689
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,375
Sorry, we couldn't
meet yesterday, son.

690
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:13,500
Romila cut her hand,
so I had to dash to the hospital.

691
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:16,458
I hope you understand, son.

692
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:20,375
We're attending Mr. Sharma's
daughter's wedding

693
01:08:20,542 --> 01:08:22,417
and will return as soon
as the wedding's over.

694
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,583
Okay.

695
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:25,417
We'll talk once I'm back.

696
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,792
Call Radhika.

697
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:47,333
Come here.

698
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,042
Sir, I'll just be back.

699
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:12,208
<i>The number you're trying</i>
<i>to call is currently unavailable.</i>

700
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:14,458
<i>To send a voicemail...</i>

701
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:16,208
Kaka.

702
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:21,833
Narang?

703
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:48,042
Vikram Kapoor!

704
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:24,333
Vikram!

705
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:28,875
Did you really think

706
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:32,625
you could kill me
with your cheap antics?

707
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,958
Shut down my shows, you...

708
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:41,250
Your shows? Your shows!

709
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:43,917
I made all this, Vikram.

710
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,083
The clients.

711
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:47,792
And Sarah.

712
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:50,375
You bribed Sarah over
to your side as well.

713
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,125
It's not the buyer's fault, Narang.

714
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:02,000
You should blame the seller.

715
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:05,583
- Take him away.
- You dog!

716
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:09,250
I will finish you!

717
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:31,667
Come here, scumbag!

718
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:33,917
Vikram!

719
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,208
Leave me!

720
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,292
I will finish you!

721
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:44,750
Scumbag!

722
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,250
I won't spare you.

723
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:52,208
I won't spare you.
Bastard!

724
01:23:01,167 --> 01:23:02,042
Shall we?

725
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:03,500
You dog.

726
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:28,750
This is what you wanted to see,
didn't you?

727
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,833
Is Vikram alright?

728
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:40,708
Narang.

729
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:47,500
Our good time will definitely
be a bad time for them.

730
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:23,458
Yeah.

731
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:05,875
Anybody there?

732
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:37,750
No, Narang!

733
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,208
No!

734
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,500
Jimmy.

735
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:22,000
We don't have much time.

736
01:38:22,333 --> 01:38:23,375
Hurry.

737
01:38:23,792 --> 01:38:25,542
Back there. Hurry.

738
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:16,292
Jimmy.

739
01:39:16,542 --> 01:39:17,375
What have you done?

740
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:19,792
Listen to me.

741
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:21,625
You killed her.

742
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:25,792
It wasn't intentional...

743
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:30,292
Jimmy.

744
01:39:30,875 --> 01:39:32,042
Listen to me.

745
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:35,958
- You... You killed her.
- Listen to me, Jimmy.

746
01:41:14,208 --> 01:41:15,458
Radhika?

747
01:41:17,292 --> 01:41:18,583
No, Radhika.

748
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,375
Vikram!

749
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:20,750
Are you alright?

750
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:27,333
Radhika...

751
01:42:37,917 --> 01:42:39,333
Why did you come back?

752
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,417
Turn the power back on.

753
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:13,917
Police.

754
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:15,417
Hurry up.

755
01:43:15,792 --> 01:43:16,667
Get out.

756
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,792
Get out of here.

757
01:43:27,042 --> 01:43:29,083
Stop. Where do you think you're going?

758
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,208
Ajit Charsi, you forgot to call me.

759
01:43:32,875 --> 01:43:33,833
What happened, sir?

760
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:35,875
Have you been hiding this man?

761
01:43:36,292 --> 01:43:37,917
No, sir. No, sir.

762
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:40,500
Take a good look.

763
01:43:41,458 --> 01:43:42,667
Oh yes, I remember it now.

764
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:44,167
This man left without informing me

765
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:45,458
and he didn't even pay.

766
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:49,917
- Hold him.
- Yes, sir.

767
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,125
Stand right here.

768
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:52,083
Don't move.

769
01:44:30,667 --> 01:44:32,458
Come on.

770
01:44:33,917 --> 01:44:36,875
I'll show you. Come on.

771
01:44:38,417 --> 01:44:41,208
- Take her.
- Don't you trust me anymore, sir?

772
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:43,167
- He was here, wasn't he?
- What are you looking for?

773
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:44,333
He was here, wasn't he?

774
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:46,708
Why are you hitting me?

775
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,625
There's nothing here.

776
01:44:49,042 --> 01:44:50,208
I said there's no one.

777
01:44:51,958 --> 01:44:52,958
He was here, wasn't he?

778
01:44:53,458 --> 01:44:54,417
Come on.

779
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:11,750
- Enough.
- Where is he?

780
01:45:12,292 --> 01:45:13,833
- Mr. Roy.
- Where is he?

781
01:45:13,917 --> 01:45:14,750
You know about my business.

782
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:16,208
- Where is he?
- Why are you hitting me?

783
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:17,208
Where?

784
01:45:19,792 --> 01:45:21,083
I'll tell you, sir.

785
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23,125
I'll tell you.

786
01:45:46,167 --> 01:45:48,375
You carry
unregistered bullets, don't you?

787
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:49,667
Sir...

788
01:45:55,167 --> 01:45:56,583
How about I shoot you with one?

789
01:45:57,625 --> 01:45:59,458
No, no...

790
01:46:01,083 --> 01:46:02,292
Just listen to me.

791
01:46:03,875 --> 01:46:05,167
I have something.

792
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:07,208
No, sir.

793
01:46:07,583 --> 01:46:09,250
I want to show you something.

794
01:46:09,833 --> 01:46:11,750
Please take a look.

795
01:46:13,792 --> 01:46:15,208
Yes, I was at the crime scene.

796
01:46:16,542 --> 01:46:19,500
But someone else was there, too.

797
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,042
<i>Vikram Kapoor!</i>

798
01:46:22,875 --> 01:46:25,208
<i>Narang told me</i>
<i>that Vikram had killed Sarah</i>

799
01:46:26,167 --> 01:46:28,333
<i>and I rushed to Sarah's home.</i>

800
01:46:30,375 --> 01:46:34,042
<i>But when I reached there,</i>
<i>I realized Sarah was alive.</i>

801
01:46:35,125 --> 01:46:36,250
<i>Then why...</i>

802
01:46:37,042 --> 01:46:38,750
<i>I was scared, sir.</i>

803
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:40,125
What are you doing?

804
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:43,583
- Listen to me, Sarah.
- Stop it.

805
01:46:43,667 --> 01:46:44,542
Sarah, please.

806
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:46,333
What are you doing?

807
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:51,542
There are no misunderstandings
between us, Sarah.

808
01:46:54,125 --> 01:46:55,417
I admit my mistake, Sarah.

809
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,917
Listen to me, Sarah. Please.

810
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,750
I'm a changed man now.

811
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:05,917
I am scared of you.

812
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,917
What?

813
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,125
Listen to me.

814
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:18,042
<i>Even I was surprised</i>
<i>to see Sarah alive</i>

815
01:47:18,292 --> 01:47:20,125
<i>and I wondered why</i>
<i>Narang called me there.</i>

816
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:22,625
<i>Was it to get his revenge</i>

817
01:47:23,042 --> 01:47:24,500
<i>or to set me up?</i>

818
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:26,167
Listen to me, Sarah. Please.

819
01:47:43,625 --> 01:47:45,042
Give Jimmy a chance, Sarah.

820
01:47:46,708 --> 01:47:49,292
Life and journey are
pretty much the same.

821
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:52,875
You never know
when they take an unexpected turn.

822
01:47:54,458 --> 01:47:55,542
Take care.

823
01:47:57,208 --> 01:48:00,333
<i>I came at Sarah's place to tell her</i>
<i>that Vikram had an accident.</i>

824
01:48:00,833 --> 01:48:02,375
<i>And then suddenly...</i>

825
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:04,708
<i>I heard a gunshot.</i>

826
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:06,625
<i>I ran inside and saw that...</i>

827
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:09,792
<i>I thought Sarah had shot herself.</i>

828
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,875
<i>Why would she do such a thing, sir?</i>

829
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:14,208
<i>Someone had shot Sarah.</i>

830
01:48:15,625 --> 01:48:17,292
<i>I went closer.</i>

831
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,375
<i>I was very scared.</i>

832
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:19,542
Sarah, wake up.
Sarah.

833
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:22,375
<i>But just then her guard</i>
<i>came and he saw me.</i>

834
01:48:23,208 --> 01:48:25,208
<i>- I was so afraid that I ran.</i>
<i>- Mr. Jimmy.</i>

835
01:48:25,542 --> 01:48:28,417
<i>While running out,</i>
<i>I noticed the CCTV camera.</i>

836
01:48:28,917 --> 01:48:31,125
<i>Mr. Jimmy, wait.</i>

837
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:34,667
I knew you would suspect me.

838
01:48:35,125 --> 01:48:37,042
That's why I stole the
footage from that camera

839
01:48:37,417 --> 01:48:43,667
and I saw the face of
the man who killed my Sarah.

840
01:48:49,333 --> 01:48:51,208
- Hey, look after him.
- Yes, sir.

841
01:49:23,667 --> 01:49:24,875
How do we get out of here now?

842
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:25,958
Who is he?

843
01:49:27,917 --> 01:49:29,333
Why is he trying to kill you?

844
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:31,042
I don't know.

845
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:33,458
I'll look for something.

846
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:37,667
The door.

847
01:50:04,875 --> 01:50:05,917
Radhika!

848
01:53:24,667 --> 01:53:26,917
No! No!

849
01:53:48,292 --> 01:53:49,667
Stop!

850
01:53:51,167 --> 01:53:52,500
I will shoot.

851
01:54:05,417 --> 01:54:06,500
Move back.

852
01:54:35,167 --> 01:54:36,208
Vikram.

853
01:54:38,083 --> 01:54:38,958
Are you okay?

854
01:54:50,542 --> 01:54:53,667
Jimmy showed me the CCTV
recording from Sarah's house...

855
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:57,333
and he saw Narang in the recording.

856
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:20,542
And also the face of the mastermind

857
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:23,792
behind this game.

858
01:55:32,958 --> 01:55:33,917
<i>Vikram.</i>

859
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:36,500
<i>Come to mom and dad.</i>

860
01:55:36,667 --> 01:55:38,167
Don't you want a picture?

861
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:41,167
Mom, I want a picture with uncle.

862
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,875
Vikram, go on.

863
01:55:46,208 --> 01:55:47,667
Pratap, why don't you join us too?

864
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,875
Pratap, how can you
even think like this?

865
01:55:53,458 --> 01:55:55,625
It's been only a couple of months
since your brother passed away...

866
01:55:56,417 --> 01:55:58,542
Nandini, you're still young.

867
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:00,500
And think about Vikram.

868
01:56:00,875 --> 01:56:01,875
Pratap!

869
01:56:09,375 --> 01:56:10,667
Uncle.

870
01:56:13,708 --> 01:56:15,625
Vikram's going to sleep
in uncle's room tonight.

871
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:49,083
Mummy!

872
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:58,500
Henceforth I am your dad,
not your uncle.

873
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:16,667
I am sorry, Vikram,
that you had to find out like this.

874
01:57:17,833 --> 01:57:21,000
But Pratap knew about
your fight with Jimmy.

875
01:57:21,542 --> 01:57:24,167
When you survived the accident
he had planned...

876
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:27,333
- Make it look like an accident.
- Okay.

877
01:57:30,292 --> 01:57:32,250
<i>Sir, the job's done,</i>

878
01:57:32,333 --> 01:57:33,625
<i>but Vikram survived the accident.</i>

879
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:35,792
<i>He's been taken to the hospital.</i>

880
01:57:42,042 --> 01:57:44,208
He made another plan to kill you.

881
01:57:52,958 --> 01:57:54,708
<i>That night, Bypass Road</i>

882
01:57:54,875 --> 01:57:57,542
<i>wasn't just Jimmy</i>
<i>and your destination.</i>

883
01:57:58,208 --> 01:58:00,292
<i>Narang, who's madly</i>
<i>in love with Romila</i>

884
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:03,083
<i>followed you all the way there.</i>

885
01:58:03,708 --> 01:58:07,458
<i>He saw Pratap murdering Sarah.</i>

886
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,792
<i>But Pratap was</i>
<i>unaware of this fact.</i>

887
01:58:13,292 --> 01:58:14,708
How long have you had this video?

888
01:58:16,958 --> 01:58:18,250
<i>Narang arrived at the right place,</i>

889
01:58:18,333 --> 01:58:19,583
<i>but at the wrong time</i>

890
01:58:20,167 --> 01:58:23,833
<i>to give you the money</i>
<i>and a copy of this video.</i>

891
01:58:24,125 --> 01:58:26,208
<i>Because he had understood</i>
<i>Romila's intentions.</i>

892
01:58:26,417 --> 01:58:29,750
<i>But fate had sent him</i>
<i>as your savior.</i>

893
01:58:31,958 --> 01:58:35,042
<i>We recovered all these items</i>
<i>from his body lying downstairs.</i>

894
01:58:35,375 --> 01:58:38,250
Your accident, Sarah's death,

895
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:42,000
Jimmy's disappearance
is not a coincidence.

896
01:58:42,958 --> 01:58:44,750
It was Pratap's plan all along.

897
01:59:04,917 --> 01:59:07,833
Mumbai Police need
intelligent officers like you.

898
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:10,667
- You're wasting your life in Alibaug!
- Pratap!

899
01:59:22,458 --> 01:59:24,667
Sarah shouldn't have called me.

900
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:35,125
Yeah, Sarah.

901
01:59:35,208 --> 01:59:36,250
Hello, Mr. Pratap.

902
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,125
Vikram's gun is with me.

903
01:59:38,833 --> 01:59:41,583
<i>Vikram wasn't answering my calls,</i>
<i>so I called you.</i>

904
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:45,708
If it stays here, I might use it.

905
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:47,125
<i>Please come and collect it.</i>

906
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:02,500
Thank you so much for coming.

907
02:00:10,458 --> 02:00:12,167
Vikram's met with an accident.

908
02:00:12,417 --> 02:00:13,625
Pratap just called.

909
02:00:15,875 --> 02:00:16,833
Vikram's accident?

910
02:00:17,042 --> 02:00:18,625
He said I should pick you up.

911
02:00:20,333 --> 02:00:22,875
But Mr. Pratap...

912
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:45,625
Sarah!

913
02:01:14,167 --> 02:01:15,792
Mr. Jimmy, wait!

914
02:01:58,292 --> 02:02:03,125
I always suspected
the ones I betrayed.

915
02:02:07,792 --> 02:02:09,625
But never imagined...

916
02:02:12,375 --> 02:02:13,833
it would be your face...

917
02:02:18,292 --> 02:02:19,625
behind this mask.

918
02:02:28,583 --> 02:02:29,417
Why?

919
02:02:33,792 --> 02:02:36,667
I had to kill your
mother for this money

920
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:41,250
and yet I need
your permission for it.

921
02:02:42,333 --> 02:02:46,750
Feels weird to beg to you.

922
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:50,042
My own son.

923
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:52,833
Even though you're my stepson.

924
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:56,167
I am a father, too.

925
02:02:56,292 --> 02:02:57,708
What to do?

926
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,292
I have a family, their needs,

927
02:03:00,375 --> 02:03:01,958
their requirements, their demands

928
02:03:02,042 --> 02:03:03,833
and expectations.

929
02:03:08,292 --> 02:03:10,333
And you're stubborn.

930
02:03:10,708 --> 02:03:13,917
You're stubborn
just like your mother.

931
02:03:23,292 --> 02:03:27,333
Mr. Roy, you were right.

932
02:03:30,375 --> 02:03:33,042
This last bullet has
someone's name written on it.

933
02:04:14,125 --> 02:04:15,333
Vikram.

934
02:04:15,958 --> 02:04:18,833
Romila was sure Pratap would kill you.

935
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:23,917
That's absurd.

936
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,500
She would use this video
as evidence and get Pratap arrested.

937
02:04:32,625 --> 02:04:33,500
You're being absurd.

938
02:04:34,833 --> 02:04:35,958
Because once you're gone,

939
02:04:36,042 --> 02:04:39,208
- Nandini would be the sole heir.
- That's not true.

940
02:04:41,208 --> 02:04:44,083
- You know me.
- Two birds with one stone.

941
02:04:44,167 --> 02:04:45,333
Listen to me.

942
02:04:47,292 --> 02:04:49,292
Concealing evidence is also a crime.

943
02:04:49,458 --> 02:04:50,875
- Take her away.
- Leave me.

944
02:04:51,042 --> 02:04:52,625
Vikram, think about Nandini.

945
02:04:52,708 --> 02:04:53,875
She needs a mother.

946
02:04:54,458 --> 02:04:55,333
Vikram.

947
02:04:55,417 --> 02:04:56,833
I am being framed,
I have done nothing wrong.

948
02:04:58,750 --> 02:05:00,750
- Get inside.
- I am the victim.

949
02:05:00,917 --> 02:05:02,417
- Let go. Vikram.
- Move!

950
02:05:15,458 --> 02:05:18,042
Sir, I need your signature
on the murder weapon report.

951
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:22,833
This is not a murder, Pandey.

952
02:05:24,917 --> 02:05:26,667
It's a case of self-defense.

953
02:05:36,417 --> 02:05:37,917
Take care, Vikram.

954
02:05:38,458 --> 02:05:39,708
And Nandini as well.

955
02:06:05,917 --> 02:06:07,167
Brother.

956
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:16,833
What for?

957
02:06:19,292 --> 02:06:22,167
For not understanding
your importance in my life.

958
02:06:24,958 --> 02:06:26,042
Nandini.

959
02:06:47,417 --> 02:06:48,750
<i>I never imagined that someday</i>

960
02:06:48,958 --> 02:06:51,042
<i>life will give me something</i>

961
02:06:51,583 --> 02:06:53,500
<i>I never asked for.</i>

962
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:39,917
<i>As the saying goes,</i>
<i>one who has no enemies,</i>

963
02:07:40,125 --> 02:07:42,125
<i>is disliked by his own family.</i>

964
02:07:44,417 --> 02:07:45,750
No, sir.

965
02:07:46,167 --> 02:07:49,042
You bought my silence
when you killed Ms. Nandini.

966
02:07:49,125 --> 02:07:50,500
But not this time.

967
02:07:50,875 --> 02:07:53,000
I know how this accident took place.

968
02:07:53,125 --> 02:07:55,542
<i>Pratap was the man</i>
<i>behind my accident</i>

969
02:07:55,917 --> 02:07:59,333
<i>and I found that out</i>
<i>at the hospital.</i>

970
02:07:59,667 --> 02:08:01,083
<i>In order to start the game,</i>

971
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:03,458
<i>I had to get out</i>
<i>of the hospital first.</i>

972
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:05,833
<i>After waking up,</i>

973
02:08:05,917 --> 02:08:07,917
<i>when I learned about Sarah's death,</i>

974
02:08:08,708 --> 02:08:10,208
<i>it made me restless.</i>

975
02:08:10,583 --> 02:08:12,250
<i>Jimmy called me at the hospital.</i>

976
02:08:12,333 --> 02:08:15,833
<i>He told me the truth</i>
<i>about Sarah's murder.</i>

977
02:08:16,083 --> 02:08:19,000
Can you send me
a copy of that video?

978
02:08:19,250 --> 02:08:20,583
<i>Not just deceit,</i>

979
02:08:20,833 --> 02:08:22,625
<i>I had a chance at</i>
<i>exacting my revenge.</i>

980
02:08:25,958 --> 02:08:27,542
You'll get discharged pretty soon.

981
02:08:28,083 --> 02:08:30,375
- I'll give this news to Pratap.
- No, doctor.

982
02:08:30,458 --> 02:08:33,125
<i>Before Pratap could</i>
<i>find out that I was fine...</i>

983
02:08:33,542 --> 02:08:35,375
My reports say that
I can no longer walk.

984
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:36,375
What?

985
02:08:36,458 --> 02:08:38,500
<i>I involved the doctor in my plan</i>

986
02:08:38,583 --> 02:08:41,083
<i>and got discharged</i>
<i>from the hospital.</i>

987
02:08:44,208 --> 02:08:45,542
Hello, Pratap.

988
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:50,375
<i>I was just a cripple</i>
<i>in everyone's eyes.</i>

989
02:08:50,792 --> 02:08:52,708
<i>But no one knew</i>

990
02:08:52,958 --> 02:08:57,208
<i>I was using my head</i>
<i>this time around.</i>

991
02:08:59,083 --> 02:09:00,125
<i>He was your friend, wasn't he?</i>

992
02:09:00,208 --> 02:09:02,417
<i>Before suspicion could fall upon me,</i>

993
02:09:02,625 --> 02:09:04,625
<i>it was important to convince Roy</i>

994
02:09:04,917 --> 02:09:06,208
<i>that I couldn't walk anymore.</i>

995
02:09:06,292 --> 02:09:08,875
<i>He was two steps ahead of me</i>
<i>at my own game.</i>

996
02:09:08,958 --> 02:09:09,833
Vikram!

997
02:09:09,917 --> 02:09:12,250
You're prone to accidents,
Mr. Vikram Kapoor.

998
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:17,500
<i>There was a character in this story</i>
<i>whom everyone knew,</i>

999
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:19,833
<i>but he knew everything.</i>

1000
02:09:21,167 --> 02:09:22,375
Hello, Jimmy.

1001
02:09:22,833 --> 02:09:24,750
Pratap has reported his gun stolen.

1002
02:09:25,417 --> 02:09:26,250
It's at your place,

1003
02:09:26,333 --> 02:09:27,958
and you must find it
before the police do.

1004
02:09:32,375 --> 02:09:33,833
Hello, Vikram.

1005
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:35,917
I've found the gun.

1006
02:09:37,292 --> 02:09:39,250
<i>To make my next move a success,</i>

1007
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:41,583
<i>Jimmy had to become</i>
<i>a prime suspect.</i>

1008
02:09:41,792 --> 02:09:44,167
<i>In this game of chess,</i>
<i>my victory was assured</i>

1009
02:09:44,708 --> 02:09:48,167
<i>because this time,</i>
<i>I was playing both sides.</i>

1010
02:09:51,417 --> 02:09:52,625
Vikram!

1011
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,875
It's time for Pratap
to find out, doctor.

1012
02:09:54,958 --> 02:09:56,417
Vikram's reports have
arrived from the US.

1013
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:58,125
If he finds out, I will recover,

1014
02:09:58,208 --> 02:10:00,125
he'll plan to kill me once again.

1015
02:10:00,208 --> 02:10:01,958
<i>Chances are</i>
<i>he might recovery completely.</i>

1016
02:10:07,792 --> 02:10:08,792
Vikram.

1017
02:10:09,458 --> 02:10:11,458
Provide backup power
to all the machines.

1018
02:10:11,542 --> 02:10:13,417
<i>I don't want our</i>
<i>personal differences</i>

1019
02:10:13,542 --> 02:10:15,833
<i>to cause harm to someone else.</i>

1020
02:10:16,250 --> 02:10:18,708
<i>Romila could never</i>
<i>understand my plan.</i>

1021
02:10:19,417 --> 02:10:21,958
<i>This was never</i>
<i>her plan in the first place.</i>

1022
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:29,542
Pratap has got his
opportunity today, Jimmy.

1023
02:10:31,333 --> 02:10:33,417
<i>I'll call Roy at the right time.</i>

1024
02:10:33,917 --> 02:10:36,708
<i>Just show him that CCTV footage.</i>

1025
02:10:38,708 --> 02:10:40,333
The moment he sees Pratap,

1026
02:10:40,625 --> 02:10:42,458
he'll rush here.

1027
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:45,417
<i>I want that gun at any cost.</i>

1028
02:10:53,875 --> 02:10:56,167
<i>It all ends tonight.</i>

1029
02:11:02,083 --> 02:11:04,167
<i>When you plan your own murder,</i>

1030
02:11:04,333 --> 02:11:05,625
<i>you don't expect to die,</i>

1031
02:11:05,917 --> 02:11:07,042
<i>you just kill.</i>

1032
02:11:07,917 --> 02:11:09,500
<i>Pratap killed my mother.</i>

1033
02:11:11,833 --> 02:11:14,583
<i>It wasn't a coincidence</i>
<i>that I got hold of his gun.</i>

1034
02:11:15,375 --> 02:11:16,958
<i>I planned it that way.</i>

1035
02:11:23,958 --> 02:11:25,208
Hello, Inspector Roy.

1036
02:11:25,333 --> 02:11:27,958
Ajit Charsi has been
hiding Jimmy Breganza.

1037
02:11:30,625 --> 02:11:33,583
<i>To come out of the trap</i>
<i>I had set up for myself,</i>

1038
02:11:33,875 --> 02:11:39,292
<i>I had to shoot Pratap</i>
<i>with his gun and convince Roy</i>

1039
02:11:40,042 --> 02:11:41,417
that it's a case of...

1040
02:11:42,917 --> 02:11:44,250
self-defense.

1041
02:11:52,958 --> 02:11:54,750
This is not a murder, Pandey.

1042
02:11:55,458 --> 02:11:56,958
It's a case of self-defense.
