Anyone who attacks from behind shoots it

17
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,082
He takes everyone, removes his head
He completes his throat

Translation from Bollywood Web site

28
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:07,827
You fool, you steal and run away?

29
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:11,869
Your dad will build your life
Are you betraying her with her?

00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,201
Do you have friendship with Mishra helicopter?

Listen, it was Miashra's gun
 What should I do on my head?

Daddy John, who disappeared in the last 3 months

34
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:30,769
Gupta

35
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,529
... If you do not listen to the prayers for three months, God

36
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you change your god

37
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,456
No, I'm sorry, this is not at all

38
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:47,040
It was a bad situation, I'm doing anything for you
Excuse me, I can not see you

39
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,737
Have you studied English for three months?

40
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:53,248
How is this possible? English?

41
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:56,400
Your dad is dying to educated people
... how much respect

42
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
You know Gupta this

43
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:58,854
Yes of course

44
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:01,280
Make sure you have a chance
Ask two questions

45
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,795
Two questions

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,120
What is the Taj Mahal?

47
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:09,717
Agra

48
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,207
Arifin Gupta

49
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:14,278
The second question

50
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,533
Do you have a ridge with a few rupees?

51
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,704
Three hundred crore?

52
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:27,400
If a builder wanted a theft like you
It would be so great

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,080
You make that time with 25

54
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:35,120
Do you have a degree, John?

55
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:39,270
I sent the king of the world from the grave and asked him

56
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,937
She said, "I'm dead."

57
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:45,440
I made 25 crore, let me sleep, please

58
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,641
Now I'm sending you to the king of the world

59
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,280
Go there, ask yourself

60
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:55,387

61
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,760

63
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:07,400
Gupou dear

64
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,801
Do you remember Caravagh today?

65
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:16,760
All your day is yours, but this one day
Is not your wife?

66
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:21,040
If Pato out of this

67
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,478

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,200

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,240
Come go out again

71
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,280
Sapna Dupe is the boss

72
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:34,400
I am my boss

73
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,080
Okay, your support is coming, he's going to go

74
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:55,349
Caravecate? Today I am alone

75
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,680
Why are you feeling upset
Control your self -

76
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:01,206
Gopu you go

77
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:06,157
I do not think so
Waitress -

78
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:09,640
Thank you, John, I always love you

79
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:15,280
Now you see what it's like

80
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:21,280
Seeing your dad, John, you have to go before him
Doctor ward

81
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:25,040
He is Dr. Bisigar

82
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:29,816

83
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,757
What happened to my dad?

84
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:36,462
Sit down

85
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:40,160
They are two years old who did not read

86
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,430
two years?
Yeah -

87
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:45,120

Laugh loud now

89
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,888
Sir, I'll laugh at this for 2 minutes

90
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:04,024
Sir this is your bullet and bullet. With
 Your bullet just happens

91
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,371
Go now

92
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,608
Whenever you see me you should be lazy

93
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,880
Sit down

94
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:15,582
You sat down

95
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:19,720
Who is sick

96
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,320
What disease do you take? Who is sick

97
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,440
Daddy dan

98
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,033
What is the master

99
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,960
Daddy John is feeling angry when hearing some of the things

100
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,520
what?
It makes you feel painful -

101
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,200
He pays the money he must take

102
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,400
Who needs to kill you

103
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,480
Because of this business we are in danger

104
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:46,520
No problems

105
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:50,120
Yes! Yes
Volt, so easy, no? -

106

Yes! Yes
Did I say right? -

107
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,120
Seven months

108
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:57,977
Seven minutes

109
00:08:58,235 --> 00:08:59,589
Seven o'clock

110
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:02,193
Seven minutes

111
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:05,720
It says the harmonic imbalance

112
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,297
Your dad, your life, these conditions sick

113
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:10,719
Instead of crying, laughing

114
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,980
That's what happened

115
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,880
... sometimes

116
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,566
Ask me for 20,000

117
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:17,905
Twenty thousand this

118

It's like this

120
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:26,040
No, I did not mean that

121
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,001
That's exactly for me

122
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,600
Let it happen

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,935
Daddy dan

124
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:32,356
Doctor Dr

126
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:37,961
Do not be afraid, these are different drugs for
 Different modes

127
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,880
You look at me

128
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,120
Do whatever you want

129
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Do it from the bottom of your heart
Do i do -

130
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:46,880
Yes sure

131
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,360
Really?

132
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,520
Saw, the doctor is telling you

133
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,000
Right now?

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,805
Do my dear, do it

135
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,232
Well then I'm doing it now

136
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:57,177
Daddy John has a good feeling

137
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:28,640
I said what you want to do, do what your hands do
Do not take meendo

138
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm comfortable with stress today

139
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I encountered myself, I saved myself

140
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,400
Doctor Hevrhta stresses, he sings the song

141
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,556
!Stress! the doctor

142
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:54,175
You dying

143
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,160
Accept my words

144
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,858
Go away, give it away, and cut it off

145
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:04,360
You are very good doctor

146
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,680
I introduce you everywhere

147
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,268
Wait my life, wait

148
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:11,880
Daddy John, listen

149
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:17,080
... Where does love come from? But everywhere it may be

150
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,480
This is not here

151
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:38,901
Bangles, Bangles
My diamond bangs

152
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:45,841
Tell my beloved, do not bother me

153
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:58,840
Bangles, Bangles
My diamond bangs

154
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,320
Tell my beloved, do not bother me

155
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,640
Since last June I have not talked about it

156
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,661
Come on, I'm tired of waiting

157
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:15,828
I kept open my sleeping eyes

158
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,871
... you

159
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,680
You are mine

160

Seeing you this sentimental heart

161
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:05,000
go to hell

162
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:12,353
Without you, the spring is fantastic

163
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:22,400
Make a compliment, let's join our hearts together
The link between you and you is definite

164
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:27,800
I kept open my sleeping eyes

165
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,760
My diamond bangs

166
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:41,547
Bring to my beloved do not annoy me

167
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:48,560
I talked to him since June
I did not go, I'm tired of waiting

168
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:54,960
I kept my sleepy eyes open

169
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:16,718
Give me your hand

170
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,320
I'm coming home

171
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,440
Behold, I can not live without you

172
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,960
Am i oxygen

173
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,138
For me, you have oxygen

174
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:34,560
... I smiled at you, danced with you

175
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,520
.... This does not mean that Sapna Dupe has believed her career

176
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,200
And give it away

177
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,280
I have a lot of work, I'm going

178
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,108
Go to Pinkie
sister-

179
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,040
what are you doing?

180
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,640
Eight months waiting for sister's husband

181
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,320
Who will come and get you

182
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,600
Now what's up, what do you do?

183
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,200
Pinkie! You do not know the marriage policy

184
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,760
... Now that I've come, I'm fine

185
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,961
... I get everything that I want

186
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,309
Then i go

187
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,840
Greeting
Live my daughter -

188
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:10,808
Have not you gone yet

189
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,920
Let's go

190
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
... Sapena ... me

191
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:17,254
Let's go my son

192
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:26,720
Kayal again, this day is revealed, O God

193
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:32,800
It does not look like anything today

194
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,920
Daddy John, you're welcome

195
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,080
You put me in front of all my little ones

196
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:43,240
I went to see my wife

197
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,779
I'm all small before

198
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,609
Did not accept his wife?

199
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,280
Did you go away?

200
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,480
Said you have come Did not you do anything

201
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,360
Where do you know where you say what he said?

202
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,867
Psychology tells you that something is happening

203
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,000
Come on, it's the habit of all the women

204
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I cry for a change in my body

205
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:16,034
Get the women out, they're creatures unknown

206
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,440
no no no. You do not understand
This is the problem of all women

207
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,640
But you said something about that
I pay tribute to you

208
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,240
You went and loved your wife
You voted

209
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,440
He did not accept
What does this prove?

210
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,240
You like him
I love it-

211
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:34,440
If you have a woman about her, okay
Friend if you can not

212
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:40,360
Excuse me, as the doctor said,
Wait a few days for her woman

213
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,309
Think sick and do not care about it

214
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:45,960
But what can you do?

215
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:48,360
The husband is the husband

216
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,589
I'm not talking about daddy
What should a husband do?

217
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:52,589
Daddy sit down

218
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,920
Look at the husband for a look

219
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,558
How do you feel about your wife?

220
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,040
How many months have you gotten your cartoon?

221
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,120
Do you like a woman?

222
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,720
Someone will tell you the good news, your wife
likes?

223
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,720
If your dignity diminishes, the woman will love her?

224
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,040
So then something else is done

225
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,438
The whole country knows you

226
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:15,120
Every attack and every street is just your poster

227
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,357
Do you know, don. Big don

228
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,256
Defeat the enemy

229
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:25,080
Defeat the enemy

230
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,640
It also takes the name of the cat

231
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:43,640
They are Helicopter Mishra

232
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,920
You have a purpose in life

233
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,880
End your dash administration

234
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,800
He rules himself to Varanasi

235
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,280
Mishra helicopter does not lift, he raises the rest

236
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:06,840
Respect me

237
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,885
Get the paperwork you want to sign

238
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:12,080
We can not sell this land

239
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,800
About our land and our destiny, we just gave her the decision

240
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:22,720
Kidding

241
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,560
Time is dead, John is dead, now is the time
 The helicopter is mythical

242
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:27,585
Your dad will decide

243
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,077
let's go?

244
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:36,675
Bollywood Van Talking Telegram

My next movie has at least 500 crore profits

253
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,760
Five hundred crore?

254
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,860
It's a trade

255
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:09,379
It talks about a thousand crimes

256
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:12,092
I know we're kidding for a thousand crimes, which one?

257
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,080
I do not know, investigate it

258
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,680

263
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,800
Watch my dad for the kids, three-dimensional
And that's brash

264
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Hey listen

265
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:05,920
Do you understand this phone?

266
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:12,040
Do you know what your dear Time is calling, then call

267
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,200
Okay, I'll call for a few more minutes

268
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:18,629
where were we?

269
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,810

what happened? What does he say?
I do not know -

275
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,908
How stupid did you say two hours later

276
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:42,680
She said she did not know when the director came back

277
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:43,753
Sorry

278

Do something, get my money back

Make a check

Mona is a long time following this director

287
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,752
From that time on, it just cuts off the phone

288
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:24,920
Give the phone, I'm talking to him

289
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,200

Yes daddy

294
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,040
I am a jerk

295
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,240
I will not make a 3D movie

296
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,610

My daddy was telling the move ... You came here too

335
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:54,480
Come here, dear director

336
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:59,320
You walked in the city with Inver Overnight car

337
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:02,800
Today, go to the traditional way

338
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:09,200
What is your life for this life?

339
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:12,101
Man is a moment, it was a moment

As it was yesterday in Bombay, you are here tomorrow
You are astmona

341
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:23,317
Hey, I do not scare you with this

342
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:26,823
I made the same black scenes, did you know?

343
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:28,715

345
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:35,530
Come on, I know, you're all in prison

346
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:39,040
What sound was this from behind?

348
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:48,580

How many times did I tell you after we killed someone?
Do not challenge your own land

350
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:55,000
Put it in the water

351
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:57,200
Who is this miserable?

352
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:02,400
This is a niche

353
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,537
Your face is broken, look right

354
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:10,440
Challenge everyone, call your name

355
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:12,607
Which one to understand

356
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:15,474
Come see her watch

357
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,233

No, not this bitch, Colonel Maturue

360
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:26,640
What was your director dear, did you want to talk to?

361
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:28,400
Come talk straight away

362
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,320
Mr. Dadash John Turdi, you do not need this

363
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
You get involved with me this problem

364
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,413
Just a thought, about the smurf

365
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:39,400
You should not be dragging a little something like this one

366
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,840
Daddy dan

367

00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
what is this?

371
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:55,960
Two questions

372
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:57,631
The first question

373
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,680
Amitab Chikara Abishik?

374
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,446
It's easy

375
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,240
Amitab Bachchan, Abishik's father

376
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:11,571
The second question

377
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:16,240
Amitab, chikare amitab?

378
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:19,280
This is what the question is! Not a question at all

379
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
The question is true

380
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,930
I am answering this, Amitab, the name of Amityab

381
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:29,240
That question was rejected

382
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,480

That's wrong

388
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,280
I know and you ask me two questions

389
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:54,936
I'm answering two questions right now

390
00:26:54,936 --> 00:26:56,480

So what about me?

394
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:03,386
You do not understand

395
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:06,406
Take a picture with such a famous director

401
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,049

Nothing, your trusted agent

This weakness loves him

426
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:19,800
Can i take a picture?

427
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,880

00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:34,671
Can you get it

435
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,456
Present?

436
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,028
What is your disadvantage?

437
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:42,037
She is a confidante

438
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:46,880
You know when filming Salman Khan from
Psychologically, one problem was found

439
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:50,280
I'm looking for my doctor

440
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,546
Salman Khan?

441
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,904
Salman Khan himself?
From Kay Salman Khan -

442
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,540
No, I mean, I mean

443
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,520
I heard a lot of complaints

444
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,760
You say, what's your problem

445
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:04,398
.... you know

446
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:07,515
Tell me, doctor, I can cure him

447
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,930
I can not say
Let's say

448
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,549
Is a confidante

449
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,632
Confidential

450
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:18,626
Sir, finish this game confidentially

451
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,240
Open it sir

452
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,320
Are you all here Is not it strange?

453
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:31,120
... The main cause of the illness was John Bridney

454
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:34,520
The woman is dead

455
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:52,880
The director has arrived sooner

456
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,520
If I knew, we wanted 3-4 additional craters

457
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,258
What do you say, I do not have the money

458
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:01,547
I'm hungry and dressed. Everything I get is here

459
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:05,880
The reason is that I can not make a movie now

460
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:09,800
what film?

461
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,092
It was a romance story

462
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:12,902
Couple story

463
00:30:14,115 --> 00:30:17,680
A skeptic woman and an innocent husband

464
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,834
The woman wounds her and goes away

465
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:24,440
Eight years of marriage, the wind fades

466
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:26,117
What's the use now?

467
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:34,323
Seven months

468
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:37,600
Sapena went to me and gone

469
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,531
Did your wife and welton

470
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:44,562
You and my story are like you

471
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,567
What's next

472
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:48,880
That's what it should be

473
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,496
Sorry

474
00:30:50,496 --> 00:30:52,243
Woman finds out her mistake

475
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:53,720
She goes to her husband

476
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,920
Crying, begging

477
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,120
He goes to spray and apologizes

478
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,600
An innocent husband also brings him

479
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,400
Happy Ending

480
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,200
This is a movie story

481
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,040
You will not be like that

482
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,085
No, you can not die

483
00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:08,316
Ok do not accept

484
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:11,270
If I have your story

485
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,160
I'll show you a glimpse of it
The woman she had not seen before

486
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,477

487
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:22,040
Do not show all this to you?

488
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,680
He finds out his mistake

489
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,293
Will or not

490
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:28,800
Sapena does not do this

491
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,720
Why does not she

492
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:34,951
Really?
Sure-

493
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,240

00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,188
Sixty one crore
Excessive

496
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,200
What are you doing

497
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,800
Back to Sapna?

498
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,987

499
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,934

500
00:31:58,411 --> 00:31:59,972
Take these 11 crimes for consideration

501
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:03,092

513
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:36,480

But the part of this will change very soon

528
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,240
The quest for this will be much more

529
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:25,520

00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,073
No, it's a lie

563
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:17,935
This is a lie, she was a good film, she liked it

Okay, daddy, I'll go

O God, if you know Dad about Don and do not know about Dad

With the Minister of Political Affairs

This decision can only take it

629
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,161
The result of thinking and deciding you is not my essence

630
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,000
The result is in line with our decisions

631
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,440
How valuable is this palace?

632
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,241
Sir, at least 7 million crore

633
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:15,840
What do you say buddy

634
00:40:16,092 --> 00:40:19,440

Baba, we need to write the script

636
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:23,800
Let's write the script that you can not write here
Look at the palace

637
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:28,206
Did you write a good scene?
Right now he defined a good scene -

638
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,400
Really?
There was a scene in your home -

639
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,520
What's up with the Hindus?
Home -

640
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:38,720
... you're at home in the morning

641
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
... birds are singing

642
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,440
... The sun is coming up

643
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,160
... the color of the whole orange ozonation

644
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:50,964
... think, my wife, Sapna

645
00:40:50,964 --> 00:40:53,471

646
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:55,304
... with an orange sari

647
00:40:55,304 --> 00:40:57,520
His hand is coconut and he's walking

648
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,800
Coconut

649
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:04,600
... The coconut that you have in the tray of prayer

650
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,800
Going to your feet

651
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,760
My foot?

God are you

654
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:23,299
Is Sapena doing that?

655
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:26,080
It does not matter

656
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,961
What a lovely scene

657
00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:30,680
How much do you want?

658
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:32,410
Uncle

665
00:41:50,756 --> 00:41:54,447
I wanted to ask you how you and your wife were from
Separated?

666
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:02,680
It was a very bad day

667
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:09,400
Stephanie, you helped us

668
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,320
Caused Sapna's misconception

669
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:17,840
Sapena, you made a mistake
Sapnaaa

670
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:23,360
I do not wanna be widowed

671
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,280
For this very healthy year

672
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,405
I'm not mistaken

673
00:42:31,405 --> 00:42:35,824
I'm still not a mother, I'm so good for you

674
00:42:37,418 --> 00:42:39,200
Stephanie

675
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
You're wrong

676
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:42,481
... Stephanie's husband

677
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:46,280
That jeoparded me for my sake

678
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,064
Because of that, I am here now here
I am happy and happy

679
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:49,471
... think now

680
00:42:49,496 --> 00:42:53,363
.... you and me

681
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,598
I understand these assumptions very well

682
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:57,040
 Stephanie is friends

683
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,069
.... so much so that you

684
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,526
You wanted to make that foreigner out of this house

685
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:09,320
You wanted to do it to me

686
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,538
Repent repentance

687
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:15,600
What do you say, you fall asleep like that
I could not do it

688
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:20,200
Do you remember the early marriage of Sapna?

689
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,600
You always asked, I'm cumming?

690
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,320
Where do I go, when will I go?

691
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,120
What am I doing for you?

692
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,405
I defined you for my work

693
00:43:30,397 --> 00:43:32,760
How much did you like me

694
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,041
Not

695
00:43:35,494 --> 00:43:36,494
It was doubtful

696
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,200
I always doubted you

697
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,160
You're skeptical

698
00:43:44,462 --> 00:43:46,261
...O God
What else? -

699
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,080
Now I'm sick?

700
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,220
That girl, what's up?

701
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:56,571
I can not stand it again

702
00:43:56,571 --> 00:44:00,390
Everything is fine, you do not trust your husband

703
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,920
Do not you trust

704
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,920
Talk to me and what else you have

705
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
What's the good thing Han

706
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:08,680
Well then I'm not using it anyway

707
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:10,507
Sapena is coming

708
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,920
you got it?
I did not mean that-

709
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,466
!I did not mean that

710
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:16,529
.... sapnaaaaa

711
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:25,295
Sapena

712
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:33,560
Brother
She's gone, why are you crying? -

713
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,920
I felt sentimental
What is the emotion -

714
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:39,920
... Daddy ... My wife, Sapna

715
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
Stop daddy

716
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:58,411
Daddy John Wonderful

717
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,560
Mishra helicopter, you must have heard my name

718
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,560
Yeah i heard

719
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:04,656
You went too high upstairs

720
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:08,040
But what's up there, Yeah
Did you come to this day today?

721
00:45:08,048 --> 00:45:11,160
What would I tell you if he wanted John a few years ago
 Like you somebody

722
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,000
Now, I've become bigger than you
Today i am juluto

723
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,335
So big to see me here?

724
00:45:18,535 --> 00:45:22,600
And you're new to bending and respecting me?

725
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:30,120
What do i say Son of a friend, respect
I learned the older from childhood

726
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,370
I was a simple man, I changed my life

727
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:38,065
Without medication, and in the hospital, I will get the name of God

728
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,000
 Little by little, I learned a very important subject

729
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,600
... that if the world has something worthwhile

730
00:45:44,936 --> 00:45:46,440
That pile

731
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,920
You know, John, I've got a rupee, too
I can bear it

732
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,280
Then you lost your life to 70 crore

733
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
... I'm for my money

734
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,320
I can bend and bend the rest

735
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,640
They need to be horizontal

736
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,040
Do not you wise

737
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,520
How many times have you told me, in the middle of the letter?

738
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,280
I'm talking, blond guy, he's getting it

739
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:09,733
Fool

740
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,858
... I know it's so shameful

741
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:16,560
... if that land that you named yourself

742
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,400
I can not get back to you

743
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,200
If you were so big a name

744
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:25,480
It was not necessary to go back to Gupta

745
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,253
If I am the head of this

746
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,735
I'm not going to leave you in two steps

747
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,760
... hahahaha

748
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,880
Try to understand

749
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,071
That you understand something to others
First you must be wise

750
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:13,853
Intagram Bollywood Van
@ Bolly1official

751
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:27,080
Remember Goddess

752
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:31,960
Give the name of your mind

753
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:36,480
Watch out for us

754
00:47:38,777 --> 00:47:45,847
Remember the goddess, remember the name of the goddess
Take care, take care of us

755
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,720
If it's God's shank

756
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,881
Hey goddess

757
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:58,472
One and only one hundred and one

758
00:47:58,564 --> 00:48:03,760
I want to know more about you

759
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:10,160
Someone who miracles you, you guys

760
00:48:36,286 --> 00:48:38,960
When your blood is in your current vein

761
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,960
Adam will be like kings

762
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,379
The soul will reappear again

763
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,920
Like a king

764
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,040
When to quarrel

765
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,400
Out of the eyes comes out fire

766
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,720
You are attacked from the four sides

767
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,110
Ears are torn when you call her

768
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:08,435
Wait another day, do not go from here

769
00:49:08,435 --> 00:49:13,280
You go, then stop him

770
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,880
I accepted that

771
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,680
Why do not you accept?

772
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,495
You are against the whole world

773
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,320
The day I got in the Ganga River

774
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,920
My whole body stretched out

775
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,360
The way things are done

776
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:16,920
The whole city knows me as a psychologist, but
They make a mistake

777
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,120
Sapna Dupe

778
00:52:20,322 --> 00:52:23,680
Homecoming ghetto

779
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,993
Here and there, the road to fights, but when you go
The poor will change completely

780
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:31,687
It's the same for me

781
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:36,120
Look what happens to you, because of your husband

782
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,320
When you go, you think the camera is hidden

783
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,184
Suspicious talk, marble nights

784
00:52:43,184 --> 00:52:46,160
Foreign hands around her hair

785
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,760
Namely, you got stuck at home

786
00:53:04,372 --> 00:53:06,680
Hello Goddess

787
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,880
Why are you so tired?

788
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,480
what has happened?
It's all because of these hackers

789
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,800
I understand, I found a supplier for this

790
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,920
One that has a lot of money

791
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
That is a strange name, they have died

792
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:28,795
He has a lot of money, so if you give him two crates, tell him 6 crore

793
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:32,880
Later channeled, 25% down

794
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,200
Once again, you will get the money that we will divide

795
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:42,720
There is a little problem, he is

796
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,720
Do not you

797
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:49,680
I'm impressed by your story, you're a lover
You are real

798
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,800
Husband are very effective in returning a woman

799
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,120
You are making films, how romantic they are

800
00:53:57,198 --> 00:54:01,872
Why do not you play the first role?

801
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:06,096
Very handsome, handsome

802
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:08,306
What better way to play this game

803
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:10,200
You are awesome

804
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,600
I like Sapna very much

805
00:54:13,772 --> 00:54:16,160
I can not make love to her

806
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,302
Dada, you speak like God

807
00:54:19,302 --> 00:54:22,680
I play this movie, I'm playing the movie

808
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,794
We found the actress

809
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:28,320
Okay Malice Let's talk about your wages

810
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,120
How much do you want for this movie?

811
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,720
Who was talking about money for you now?

812
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,320
I'll give you a special discount

813
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,105
Only 9 crore

814
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:42,000
What
Enough, it's just a little 9 crore-

815
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:20,640
Give her a pillow

816
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,640
Come on eat, everything is fine

817
00:55:26,704 --> 00:55:31,240
In fact, it's the doctor's pill to make love to with his wife
... gave him

818
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,840
Lucky is wrong, he has already lost his pill

819
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:36,800
It's one, nine, three

820
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,560
Daddy John felt good

821
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,760
And that marmalican mosque used to do this

822
00:56:00,709 --> 00:56:03,920
Come on and touch me

823
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:13,284
What does the car make, what does it do here? To
 What have you come

824
00:56:13,322 --> 00:56:16,520
what has happened?
If you come here, it will burn all over

825
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:22,520
Come and make your dreams come true

826
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,054
Come to my arms

827
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,760
Your wife is here! You did not tell me

When I'm upright, I'm not lying

Whatever you say, you tell it, apart from the truth
You say something

996
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:57,414
You are a nonsense writer

Hey, we're hard at work, all we have to say is silent

1001
01:14:12,082 --> 01:14:16,000

01:14:16,884 --> 01:14:19,466
why are you laughing? Fine, go

01:19:01,293 --> 01:19:04,240
Hey, you can say goodbye, you do not get a good dialogue

1063

But you're not good at all

1082
01:21:02,798 --> 01:21:05,320
This is an unlucky suit
Disloyalty?-

Listen to something else I did not come to see you
I did not come to see the filming

1088
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:35,880
I've come to see you make your movie a hero once
I'm evil

1089
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:42,480
Your wife is not evil, you are the goddess of God

1090
01:21:43,644 --> 01:21:44,644

1093
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,613
I am the parony of the ear
I'm Goddie

1094
01:21:55,613 --> 01:21:59,409
Yes, Mr. Goldie Kapoor, I'm on my side

Okay, tell me what the scene is and Sapna DuPa
 You want to do

The woman has a good dialogue
Look at her brother's wife here.

1099
01:22:13,977 --> 01:22:19,365
In the Ganges River you will drive two boats

1100
01:22:19,365 --> 01:22:22,931
You are one of us, and you are one of them, John, you tried
It gets you

1101
01:22:22,931 --> 01:22:25,320
No, no, no such thing happened at all

Dunbar Paron

1103
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,320
My dun paron

1104
01:22:31,561 --> 01:22:34,120
It was not so
So how was that? -

1105
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,521
It was such ... how was it?

1106
01:22:38,591 --> 01:22:41,289
... I do not know if he gave me a reminder or not

1107
01:22:42,429 --> 01:22:43,704
... how is it possible?

1108
01:22:45,339 --> 01:22:47,320

Do you remember Celebration of color

1110
01:22:54,023 --> 01:23:03,240
Hey Mona, the time you did not have a gun
I lit a cigar with a bullet

1111
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,960
Looks like you do not like yourself

1112
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,360
I love your daughter so much

1113
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:17,360
Or give it to me, or take me off

1114
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:26,574
Let me take you later, first tell me my daughter
Have you accepted

1115
01:23:26,574 --> 01:23:29,920
We did not think we would get your permission first, that's his lifetime

1116
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:37,403
He intends to first of all take great pleasure
Later we will meet it

1117
01:23:39,254 --> 01:23:42,360
If that answer is rejected?
We force it-

1118
01:23:44,757 --> 01:23:50,120
He's going to get the bride
The first answer is yes and your good prayer

1119
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:58,040
I just sneezed, I did not say anything

1120
01:23:59,906 --> 01:24:02,400
I really liked your confidence

1121
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,800
... I'm so glad on my behalf

1122
01:24:08,754 --> 01:24:09,754
The answer is yes

1123
01:24:18,092 --> 01:24:22,911
Father, if your answer is yes, why do not you go with it?
I?-

1124
01:24:24,612 --> 01:24:28,760
Where do you look at your dad? Answer it
What this answer is

1125
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,360
I answer

1126
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:34,440

Ignorant ignorant

1129
01:24:44,178 --> 01:24:47,280
I do not marry the ignorant sailor

1130
01:24:47,563 --> 01:24:52,000
My husband and I have to come together, completely English

1131
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,160
I get married with an educated person

1132
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,760
Go away, do not go with you
Do not you? -

1133
01:24:58,772 --> 01:25:04,720
Hey, my daughter is completely right, go away

1134
01:25:05,665 --> 01:25:07,600
Hear it or not, spit it out

1135
01:25:16,089 --> 01:25:22,080
Little stars are flashing, I'm Terti

Who is the director, who is the man who dreams this way?

1147
01:26:44,403 --> 01:26:51,517
That's wrong, this guy thought to be Dickish

1148
01:26:51,571 --> 01:26:53,768
Beautiful
What a beautiful thing Man must be

1149
01:26:55,596 --> 01:26:58,440
I'm gonna waste my time

1150
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:06,480
I swear by God that you have a blind eye

1151
01:27:08,322 --> 01:27:12,520
I want to live in your eyes

1152
01:27:19,382 --> 01:27:27,560
I swear by God that you have infinite eyes
I want you to live in my eyes

1153
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:36,360
My heart wants to stay here

1154
01:27:37,353 --> 01:27:41,720
I'm drowning the whole day

1155
01:27:41,969 --> 01:27:48,080
Your eyes make me crazy

1156
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:24,480
Look, tonight tonight to Pasta

1157
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:30,120
Think that it's Diwaliyah tonight

1158
01:28:35,044 --> 01:28:46,240
Without you I do not want to miss a moment
you are my world

1159
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:51,600
Your color has astonished me

1160
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,981
I'm drowning the whole day

1161
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:29,370
Ok, it's over

1162
01:29:30,015 --> 01:29:33,702
We run the body scene, bring a corpse

1163
01:29:34,726 --> 01:29:35,996
The body wants

1164
01:29:43,787 --> 01:29:44,960
I murdered him

1165
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:51,280
say
Daddy Jaysi, the director wants a body

1166
01:29:51,314 --> 01:29:55,400
What I killed the one just now

1167
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,702
Afterwards
Okay, I'm going

1168
01:29:58,592 --> 01:30:05,160
Let's take it, people, when they are not filming
Then you were tormented by your death

1169
01:30:10,106 --> 01:30:13,441
In the last 10 minutes, this person has not changed his heart

1170
01:30:14,172 --> 01:30:18,971
What is a pledge, then cumulate the video

1171
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:22,241
In the next movie, I give her a dead role, with a dialogue

1172
01:30:23,361 --> 01:30:27,720
I took that number a long time ago
The new director wants to get the number

1173
01:30:27,745 --> 01:30:28,745
Does not know

1174
01:30:40,998 --> 01:30:47,424
My daddy, my friend, is a penny
Is here now

1175
01:30:48,641 --> 01:30:50,920
what to do now?
I do not know-

1176
01:30:54,779 --> 01:30:57,524
Do not stop filming
Why shut down? -

1177
01:30:57,568 --> 01:31:01,240
Outside the police
Okay, we're letting the video go

1178
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:04,920
... have permission, but that corpse
I know it is hana

1179
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:09,320
It's the body of the corpse
His job is to make money, which is a corpse.

1180
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:12,320
Shut your dad
What to shut up do not shut up--

1181
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:16,480
You're crazy to say that you are mad. Actor, that's fine
He plays the role

1182
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,760
Hey shut up

1183
01:31:21,228 --> 01:31:22,228
stand up

1184
01:31:23,007 --> 01:31:25,393
Look at him

1185
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:31,960
I was impressed, you will play the next movie
With the dialogue

1186
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,674
OK? Now finish the game

1187
01:31:38,314 --> 01:31:41,840
That fellow. is dead

1188
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:43,371
Take it from here

1189
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:57,306
We saved him. What did your body do?
I put it in an old car

1190
01:31:57,331 --> 01:31:58,331
I see

1191
01:31:59,193 --> 01:32:05,521
What what have you done? Have you thrown a car in the car of the commissar?

1192
01:32:24,599 --> 01:32:31,320
Elo
This time it was just water, next time it might be acid-

1193
01:32:32,933 --> 01:32:35,243
Who is talking
I do not know-

1194
01:32:35,268 --> 01:32:36,268
Lucky

1195
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:44,072
Good luck you saved this time
... Daddy will give you John. Otherwise

1196
01:32:44,072 --> 01:32:51,480
Watch the movie or else you will find your body

1197
01:32:59,326 --> 01:33:01,576
I'm filming

1198
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:11,600
He was talking like a chain killer. I'm terrified
Did you cut off the phone or I'll cut it off

1199
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,520
O God, the phone is cut off or your neck

1200
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,240
Dada was a beautiful dialog

1201
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:22,040
! The woman is afraid of dry skin, you think of a dialogue

1202
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,718
shame on you
you do not worry-

1203
01:33:23,743 --> 01:33:28,897
My dad is knowing, it's the job of someone
Will not be forgiven

1204
01:33:31,113 --> 01:33:33,517
The wife of Dadash Sapena. please come

1205
01:33:34,353 --> 01:33:38,400
Mrs. Malice is very upset, but she should come

1206
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,960
Because Dupe has a lot of enemies

1207
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,222
what do you mean?

1208
01:33:42,222 --> 01:33:49,240
Someone may attack him at any one time
It's always your knife in your pocket

1209
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,870
Goldie

1210
01:33:50,895 --> 01:33:57,520
The right woman tells her that everyone is near her
At any moment, it may be gone forever

1211
01:33:57,617 --> 01:34:01,121
Max, Madan, Moan, Morley
Shut up Lucky-

1212
01:34:01,146 --> 01:34:04,280
!what has happened? Why are you afraid of Malice?

1213
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:07,880
My name starts with M, Malika

1214
01:34:09,505 --> 01:34:10,505
Goldie

1215
01:34:23,277 --> 01:34:28,440
I was very stressed here
But now that's fine here

1216
01:34:30,127 --> 01:34:34,360
Mrs. Malice, do not worry, I've come to sit again

1217
01:34:36,805 --> 01:34:37,805
Hello

1218
01:34:39,049 --> 01:34:40,049
Hello

1219
01:34:41,859 --> 01:34:45,960
Do you know when he rang?
We are trying hard to stop the phone from answering.

1220
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:50,000
We are afraid that someone will threaten the Dupean family
Okay

1221
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,143
We'll solve it first, understand who it is who is us
Annoying

1222
01:35:00,275 --> 01:35:04,406
The renowned Utopian, his dad John Teredy
The movie is made

1223
01:35:04,858 --> 01:35:12,545
Now he's dying to give you a great gift,
Your name is a helicopter, that bitch is flying

1224
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:16,360
Stop it! Your dad John Dadish John

1225
01:35:16,366 --> 01:35:18,280
My ear filled with his name

1226
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:22,720
The bitch also has the name of the offender who is going forward
Going

1227
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:27,720
I do not destroy it, I'm not a Mishra helicopter

1228
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:31,360
Chowtha, go and kill his female actress and bring him here

1229
01:35:36,757 --> 01:35:39,880
who is it?
Bob says Tridy

1230
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:44,520
Mishra, do you want to kill my actor?

1231
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,720
Do you want to close my movie?

1232
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:53,147
Catch the phone, my idiot is the head of your every single person
Separating

1233
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:56,400
I will not live

1234
01:35:57,837 --> 01:35:58,837
Cut off

1235
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,036
But heard the whole thing again?

1236
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:01,935
He heard

1237
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:06,360
Do not miss it, darling
Frightened

1238
01:36:06,735 --> 01:36:09,697
Who was who What is the phone?

1239
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:13,228
Get your phone on
My dad is all over

1240
01:36:16,126 --> 01:36:20,120
I'm thinking of something, I've got John on that side
How do you know?

1241
01:36:22,393 --> 01:36:24,719
Do not be afraid, darling, there was no chance at all
Call

1242
01:36:26,039 --> 01:36:28,640
It was not the time for the call, the phone was all silent

1243
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:32,240
Well then, where did I find out what I think of?

1244
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:38,205
Relax.
... I mean, I think of something,

1245
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:39,033
no no no

1246
01:36:40,829 --> 01:36:44,770
I do not think - you think
I do not think anymore

1247
01:36:48,963 --> 01:36:50,760
Hello my dad

1248
01:36:51,807 --> 01:36:56,840
Help our dad, we are the family of the soldier
We are the army

1249
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:02,400
We all gave the martyr country
This is the son of this brother

1250
01:37:02,844 --> 01:37:04,600
!My husband

1251
01:37:06,326 --> 01:37:11,520
Everything the Earth gave us, Mishra helicopter force
Took us from

1252
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,932
We tried hard to fight the enemies in the country

1253
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:18,320
But we lost this battle

1254
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,862
I respect the army more than anyone else

1255
01:37:21,862 --> 01:37:26,200
And an army will never fail

1256
01:37:42,861 --> 01:37:45,496
Hey Mishra, see who is here

1257
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:54,400
I will not go anywhere without inviting you, if I go, it looks like you

1258
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:59,920
Why did I come until I told her why
Can not breathe

1259
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:00,920
Like you

1260
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,480
Mishra breathe, sit down

1261
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:11,640
Daddy John, you are our guest, what can I do?
To do you

1262
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:16,040
I just want the plots of the widows

1263
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,840
Why are your dad guilty of looking for these widows?

1264
01:38:21,988 --> 01:38:25,680
I heard that for the sake of a widow, the wife of her husband sent you

1265
01:38:26,726 --> 01:38:31,325
Now you are looking for this widow, think
! What does the woman do?

1266
01:38:40,361 --> 01:38:43,200
Oh, Miashra jokes

1267
01:38:45,051 --> 01:38:47,680
I did not say that

1268
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:51,085
You do not know the woman you give Sapna

1269
01:38:51,827 --> 01:38:59,960
If my daddy suppena understands that you made me joke with me
You are every single bare alley you rotate

1270
01:39:01,983 --> 01:39:07,142
Oh, oh, do not be here, look
no it's not-

1271
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,284
To say this is a joke

1272
01:39:11,557 --> 01:39:12,557
You're so funny

1273
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:16,960
Give me the sanda

1274
01:39:16,989 --> 01:39:17,989
come and get it

1275
01:39:18,014 --> 01:39:20,680
One joke to be happy, sign up

1276
01:39:27,138 --> 01:39:33,081
Do you know the price of this land?
A project of seven hundred cores

1277
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:36,080
Why do not you bother yourself?

1278
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:44,000
See how much the widows land
Double it

1279
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,520
You know, John, you and I can go to Varanasi
We rule

1280
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,800
Take my hand and see for yourself

1281
01:39:53,901 --> 01:39:55,960
Mishra is very smart

1282
01:39:56,357 --> 01:39:57,935
What did you suggest?

1283
01:39:59,947 --> 01:40:03,120
But I have to ask you two questions

1284
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,864
Ask ok, what's the fear for what?

1285
01:40:05,891 --> 01:40:09,360
Question 1: Who is the King of the Forest?

1286
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,840
Lion

1287
01:40:15,105 --> 01:40:16,105
Adrian was very good

1288
01:40:17,049 --> 01:40:22,400
Second Question: What is the lowest of the world?

1289
01:40:24,743 --> 01:40:28,000
How are you?
Man-

1290
01:40:30,067 --> 01:40:32,000
A man like you

1291
01:40:36,576 --> 01:40:39,760
Is this your life? Insulting

1292
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:03,120
Long live the moon

1293
01:41:38,265 --> 01:41:43,480
The camera comes out here, it's a good shot

1294
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:46,880
Do you shoot me the shot?

1295
01:41:46,908 --> 01:41:49,481
Let's take one or two of my beautiful scene

1296
01:41:50,528 --> 01:41:51,863
A moment

1297
01:41:55,411 --> 01:42:00,390
Yes?
Director, shut this movie

1298
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:11,337
Otherwise, I will tick and you will be in the alley of Varanasi
Do you think

1299
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:19,651
Again, if I'm alive, I'm not bulletproof, with a bomb
Exploding

1300
01:42:19,651 --> 01:42:23,000
just a moment
Explode

1301
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,560
Who is talking
Hello, my dear John-

1302
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,160
Sorry
! Lucky-

1303
01:42:28,635 --> 01:42:30,480
Sorry my wife

1304
01:42:31,381 --> 01:42:33,480
The whole map was ruined

1305
01:42:34,388 --> 01:42:37,280
Lucky was not afraid to start filming

1306
01:42:38,615 --> 01:42:41,400
Lady Malice, you were in danger because of me

1307
01:42:42,001 --> 01:42:42,840
Purpose?

1308
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:45,069
My wife, Sapena

1309
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:52,240
Sapena wants Malice to go and the filming will be closed

1310
01:42:52,693 --> 01:42:54,600
Why not shut the video?

1311
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:59,023
What do I do with movies? I want Sapena to come back

1312
01:42:59,028 --> 01:43:02,000
Now Darwak gets jealous

1313
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,800
John Darwach's messenger, because the filming continues

1314
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,600
... if the video is shut down

1315
01:43:09,092 --> 01:43:11,070
Who else is the one to decide on the scene?

1316
01:43:11,070 --> 01:43:15,682
You go, we have a new author
His dad is writing

1317
01:43:15,682 --> 01:43:17,480
A true story

1318
01:43:18,936 --> 01:43:21,960
What does his dad write, who is he?

1319
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:27,160
No, no, my wife, I'm taking a fire from jealousy
I want to be more fun

1320
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:30,520
I want to accept all the conditions

1321
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:35,680
Promise that he never doubts me

1322
01:43:45,806 --> 01:43:49,640
Panning Singh, Dupe is playing with me

1323
01:43:51,437 --> 01:43:56,080
But he does not know that I'm the hero of this game

1324
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:01,080
Do you have a wife, do not you? Why are you telling me?

1325
01:44:04,931 --> 01:44:08,400
You have to express your passion

1326
01:44:09,392 --> 01:44:10,872
So I burn the dope out of jealousy

1327
01:44:13,168 --> 01:44:16,680
I want to make me jealous

1328
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:20,681
Goodbye, I'm going to make him afraid

1329
01:44:20,681 --> 01:44:23,160
You're coming along

1330
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:25,600
Daddy dan
the light-

1331
01:44:26,956 --> 01:44:29,560
The camera has to be here, it's a great scene

1332
01:44:36,292 --> 01:44:41,520
Pinky, I'll break this neck
This is my dear actor

1333
01:44:44,191 --> 01:44:48,280
Your sister's husband?
Saw Saw, no, no, I'm Pany-

1334
01:44:50,506 --> 01:44:52,705
The wife of her dignified wisdom

1335
01:44:54,775 --> 01:45:00,400
Hello. Today you are helping me with great gratitude

1336
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:05,041
My friend pani
I can do anything for you-

1337
01:45:05,650 --> 01:45:10,000
I swear to Goddess, I'm very angry now

1338
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:15,007
There's a lot of fire now
It has come

1339
01:45:15,032 --> 01:45:17,120
Lets start

1340
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,020
What are you doing, Go Onur!

1341
01:45:19,127 --> 01:45:26,072
Come on, Pany, talk with more emotions

1342
01:45:27,252 --> 01:45:28,252
Malika Mrs.

1343
01:45:28,991 --> 01:45:31,991
This blue squirrel looks very much for you

1344
01:45:33,749 --> 01:45:35,311
You are sorry

1345
01:45:35,311 --> 01:45:40,511
Today, you ... come on, sit next to me

1346
01:45:41,088 --> 01:45:43,551
Such situations are low

1347
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:46,231
Pani

1348
01:45:46,231 --> 01:45:49,831
Pani
Poniot is calling, sir, where do you go?

1349
01:45:49,831 --> 01:45:53,911
Pony Go Onur
Look here, there's something back-

1350
01:45:53,911 --> 01:45:55,111
look

1351
01:45:55,111 --> 01:45:57,991
Come closer

1352
01:45:57,991 --> 01:46:00,511
Come close

1353
01:46:00,511 --> 01:46:02,511
Do not touch your hand
what happened?-

1354
01:46:14,799 --> 01:46:19,351
Look at Pony, what is she going to eat with her eyes

1355
01:46:23,070 --> 01:46:24,711
what's up here?

1356
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:29,246
I do not know, I did not write it

1357
01:46:29,246 --> 01:46:31,206
I say so good

1358
01:46:32,916 --> 01:46:36,446
You can not trust anything in this world anymore

1359
01:46:36,446 --> 01:46:39,126
You see what it's like to do with your cheesecake

1360
01:46:39,126 --> 01:46:40,686
It's very obvious

1361
01:46:40,686 --> 01:46:45,138
... Now I do not dupe, I'll give her a lesson

1362
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:46,430
Sapena

1363
01:47:03,258 --> 01:47:06,406
Tride, help Mrs. Tride

1364
01:47:06,406 --> 01:47:08,766
Do not wait, go away

1365
01:47:10,088 --> 01:47:11,911
I do not need anyone's help

1366
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:25,742
What is this

1367
01:47:26,054 --> 01:47:29,006
Today my heart is shaky

1368
01:47:30,138 --> 01:47:35,006
How do you go where do you go? She is wounded, why are you?
Taken?

1369
01:47:35,006 --> 01:47:36,606
come here

1370
01:47:37,994 --> 01:47:41,006
Wissa here, I'm going to be working again

1371
01:47:41,006 --> 01:47:44,887
Today space is not suitable. Filming tomorrow

1372
01:47:44,887 --> 01:47:47,886
Space is not good! Filming tomorrow

1373
01:47:47,919 --> 01:47:51,863
Still, the movie does not come out to you, dialogue
You can not tell, you have the Punjabi dialect

1374
01:47:51,888 --> 01:47:57,406
You will work half an hour at 6 o'clock, tomorrow
Take pictures!

1375
01:47:57,406 --> 01:48:01,126
Let's understand it
Come on, actress, talk calmly with her -

1376
01:48:01,126 --> 01:48:05,065
I tell him you come in, calmly

1377
01:48:05,090 --> 01:48:10,047
What are you doing here? Because you're the producer
Come on, I can not keep my dialog

1378
01:48:10,047 --> 01:48:12,961
With a slip? Shut up

1379
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:14,886
Malika come here

1380
01:48:16,878 --> 01:48:23,486
This is a very interesting scene, here for your first time here
You want to tell how much you like it

1381
01:48:23,486 --> 01:48:25,926
OK?

1382
01:48:27,081 --> 01:48:28,081
sister

1383
01:48:28,657 --> 01:48:31,566
Excellent
Feel free to cry -

1384
01:48:36,152 --> 01:48:38,926

Vasya Sapena

1387
01:48:51,934 --> 01:48:59,286
If you go today, you will never know what your heart is doing

1388
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:06,166
When you've gone, you're waiting for each moment

1389
01:49:07,658 --> 01:49:12,166
Sounds like you think

1390
01:49:12,556 --> 01:49:15,766
The phone rings, I think your phone

1391
01:49:15,766 --> 01:49:19,406
Sometimes I feel you did not go

1392
01:49:19,406 --> 01:49:24,486
Right now your sister's voice came and you were on

1393
01:49:24,486 --> 01:49:29,606
Daddy chose your name correctly

1394
01:49:29,606 --> 01:49:34,246
Really you're like a dream

1395
01:49:34,246 --> 01:49:39,726
Everywhere you see, my world is stopped there

1396
01:49:39,726 --> 01:49:45,526
Every time I get you, I'm laughing at you

1397
01:49:46,485 --> 01:49:51,846
You say, without me I can live?

1398
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:57,886
Without you, Sapna I'm flawed

1399
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,526
Cut was great

1400
01:50:25,273 --> 01:50:26,273

1403
01:50:40,516 --> 01:50:44,125
Why did not you call I went to the airport for you

1404
01:50:44,125 --> 01:50:51,196
My daughter, who am I? Well, I remember tomorrow's anniversary of your marriage

1405
01:50:51,196 --> 01:50:53,830
So I came. Are you surprised?

1406
01:50:53,830 --> 01:51:03,436
Tomorrow is a great day. So I'm happy for you
I prayed for a ceremony

1407
01:51:04,287 --> 01:51:05,676
Where is your husband?

1408
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:09,476
The woman is dead

1409
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:14,956
Pony Singh, I got into trouble

1410
01:51:15,006 --> 01:51:19,276
Tomorrow, Baba Jun will be celebrating the anniversary of the wedding

1411
01:51:19,909 --> 01:51:21,276

01:51:28,655 --> 01:51:31,364
Okay, I'll tell her

1414
01:51:31,364 --> 01:51:34,716
Mr. Pany Singh, I am giving myself part

01:51:34,716 --> 01:51:37,316
Be sure to bring the dope

1416
01:51:39,042 --> 01:51:42,316
I do not want to know the problem of our relationship with us

1417
01:51:43,526 --> 01:51:45,788
Okay, come

1418
01:51:58,356 --> 01:51:59,612

Good luck to the kids, I promise you that
Remind me to be together

1422
01:52:18,501 --> 01:52:22,916
The foundation of the marriage is based on trust

1423
01:52:22,916 --> 01:52:25,556
Never question the trust of each other

1424
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:35,093
Trust in the failure to bring it back

02:04:22,177 --> 02:04:25,544
Dear Mishra, you are the name
Both went to the wind

1457
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,071
At least a good spit

1458
02:04:28,686 --> 02:04:31,745
I'm very sad
I want to do it from you

1459
02:04:32,421 --> 02:04:36,773
I want to make my biography
People should be aware of what the danger was

1460
02:04:37,494 --> 02:04:39,136
Say my soul

1461
02:04:41,169 --> 02:04:43,169
Money, what's your budget?

1462
02:04:43,375 --> 02:04:44,248
One hundred crore

1463
02:04:45,008 --> 02:04:47,106
You say yes
Now let's face it

1464
02:04:47,982 --> 02:04:49,924
What's the name of the movie?

1465
02:04:52,531 --> 02:04:54,331
Let's take a biography of Mr. Mischa

1466
02:04:58,024 --> 02:05:00,024
This song was translated at the beginning of the film

1467
02:05:00,503 --> 02:05:06,436
