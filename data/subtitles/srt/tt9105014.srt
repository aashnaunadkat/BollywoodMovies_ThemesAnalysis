2
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,140
Stop the game.

3
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,510
This is our pitch.

4
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,260
Hey!

5
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,430
Stop!

6
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,760
- Hello?
- Kabir?

7
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,600
Yes? My little boy
doesn't recognize my voice?

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Uncle Hameed?

9
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,200
As-salaam-alaykum.

10
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,850
Wa-alaykum as-salam.

11
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,600
It's been ages since
I have heard you.

12
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,550
Son, I would like
you to come to Srinagar.

13
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,600
Is everything alright?

14
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,490
I've something important to discuss.

15
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,160
It would be nice if you
could come and meet me.

16
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,070
Of course.

17
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,450
Khuda hafiz.

18
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,780
Khuda hafiz.

19
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,360
What are you in search of, my friend?

20
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:01,530
You were meant to wander.

21
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,200
Continue with your journey.

22
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:17,160
Till you reach your destination.

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,700
Strive on ahead.

24
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,660
Everybody is with you.

25
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,610
You just need to see it.

26
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,610
Live life to the fullest.

27
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,450
I am as determined as the wind.

28
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,410
The birds have taught me how to fly

29
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:49,450
I travel through these unknown roads.

30
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:57,490
My journey continues... I am not lost.

31
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:04,820
My journey continues... I am not lost.

32
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,160
In my journey.

33
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,240
I have learnt the truth.

34
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,780
About these questions.

35
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,780
What is the meaning of life?

36
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,660
Who am I? I know now.

37
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,490
I have found the answers.

38
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:53,490
Listen to the whispers of the wind.

39
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,200
Dust to dust.

40
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,820
Will return one day.

41
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,740
Enjoy your life in this world.

42
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,490
No one knows the future.

43
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,490
I am as determined as the wind.

44
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,490
The birds have taught me how to fly

45
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,910
I travel through these unknown roads.

46
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,530
My journey continues... I am not lost.

47
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,660
My journey continues... I am not lost.

48
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,530
My journey continues... I am not lost.

49
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,820
I am not lost.

50
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,490
I am not lost.

51
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,490
Lost.

52
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,030
Lost.

53
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,860
I am not lost.

54
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:17,550
My journey continues... I am not lost.

55
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,610
- We want...
- Freedom!

56
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,940
- We want...
- Freedom!

57
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,300
- God grant us...
- Freedom!

58
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,730
- Our beloved...
- Freedom!

59
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,090
- In the name of Shahdad...
- Freedom!

60
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,350
- In the name of Farhaan...
- Freedom!

61
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,510
- We will get...
- Freedom!

62
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,160
- From India, we'll get...
- Freedom!

63
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,320
Stop the game.

64
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,230
This is our pitch.

65
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,910
Now we'll play here!

66
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,030
Get out! Go away!

67
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,620
Do I need to repeat myself?

68
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,080
This is our pitch as well.
We are also playing here.

69
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,790
- What did you say?
- This pitch...

70
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,820
What are you looking at?
Will you hit me?

71
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,530
But I won't leave either!

72
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
Really?

73
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,030
Okay, then let's play.

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,160
Kabir!

75
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,490
Uncle Hameed.

76
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,410
My child...

77
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,320
how are you?

78
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,490
Good.

79
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,490
What were you looking at?

80
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,580
My childhood treasure.

81
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,530
Do you remember this?

82
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,910
Your father used to
be so upset with your marks.

83
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,110
This couldn't be the grades of
a teacher's son he was bound to be upset.

84
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,950
He'd be upset because
he knew you could do better.

85
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,950
Uncle Hameed,
what about father's school?

86
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,200
It has been taken
over by the government.

87
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,320
It's in a sorry state.

88
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,530
Why?

89
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
It's difficult to find teachers.

90
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,950
There was one lady teacher last year...

91
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,280
She has left as well.

92
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,290
If this continues,
the government might shut it down.

93
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,860
How can they shut it down?

94
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,410
What about the children then?
Exactly.

95
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,780
Pandit ji started this school because he believed
that if the children can't reach school...

96
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,490
The school should reach
out to the children.

97
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,070
If only someone like
you could teach there...

98
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,410
Is that why you called me here?

99
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,360
How can I teach?

100
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,490
Fine then... the poor children
will have to give up studies.

101
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,780
Uncle Hameed!

102
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,280
You were in the army?

103
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,530
Yes, sir.

104
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,820
Why did you leave?

105
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,780
And now you want to teach?

106
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,210
Yes.

107
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,610
Why Wular School?

108
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,156
I heard the school
doesn't have a teacher.

109
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,290
And I can teach the younger children.

110
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,610
Hmm...

111
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,030
Can you cook?

112
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,950
What?

113
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,450
Do you know how to mop?

114
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,410
Excuse me?

115
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,110
Can you swim?

116
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,490
Sir, isn't Firdaus teacher coming?

117
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,360
Who's Firdaus?

118
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,610
She's the one who taught last year.

119
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,360
Is it?

120
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Yes.

121
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,240
Isn't there any network?

122
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,820
There is,
when good weather and peace prevails.

123
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,490
But good weather and peace is a rarity.

124
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,490
Open your notebooks
and write today's date.

125
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,160
Let me know when you're done talking.

126
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,160
What's so funny?

127
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,910
Do I look like a joker?

128
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,240
Forgot your book?

129
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,160
Do you forget to eat?

130
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,530
You know what,
we'll have a surprise test today.

131
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,280
You, stand up.

132
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,506
Kneel down. Catch your ears.

133
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,910
Hands straight up. Hey!

134
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,240
16th March, 2007.

135
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,030
When I was a little girl,

136
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,860
Dad often took me for
star gazing on the terrace.

137
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,570
The Pole Star was my favorite.

138
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,200
After I lost my parents,
I got the Stars tattooed on my hand.

139
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,910
These stars guided
me whenever I was lost.

140
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,660
But I had no clue that
it would bring me here.

141
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
Ms. Firdaus, we're teachers.

142
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,280
We need to set an
example for the children.

143
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,700
As a principal, aren't you
giving this too much importance, sir?

144
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,546
I'm sure there are other important
matters that need your attention.

145
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,450
Apart from how I dress, my tattoo...

146
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,910
You have to get the tattoo removed.

147
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,030
Sorry sir, I won't.

148
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,110
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

149
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,200
Okay.

150
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,280
If you don't,
I'll be forced to transfer you to Wular.

151
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,910
Alright.

152
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,570
Can I get a couple
of days to pack my things?

153
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,910
On getting here I realised why

154
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,280
the principal threatened
to transfer teachers here.

155
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,070
There's no one for miles around.

156
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,200
It's like being exiled.

157
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,490
But there's always a
response to your hi-hello...

158
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,100
Hello...

159
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,950
In form of your echo.

160
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,860
Now try delivering a
Pizza here in 30 minutes!!!

161
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,360
This place is so far away...

162
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,360
that one can only
wait for Hope to reach.

163
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,290
Hello!

164
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,540
Remember Jaya Bachchan
in the film "Sholay"?

165
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,410
It feels the same.

166
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,860
Just that I don't have
"Jai" and "Veeru" for company.

167
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,490
All I have is...

168
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,530
"Gabbar".

169
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,810
It was my decision to come here.

170
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,450
Sometimes our decisions backfire...

171
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,320
and our hopes crumble.

172
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,580
I didn't know that there would
be no water, power or gas here.

173
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,490
I wish you were here with me, Junaid.

174
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,110
I miss you.

175
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,110
Brother! Brother!!

176
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,240
Hello..Brother!

177
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,710
Brother!

178
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,190
Hello! Brother... Hello...

179
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,530
As-salaamu-alaykum, I'm the new teacher.

180
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,110
I've been here for two days.

181
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,410
It's terrible.

182
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,490
There's no water,
power, gas or network here.

183
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,200
There's no one to talk to either.

184
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,930
I've hurt my hand.

185
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,270
Everything's a mess, I tell you.

186
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,880
I've come to teach but
none of the children have come.

187
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,226
It's been two days,
not even one child has showed up.

188
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,530
None of the children have come..

189
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,530
Do they even know there's
a new teacher here?

190
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,010
Two ones are two.

191
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,160
Two twos are four.

192
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,320
Your new teacher is here.

193
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,410
Show up at the door.

194
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,870
Why are you saying it like this?

195
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,820
Be it vegetables or a teacher,
this is how we need to sell...

196
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,950
Two ones are two.

197
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,070
Two twos are four.

198
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,030
Your new teacher is here.

199
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,910
Show up at the door.

200
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,610
I have fresh green vegetables...

201
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,660
and a school teacher too.

202
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,100
Madam, do you have children?

203
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,490
- Yes.
- Call them.

204
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,070
Son! Son!

205
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,890
Do you go to Wular School?

206
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,030
Yes.

207
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,110
Teacher... your school begins.

208
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,060
Good morning.

209
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,150
Good morning, teacher.

210
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,680
Do you know my name?

211
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,870
No, teacher.

212
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,850
I will act it out and you have to guess.

213
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,170
Okay, teacher.

214
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,060
Quickly!

215
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Circle!

216
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,600
Again!

217
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
Round!

218
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
[HINDI FOR AGAIN]... Fir?

219
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,600
Fir-bus?

220
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,930
Fir-dus?

221
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Firdaus.

222
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,440
Correct.

223
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,430
My name is Firdaus.

224
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,140
Unlike words, we don't forget actions.

225
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,350
I want you to act out your names.

226
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,960
Ready?

227
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,390
Who will go first?

228
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,720
What are you doing? This is how
we introduce ourselves in class.

229
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,600
Firdaus teacher taught us,
we don't forget actions.

230
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,730
Really?

231
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,730
Okay, tell me.

232
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,810
Jeep?

233
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,430
Car?

234
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,520
My name is... Wow! Car!

235
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,770
My name is Waqar and I study in Grade 2.

236
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,220
One finger?

237
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,890
Three fingers?

238
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,180
(HINDI FOR DATE)... Tariq.
Tariq.

239
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,140
I get it.

240
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,390
Grade 4.

241
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,600
One river?

242
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,850
My name is Iqrah. Grade 2.

243
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,120
I am Shama, this is Dingu.

244
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,060
We're in grade 3.

245
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,470
And you are?

246
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,890
(HINDI FOR PRAYER)... Dua!

247
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,810
I study in grade 1.

248
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,770
Are you all in different grades?

249
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,890
Sir, what's your name?

250
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,430
I am Kabir.

251
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,030
Let's start.

252
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,570
Sir, won't Firdaus teacher come?

253
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
No.

254
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,570
Dua, start with the alphabets.

255
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,320
A for apple, B for baby, C for cat...

256
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,400
Waqar, what is 27 plus 13?

257
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

258
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,220
- Do you know your tables?
- Yes.

259
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,840
- Say them.
- Which one?

260
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,700
The two times table.

261
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,610
Two ones are two.
Two twos are four...

262
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Iqrah...

263
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,570
Hello, Dolly?

264
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
Where are you?

265
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,780
You haven't paid my phone bill!

266
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,680
Right, Dolly...

267
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,380
Hello, I can't hear...

268
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
The network... Dolly?

269
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,280
Hello..I can't hear you Dolly..

270
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,400
Dolly this place has network issues

271
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,330
Dolly your voice is not clear.

272
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,990
Silence!

273
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,600
Sir, 40.

274
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,320
Shut up!

275
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,490
Stay here!

276
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,886
I'll make a call and be back.

277
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,910
Tariq, come.

278
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,700
Why is there no signal?

279
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,450
Sir, should we go back?

280
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,950
Wait a minute.

281
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,070
Sir, let's go.

282
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,570
Two minutes.

283
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,990
- What happened?
- Diesel.

284
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,320
Has it run out?
Not yet, but will soon.

285
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,450
Tariq, there's no one here.

286
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Where are they?

287
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,950
Hey, what are you doing there?

288
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,030
Fishing, sir!

289
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,490
Come here, right now!

290
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,360
Waqar, Shama, Dua, Iqrah...
I'm also coming!

291
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,490
Quiet!

292
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,610
Just come here right now!

293
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,280
Why did you go in the
water without my permission?

294
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
I can't monitor you all the time.

295
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,610
We wanted to catch fish.

296
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,490
We're very hungry.

297
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,070
What if something had happened?

298
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,240
You could have drowned!

299
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,780
We know how to swim.

300
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,500
Okay, but what if something went wrong?

301
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,490
We've been swimming here forever,
nothing has happened.

302
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,950
What could've gone wrong?

303
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,490
Don't argue with me.

304
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,870
Come on, crouch like a chicken.

305
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,650
Chicken? We don't know how.

306
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,330
You don't how to crouch like a chicken?

307
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,990
What do you guys know then?

308
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,660
See, spread your legs,

309
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,740
crouch, bend your hands
like this and hold your ears.

310
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,530
Now, that's a good-looking chicken!

311
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,490
Does he doodle?

312
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,030
Let's eat him... I'm so hungry.

313
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Hold out your hands!

314
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,490
I said, hold out your hands!

315
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,070
Can't you hear me?

316
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,740
Sir, why did you hit me? I was with you.

317
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,320
No, you're with them.

318
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,520
All of you are a team.

319
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,740
Firdaus teacher never hit us.

320
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,610
Enough about your Firdaus teacher.

321
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,700
Tell me if you don't want me here,
I'll leave.

322
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,500
Then leave.

323
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,780
Tomorrow being a weekend,
it's a holiday.

324
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,700
I hope he doesn't return on Monday.

325
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,450
Are you a lefty or a righty?

326
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,150
Lefty.

327
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,610
Start doing everything
with your right hand.

328
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,320
We'll have to amputate this hand.

329
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,950
What?

330
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,810
Just kidding.

331
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Nurse?

332
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,410
Doctor, please take a look,
I hope it's nothing serious.

333
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,160
- I'm very concerned.
- Show me.

334
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,450
I had told her, if she went there...
Junaid, relax.

335
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,740
It's an allergic reaction
to something in the water.

336
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,030
I'll prescribe some
medicines and an ointment.

337
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,410
Apply that.

338
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,490
It'll fine soon.

339
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,070
Yes, it will be fine,
but then she will return to that school.

340
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,030
She can't even swim properly
but will still jump in the water

341
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,990
and get the rash back.

342
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,660
I'll send the medicines.

343
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,360
Come on Firdaus,
despite me not approving of it,

344
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,450
why do you have to
return to that school?

345
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,320
What if I want to meet you?

346
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,190
We can only meet on weekends.

347
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
That too, after traveling for 6 hours.

348
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,591
Tell me... God forbid...
what if something happens to you?

349
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,450
What'll we do, wait for the weekend?

350
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,240
Junaid what do you want?

351
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,020
I want you to take a transfer back.

352
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,990
You know that's not possible.

353
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,530
Why not?

354
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,530
Oh, because of this tattoo?

355
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
I'd not approved this too.

356
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,320
But you never listen to me.

357
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,320
You just want to prove
that principal wrong.

358
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,280
Why are you doing this?

359
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,280
For those 4-5 children You've left everything
and gone to that godforsaken place.

360
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,320
What will you gain from all this?

361
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,450
What will I gain?

362
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,920
There are seven children there, Junaid.

363
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,490
And stop telling me,
that you don't approve.

364
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,360
I'm tired of hearing that.
So am I.

365
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,780
I can't do this anymore.

366
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Then let's break up.

367
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
Break up?

368
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,030
It's very simple for you, right?

369
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,200
How do you manage to
find excuses to break up?

370
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,280
I've a feeling, you took this
transfer just to get away from me.

371
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,750
Really?

372
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,240
Is that how you feel?

373
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,200
Then I think you should leave.

374
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,200
I probably should.

375
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Stop right here.

376
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Okay.

377
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,410
- How much?
- Rs. 35.

378
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,630
Here.

379
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,740
Don't you have change?

380
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Please hurry up.
I am doing it bro..

381
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,320
Your girl?

382
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Please hurry.

383
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,300
Fine, 4, 5...

384
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Here.

385
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Should I follow them?

386
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:35,290
Love is delusion, don't fall for it...

387
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:45,500
Love is delusion, don't fall for it...

388
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,080
Love is delusion, don't fall for it...

389
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,700
A delusion.

390
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,560
A delusion.

391
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,650
A delusion.

392
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,330
A delusion.

393
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,770
A delusion.

394
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,430
A delusion.

395
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,350
A delusion.

396
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,530
It happened to me as well.

397
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,650
All girls are the same.

398
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,460
A delusion.

399
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,460
Since the time I have seen you, my love.

400
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,070
Something that shouldn't
happen is happening, my love.

401
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,930
A delusion.

402
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,720
A delusion.

403
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,660
Since the time I have seen you, my love.

404
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,160
Something that shouldn't
happen is happening, my love

405
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,160
Mark my words - he'll go
to her room through the window.

406
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,360
A delusion.

407
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,060
A delusion.

408
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,170
And then... lights out!

409
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,510
A delusion.

410
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,040
Love is delusion, don't fall for it...

411
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,090
Love is delusion, don't fall for it...

412
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,700
Do you have a light?

413
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,700
There's one in the bike's toolbox.

414
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,360
How did you know?

415
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,000
Because it's my matchbox, my bike...

416
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,030
And my girlfriend.

417
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Thank you, my friend.

418
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,660
Okay.

419
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,030
He's right here.

420
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,320
I'll call you back.

421
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,990
Are you a kid?

422
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,070
Why don't you grow up?

423
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,740
Show some maturity.

424
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,876
Now you'll ask me,
'how long has this been going on?'

425
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,280
'I had just left.'

426
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,320
It's not about that.

427
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,610
The word is 'security'

428
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,730
Have you ever thought about our future?

429
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,700
You had a good job in the army,
but you left it.

430
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
And now you're teaching
in some godforsaken school.

431
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,320
What if you don't have a job next year?

432
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,200
One of us has to be mature.

433
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,160
My bike...

434
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,320
What?

435
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,240
How could you give my bike to him?

436
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Bike?

437
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,610
You're about to lose your girl
and you're worried about the bike?

438
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,570
Since childhood Junaid
loved flying kites.

439
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,780
And I always held the reel for him.

440
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,530
He'd be very happy
when the kite soared high.

441
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,740
Though I felt that the
kite wanted to soar higher.

442
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,410
But Junaid was holding it back.

443
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,030
The time kite thread
broke it made me very happy.

444
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:26,320
I felt... though it was short lived

445
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,610
it was the kite's flight of freedom.

446
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,500
How strange-A childhood
friendship ends in a matter of days!

447
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,240
Why are relationships so fragile?

448
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,000
Why do we need a relationship
to feel complete?

449
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:55,940
I've been a daughter to my father, a girlfriend
to my boyfriend, a friend to a friend...

450
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,320
But, what am I to myself?

451
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,110
For myself.

452
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,360
I'm whole by myself.

453
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
I am enough.

454
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,110
And I want to thank the
universe for making me enough.

455
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,240
STATUTORY WARNING:

456
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,070
You must try this,
at least once in your life.

457
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,330
Thank you!

458
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,200
Thank you.

459
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,070
Thank you!

460
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,240
Thank you!

461
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,160
Thank you!

462
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
Thank you!

463
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,590
Thank you!

464
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,530
Time and apologies are free...

465
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,780
Give them when they are due.

466
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,360
Please pick me up at 4 o'clock.

467
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,200
Firdaus, I'm sorry for that day.

468
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,240
It's okay.

469
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,700
You know that I worry about you.

470
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,700
I tend to say things that
I don't mean when I'm angry.

471
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,320
It's because of my love for you.

472
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,740
I know, Junaid.

473
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,320
I am fine here.

474
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,950
In fact, I like it here.

475
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,590
But I don't...

476
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,990
like to see you here, all alone.

477
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,830
I'm not alone,
the children are here with me.

478
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,030
What's wrong?

479
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,030
Go.

480
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,740
You too?

481
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Go.

482
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,700
These children will never let you leave.

483
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,110
So you stay here on weekdays,
with the children.

484
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,450
And spend the weekends with me.

485
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,700
And I mean, only with me.

486
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,320
Why're you being so sweet?

487
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,800
Because you may break
up with me again...

488
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,850
Firdaus teacher!

489
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,030
What happened, Tariq!

490
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,310
What's wrong? Why'd you shout?

491
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Tell me. Tell me, what happened.

492
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,910
Over there.

493
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,670
Thank you for informing us.

494
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,440
There was firing in the mountains,
a few days ago.

495
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,840
The body must have floated here.

496
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,880
Everything is under control now.

497
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,550
There's nothing to worry about.

498
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,750
Let us know if you need anything.

499
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,340
Definitely, officer.
Thank you very much.

500
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Goodbye.

501
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,970
Boys, is lunch ready?

502
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,550
We're very hungry, isn't it?

503
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,880
Imran, be careful.

504
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,670
Tariq is the masala ready?

505
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,330
Tariq...

506
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,460
Nothing will happen.

507
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,050
Nothing will happen.

508
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,520
Firdaus, I've packed your bag, let's go.

509
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,590
Where?

510
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,460
Back home.

511
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,590
Come on, hurry up.

512
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,630
Junaid, I understand your concern.
Good, then let's go.

513
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,120
Please listen.
There's nothing more to discuss.

514
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,226
Junaid, if I leave,
the principal will shut the school.

515
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,460
Be it...

516
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,040
Junaid, I can't leave the school.

517
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,420
School?

518
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,286
You call this a school, Firdaus?
There's no water, power or network here.

519
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,320
And now the dead body!

520
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,550
I can't leave you alone.
It's not safe here.

521
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,340
- But it's not that I...
- Please, Firdaus.

522
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,670
Give me one reason to stay.

523
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,380
Not one... I have seven reasons.

524
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,670
Maybe, I came here because
I wanted to prove myself right.

525
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,750
But now these children need me.

526
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,000
I will not leave them alone.

527
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,170
I don't believe that
I chose to stay back.

528
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,550
Today I understand, during difficult times,
where my parents got their strength from.

529
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,750
Because they knew I was watching them.

530
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,750
The way these children
are watching me today.

531
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:21,920
I could have not set an
example of not facing the problem.

532
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,500
By quitting.

533
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,130
Now I know why parents
are called the first teachers.

534
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,380
And that's why a teacher
needs to become a parent.

535
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,470
Tomorrow will be a new day,
a new chapter

536
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,800
with a stronger me and a better me.

537
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,350
Good morning!

538
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,910
That teacher hit him, very hard... my little
fish is not feeling well... has headache...

539
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,330
Good morning, Waqar!

540
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,170
Good morning.

541
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,300
Loser!

542
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,380
You know what, we don't need this.

543
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,550
No cane, no pain.

544
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,936
We will solve a new problem today.

545
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,250
Whoever solves these
first will get a star.

546
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,710
Wait...

547
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
Ready?

548
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,550
1, 2, 3, go!

549
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,210
Come on.

550
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,710
Dua, let's read the alphabets.

551
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,420
Teacher, I'm done.

552
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,880
Very good, Imran.

553
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Give me your hand.

554
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,470
Well done.

555
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,670
Tell me, A for?

556
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,550
Apple.

557
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,440
B for?

558
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,380
Ball.

559
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,590
C for?

560
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,420
Snake.

561
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,000
No my child, it's C for cat.

562
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,330
Snake!

563
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,470
Cat!

564
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,840
Snake!

565
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,920
Snake!

566
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:38,710
Snake!

567
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,680
Snake!

568
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,350
I won't spare it...

569
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:52,730
Tariq don't.. What are you doing? Stop!

570
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,500
All snakes don't bite.

571
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,320
Even if it does,
all snakes are not poisonous.

572
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,550
Sir, the snake?

573
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,800
Wait, I'll do something.

574
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,000
Sir... careful, it may bite.

575
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
Okay.

576
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,920
See, no damage done!

577
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,320
I told you, all snakes don't bite.

578
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,840
It bit me!

579
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,330
The snake bit me!
Sir got bitten by a snake!

580
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,390
I got bitten.
Sir got bitten by a snake!

581
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,390
Quickly tie the hand.

582
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,200
Not yours,
tie my hand with a piece of cloth.

583
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,880
Don't worry sir, I'm here.

584
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,550
Hurry up, I'm blacking out.

585
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,710
You will be fine, sir.
Don't let me sleep.

586
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:57,880
Slap me!

587
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,110
I'm dying! I'm dying!

588
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,190
Take me to the hospital...
take me to the hospital.

589
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,340
Let's go, hurry up.

590
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,470
I'm turning blue.

591
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,630
It's not a snake bite... it's a
nail bite... These nails have hurt you.

592
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:29,640
'I told you, all snakes don't bite.'
I'm going to die.

593
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,470
'Take me to the hospital!'

594
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,250
'I'm blacking out.'

595
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,730
'I'm turning blue.'

596
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:39,870
It's not snake bite... it's a
nail bite.."These nails have hurt you.'

597
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,170
What happened?

598
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,340
I don't have time for all this!

599
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,140
But, I have all the time
in the world for you guys.

600
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,000
You speak Kashmiri?

601
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,210
Bye, Kabir sir!
Bye, khuda hafiz!

602
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:44,880
Bye!

603
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,250
'I got bitten by a snake!'

604
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,130
Hey!

605
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,140
'I got bitten by a snake!'

606
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,960
'I got bitten by a snake!'

607
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,460
Sir... what's up?

608
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,120
Nothing.

609
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,470
Coochie coo, coochie coo!

610
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,550
Hey!

611
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,400
I can't get the stars for you.

612
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,970
They're out of my reach.

613
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,950
I'm just another guy.

614
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:49,330
There's nothing special about me.

615
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:55,920
There's nothing special about me.

616
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,850
Nevertheless, my heart.

617
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,680
Asks you...

618
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,470
Will you fall in love with me?

619
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,270
Nevertheless, my heart.

620
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,150
Asks you...

621
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:19,420
Will you fall in love with me?

622
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,260
Children,
we'll have a memory test today.

623
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,170
I want you to draw somebody's
picture from memory.

624
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,020
Okay?

625
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,710
Whose picture do we draw?

626
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,920
Firdaus teacher, who else?

627
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:49,130
Why don't you visit me.

628
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:54,000
In my dreams...

629
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:59,420
Your story is known far and wide.

630
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,710
The trees...

631
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:11,240
And the mountains.

632
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,550
Echo your name.

633
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,960
To make this dream come true.

634
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,330
I will not be able.

635
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,340
I'm just another guy.

636
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,970
There's nothing special about me.

637
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:46,500
There's nothing special about me.

638
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,250
Nevertheless, my heart.

639
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,140
Asks you...

640
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:58,590
Will you fall in love with me?

641
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,680
I've found a photograph
of Firdaus teacher!

642
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,240
Asks you...

643
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:10,210
Will you fall in love with me?

644
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:13,380
Nevertheless, my heart.

645
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,990
Asks you...

646
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:21,750
Will you fall in love with me?

647
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,370
Tariq, shut the windows.

648
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,610
My Dingu...

649
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,920
Kabir sir.. Shama...

650
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,700
My Dingu!

651
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,550
Shama!

652
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,960
Kabir sir, my Dingu!

653
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,420
Kabir sir!

654
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,510
I can't take this off.

655
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,960
Dingu!

656
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,600
Why're you so sad?

657
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,520
Our school is destroyed.
What'll we do now?

658
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,150
We'll build it again.

659
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,740
Friends, come down.

660
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,320
We will go to see Dal.

661
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,700
Friends, come down.

662
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,780
Friends, come down.

663
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,620
We will go to see Dal.

664
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,660
Friends, come down...

665
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,910
We will sing songs of fun.

666
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,280
And be happy.

667
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,280
And create a melody.

668
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:52,990
Shaped with our broken dreams.

669
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,370
Come... let us dance.

670
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:59,030
Bumbro(BUMBLEBEE)...Bumbro.

671
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,620
O dark-hued Bumbro.

672
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:07,200
O dark-hued Bumbro.

673
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:10,740
Why are you making such a din?

674
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,910
O dark-hued Bumbro.

675
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,320
O dark-hued Bumbro.

676
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:25,740
Why are you making such a din?

677
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,570
Spread colour everywhere...

678
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,570
Like the butterflies do.

679
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,300
Spread the fragrance of flowers.

680
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,740
Far and wide.

681
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,540
Spread colour everywhere...

682
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,330
Like the butterflies do.

683
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,080
Spread the fragrance of flowers.

684
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,950
Far and wide.

685
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,410
You dance and spread
happiness everywhere.

686
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:10,490
You can change the world.

687
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,160
Let the sparkle in your eyes.

688
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,830
Light up the world.

689
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,120
Come on... let us dance.

690
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,370
Bumbro... Bumbro.

691
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:28,490
O dark-hued Bumbro.

692
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,080
O dark-hued Bumbro.

693
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:35,700
Why are you making such a din?

694
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,000
Friends, come down.

695
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,950
We will go to see Dal.

696
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,700
Friends, come down.

697
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,620
We will go to see Dal.

698
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:50,040
Bumbro... Bumbro...

699
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,950
Friends, come down.

700
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,580
We will go to see Dal.

701
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:57,080
Bumbro... Bumbro...

702
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,960
O dark-hued Bumbro.

703
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,580
O dark-hued Bumbro.

704
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,120
Bumbro.

705
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,790
Bye!

706
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,700
Khuda hafiz, Kabir sir!
Bye, Dua!

707
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,500
- Bye...
- Khuda hafiz!

708
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:10,580
Khuda hafiz!

709
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,620
Bye, bye.

710
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,660
Khuda hafiz!

711
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,910
Shama, why don't you
stay back with me today?

712
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,370
I can't, my mother's waiting for me.

713
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:30,040
Dingu's mother must
be waiting for him too.

714
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,160
The father is 20 years
older than his son.

715
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,920
And the father's age
is 3 times the age of the son.

716
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,070
So, how old is the father?

717
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,620
Imran?

718
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,670
Teacher, the father's age is 30.

719
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,290
Very good, Imran.

720
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:41,160
Well done, Imran.

721
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,240
Imran, you're a good student.

722
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:52,290
If you continue like this, you'll
do very well in your semester exams.

723
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,870
Only if father allows
me to appear for the exams.

724
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,090
What do you mean?

725
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,040
Nothing.

726
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:39,620
Imran, why didn't
you come to school today?

727
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,120
You knew there'd be an exam today.

728
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,790
Don't you know how
important these exams are?

729
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,910
You think these exams
won't make a difference?

730
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,040
You'll fail, Imran.

731
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,410
Do you understand what I'm saying?

732
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,170
Why didn't you come to school?

733
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:58,660
I told him not to.

734
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,580
As-salaam-alaykum.

735
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,790
Wa-alaykum as-salam.

736
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,910
Imran had his first exam today.

737
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,660
If he misses these exams,
he'll lose a year.

738
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,040
He has a very promising future.

739
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:16,620
He's capable of topping
these exams in the state.

740
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,080
The lives of Kashmiri
children are bound by...

741
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,740
their debt and their duty.

742
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:26,620
He will fulfill his duties...
he doesn't need your school.

743
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,870
We have our ways of teaching him.

744
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:31,830
How can we decide his fate?

745
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:34,990
He'll decide for himself.

746
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,740
Imran, do you want to go to school?

747
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:43,040
Do you want to go to school?

748
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:45,950
Do you want to go to school?

749
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,740
No.

750
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,830
I've seen many boys like
Imran walk down the wrong path...

751
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,700
never to return.

752
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:14,580
Darkness can't be driven by darkness
It can only be conquered by light.

753
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:20,080
I'm familiar with the
darkness that surrounds Imran.

754
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:24,450
Education was the light
that helped me conquer darkness.

755
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:32,830
I hope the light that I was unable to provide
to Imran finds a way to reach him...

756
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,140
Excuse me?

757
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:23,790
As-salaam-alaykum.

758
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,160
Wa-alaykum as-salam.

759
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,080
I am Kabir,
I'm the new teacher at Wular School.

760
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,040
I wanted to talk to you.

761
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:31,790
Yes?

762
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,120
I wanted Imran to rejoin the school.

763
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:35,990
Oh...

764
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,490
His father won't agree to it.

765
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,120
Please call him, I'll talk to him.

766
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,580
He's not at home.

767
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,910
No problem, I'll wait here.

768
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,600
No, what I mean to say is he'll
be back only after a few months.

769
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,040
Why don't you send
Imran to school till then?

770
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,050
I'll speak to his father when he returns.
I know he won't agree.

771
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:52,040
You don't understand...

772
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,910
No, you don't understand,
I can't go against my husband.

773
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,660
Look, I...

774
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,040
He's the new school teacher.

775
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:04,700
As-salaam-alaykum.

776
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,620
Wa-alaykum as-salam.

777
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,370
Children wait to be
rewarded with this star.

778
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,120
Ever since you've left,
this star has been lonely.

779
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:45,040
I've heard, darkness can't be driven by
darkness It can only be conquered by light.

780
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:48,620
Please reconsider.

781
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,620
I'll leave now.

782
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,660
Khuda hafiz.

783
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,740
So, the father's age
is 3 times the age of the son.

784
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,160
Son's age is equal to X.

785
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:15,040
Father's age is equal to 3X.

786
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:22,120
So, 3X=20+X.

787
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,960
Make this a fraction.

788
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,490
Switch the variables.

789
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:29,700
3=20+X upon X.

790
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,910
Cancel the two Xs.

791
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,830
So, 3 = 20.

792
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,120
Simple.

793
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,830
- Understand?
- Sir,

794
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,160
X = 10 and 3X = 30.

795
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:42,950
So, father's age is 30.

796
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,990
Sir, can she get admission too?

797
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,040
What is this, Kabir?

798
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,870
I'm trying my best, sir.

799
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:26,040
If the marks don't improve
in the second semester,

800
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,620
then I'm sorry,
we can't continue with you.

801
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,490
Sir?

802
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,160
The teacher who taught last year...

803
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,740
Do you know where she is?

804
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,570
Why?

805
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:51,290
I wanted to discuss few
issues about the children.

806
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,370
She's been around teaching
at DPS along with her fiancé.

807
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,410
She's getting married,
that's why you were hired.

808
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:02,990
Rohan!

809
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,830
Deepak!

810
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,370
Raahil, you have to
lift your friend Sameer.

811
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,040
What did you see?

812
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,830
Raahil could not lift Sameer.

813
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,660
Because Sameer is heavier than Raahil.

814
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:37,370
Okay.

815
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,040
Raahil and Sameer, get into the water.

816
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,620
Come on, hurry up.

817
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,580
Try and lift him now.

818
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,160
Did you see that?

819
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,200
When we put something in water,

820
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,450
the force of the water pushes it up.

821
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,410
This is known as buoyancy, okay?

822
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:02,790
Ms. Firdaus?

823
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
We need to talk.

824
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:06,240
Yes, sir?

825
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,776
Why do children need to come
to the pool for a science class?

826
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,870
Who will be responsible
if someone drowns?

827
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,040
Junaid, this is not the first time!

828
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:16,240
I've repeatedly told her,
but she refuses to listen.

829
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:19,490
Sir, the students need
practical experience too.

830
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,040
I've also taught science,
that too inside a classroom.

831
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,100
And the children still understand.

832
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,460
Sir, mugging up is not
the same as understanding.

833
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:30,820
Ms. Firdaus, every teacher
has their own way to teach.

834
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,450
Exactly, and this is my way.

835
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,740
And if the children can understand..
Where's the problem?

836
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,660
Junaid, please explain to her.

837
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,450
What's there to explain? Enough.

838
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,240
But Junaid, if I...
I said enough, Ms. Firdaus.

839
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,620
You will not get the
children to the pool again.

840
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:51,780
Stop Firdaus.

841
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,990
Firdaus, listen to me.

842
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,570
Firdaus, work is work,
don't mix it with personal matters.

843
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,400
I'm not mixing anything Junaid.

844
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:02,070
You got promoted at the right time.

845
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,120
You know exactly how
much the principal likes me!

846
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,280
Firdaus, you need to learn to adjust.

847
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,490
Don't you think I'm trying?

848
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,336
I even got rid of my
tattoo because you insisted.

849
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,426
How much more should I change?

850
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:14,070
It's not about changing!

851
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,206
This isn't like your remote
school with 4-5 children.

852
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,150
This school follows strict
rules and regulations.

853
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,320
Junaid, I know how difficult
it was for you to get me a job here.

854
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,110
Honestly, I was happier in
that school with 4-5 children...

855
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,030
I wish I could go back there.

856
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,070
Well then,
you should do what you feel is right.

857
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,900
Just remember,
we're getting married in 3 months.

858
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:06,150
Your name glistens like a dewdrop.

859
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:12,320
You are what I dream of.

860
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:19,240
I see you everywhere.

861
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:24,530
My restless heart says.

862
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:27,200
Without you...

863
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,900
Without you, I am lost.

864
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:35,030
My heart is adrift

865
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:40,150
I'm lost without you, my love.

866
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:44,320
Without you, I am lost.

867
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,450
My heart is adrift

868
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:52,150
I'm lost without you, my love.

869
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:15,820
I call out to you.

870
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:20,950
In vain.

871
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:28,530
You're all that I want.

872
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:33,320
My heart can't be swayed.

873
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:39,400
Come, be a part of my world.

874
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:45,740
And fulfill all my desires.

875
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:48,320
Without you...

876
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:52,860
Without you, I am lost.

877
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,990
My heart is adrift

878
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:01,160
I'm lost without you, my love.

879
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:05,200
Without you, I am lost.

880
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:08,320
My heart is adrift

881
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:14,360
I'm lost without you, my love.

882
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:16,650
What are you doing here?

883
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,130
Junaid, do you think this is joke?

884
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,770
You can't get married.

885
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:23,610
Somebody might see us, please leave.

886
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:24,950
Leave from here?

887
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,400
But I'm carrying your baby...

888
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,990
Where should I go?

889
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:29,990
We will discuss about this later.

890
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,280
Please leave for now.

891
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,920
I'm not going anywhere...

892
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,160
And when will we talk?

893
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,820
You are getting married TODAY!

894
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,820
That's why I want you to leave,
before someone...

895
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:45,740
I am shattered and broken.

896
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:52,030
What is this bond we share?

897
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:58,200
I remain entangled in desire.

898
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:03,820
I don't know why.

899
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,490
Be my shade in the scorching sun.

900
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:16,650
Wipe my tears and bring me solace.

901
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:23,610
Come to me, my darling.

902
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,490
Firdaus, please listen to me.

903
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,490
It was a mistake.
You're the one I love.

904
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,860
If she had not come here today,
would you have ever cared to tell me?

905
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:45,030
Without you, I am lost.

906
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,310
My heart is adrift

907
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:52,680
I'm lost without you, my love.

908
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:57,620
Without you, I am lost.

909
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:00,570
My heart is adrift

910
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:05,860
I'm lost without you, my love.

911
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:35,780
You ignored me all the while but finally
removed the tattoo for the wedding!

912
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:37,110
Sir?

913
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,820
Congratulations!

914
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:41,360
The wedding was called off.

915
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,110
Have some tea.

916
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:48,410
Thank you.

917
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,720
Sir, I'm sorry for that day.

918
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,200
Why?

919
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:00,530
Rather I'm happy that
you went to Wular School.

920
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:04,320
The children got an opportunity
to learn from a good teacher like you.

921
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:07,070
Actually, I learnt a lot from them.

922
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:08,900
I really miss them.

923
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,150
Why don't you start teaching them again?

924
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:15,960
Don't they have a teacher?

925
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,320
They do. But he's not good.

926
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,860
Anyway, they'll need a
new teacher for the next term.

927
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:25,400
Would you like to go back?

928
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,200
You can even get your tattoo redone.

929
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,530
Let's teach Kabir sir that song today.

930
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,990
Yes.

931
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:04,360
Firdaus teacher! Yay!

932
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:11,530
I missed you so much!

933
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:12,280
Me too.

934
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,360
So did I.

935
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:14,900
How are you all?

936
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,610
You've grown so much in one year.

937
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:19,120
Kabir sir won't be coming?

938
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,120
Who is Kabir sir?

939
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,820
He was our teacher last year.

940
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:32,860
Have I grown taller?

941
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,200
Yes, quite a bit.

942
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:35,530
Go.

943
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:36,930
Come.

944
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,150
My superhero.

945
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,940
Soon you'll be as tall as me.

946
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,700
I want to be taller than you.

947
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,780
Okay!

948
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,860
I'm so happy to see
you back in school, Imran.

949
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,610
But, how did this happen?

950
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,610
Darkness cannot be conquered with light,
you need...

951
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:12,820
You mean darkness can't be driven by darkness
it can only be conquered with light.

952
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,740
How do you know this?

953
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,200
Kabir sir often mentioned.

954
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:07,400
Firdaus teacher, do you look like this?

955
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:10,210
Or may be like this?

956
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,360
Or this?

957
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,610
However you may look,

958
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:16,510
I love you, Firdaus.

959
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,940
People believe in love at first sight.

960
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,650
But I fell in love with
a girl I've never seen.

961
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:41,120
I've found a friend
in you that I have never had.

962
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,550
Firdaus, it's just not you.

963
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:47,980
I'm in love with your pole star,

964
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,860
your childhood,
your stubbornness, your anger,

965
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:52,540
Your a square plus b square In fact,
I love Junaid too.

966
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:57,220
By the way,
I've tried your statutory warning.

967
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:00,460
Thank you!

968
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,210
Though it was a lot of fun,
but the water was too cold!

969
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:11,720
You said thank the universe...

970
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,150
Well then, thank you Firdaus.

971
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,610
Because 'You' are my universe.

972
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:30,990
Firdaus, just like you, I too want to
pen down all my feelings in this notebook.

973
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,910
We may never meet,

974
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:37,170
but we will always be
together in this notebook.

975
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:53,030
I've loved chinar trees since childhood.

976
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,780
I had carried a leaf with
me when I had to leave Kashmir,

977
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,990
but I couldn't get
the leaf to grow in Jammu.

978
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:05,250
Sorry but I was too young to
know that leaves don't grow into trees.

979
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,070
"Where have these bloody.

980
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:10,900
"Kashmiris come from?" (TEASE)

981
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:14,110
"Where have these bloody"

982
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,870
I was teased so much at school
that I became the 'angry young man'.

983
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:27,270
I was filled with angry
for being thrown out of my home,

984
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,110
and hence I joined the
army to let out my anger.

985
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:54,320
But I was a misfit there as well.

986
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:56,990
Gunnu!

987
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:58,770
Hey Gunnu!!

988
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,320
One day a boy, running after his sheep,
crossed the border.

989
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,070
That day, my life changed!

990
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:09,520
Kabir sir, look, see what I found!

991
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,260
I've found a ball, made of metal.

992
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:17,320
Hey, what're you doing there?

993
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,000
Where have you come from?

994
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,210
Reply!!

995
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,440
Waqar! Throw it to me!
Towards me!

996
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,490
I won't give this to anyone!

997
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,130
Waqar!!!

998
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:44,390
Waqar!!!

999
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:52,260
Waqar!!!

1000
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:56,100
Don't go!

1001
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,130
Don't go there!!!

1002
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,940
There are landmines.

1003
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,540
Stop!

1004
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:08,490
There are landmines.

1005
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:14,710
Waqar!

1006
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,360
Don't go there!

1007
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:18,070
There are landmines.

1008
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:21,150
I won't give this to anyone!

1009
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:05,220
What's wrong, Kabir sir?

1010
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:13,280
Kabir sir?

1011
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,110
Thankfully nothing happened that day.

1012
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,740
It was a diffused grenade.

1013
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:24,490
I don't know what made me jump on it.

1014
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,280
Maybe I wanted to overcome my guilt.

1015
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,920
That boy ran not fearing
me but fearing my gun.

1016
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:47,820
That day I put down
my gun and left the army.

1017
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:57,190
What's up, Firdaus teacher?

1018
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,340
Nothing.

1019
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:04,210
Coochie coo, coochie coo...

1020
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:05,290
Tariq!

1021
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,020
Why haven't you solved these?

1022
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:16,940
I have a stomach ache.

1023
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:18,110
Me too.

1024
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:20,150
Same here.

1025
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:25,830
As the exams got closer,
it wasn't just the children...

1026
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:29,780
The math problems
made me nervous as well.

1027
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,220
I had grown up watching
Mahesh Bhatt films,

1028
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,220
far away from the world of Aryabhatta.

1029
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:42,240
When the children were writing their final
exam I felt it was my examination as well.

1030
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:44,176
The day the results were declared...

1031
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:51,230
I have passed the examination!
I have passed the examination!

1032
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,530
Imran...

1033
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,660
What are you doing?

1034
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:16,280
Listen to me.

1035
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:20,450
Imran...

1036
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:23,240
What are doing?

1037
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:27,290
Imran.

1038
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:29,920
Imran.

1039
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,370
Stop, Imran!

1040
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:38,070
Isn't this what you had taught?

1041
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,000
Sir, How did I fail then?

1042
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:41,670
How did I fail?

1043
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,530
I can't fail, sir.

1044
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:47,430
I can't fail..

1045
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:52,450
If I fail, my father will send me away.

1046
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,430
I don't want to go, sir.

1047
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:56,010
I don't want to go..

1048
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:01,450
You don't have to go anywhere.

1049
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,490
I promise!

1050
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:15,820
We can't continue like this.

1051
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,780
Imran is so intelligent;
How could he fail?

1052
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:21,280
I'm responsible for Imran's failure.

1053
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,070
I taught him the wrong thing.

1054
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,240
Good that you realise that.

1055
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:29,450
I believe,
you need to learn before you teach.

1056
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,990
Anyway, Firdaus teacher
will be back next term.

1057
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:34,740
So, I think you should take a break.

1058
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:37,070
What?

1059
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,160
Sorry, I think you should take a break.

1060
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:43,550
No sir, What did you say before that?

1061
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:45,030
Before what?

1062
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,310
Is Firdaus teacher coming back?
Yes.

1063
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,410
Why are you smiling?

1064
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:54,990
Nothing.

1065
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:59,490
I can't believe that you'll be back.

1066
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:02,370
The children will be very happy.

1067
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:06,700
Though they even accepted
a bad teacher like me,

1068
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,490
It's someone like you that they need.

1069
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,990
I'm keeping your notebook...

1070
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:19,770
I mean, our notebook, right here.

1071
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:25,120
Welcome back, Firdaus.

1072
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,200
Kabir.

1073
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:40,320
If you want to know more about me,
you can ask the school bell.

1074
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:46,260
Every time I missed you.
I would hold the rope of the bell.

1075
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,070
It made me feel as
if I was holding your hand.

1076
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,450
Love makes you do crazy things.

1077
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:04,870
Ms. Firdaus, there's been an
improvement in the children's marks.

1078
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:06,560
Thank you.

1079
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,870
No sir, thank you.

1080
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,950
May I ask you something?

1081
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,120
The teacher who taught last year,
Kabir sir...

1082
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:17,070
Do you know where he is?

1083
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:21,740
Why?

1084
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:25,700
I need to discuss some issues
about the children with him.

1085
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:27,330
Of course.

1086
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:32,630
I don't know where he is now, but he
planned to enroll for a teaching course.

1087
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:38,260
I have his application form here,
if you want to take a look.

1088
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:00,270
Can I help you?

1089
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:02,770
Does Kabir Kaul live here?

1090
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:03,940
No.

1091
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:07,440
It is his house,
but he doesn't live here anymore.

1092
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:08,920
He has moved to Jammu.

1093
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:12,900
He'd written this address
on the school's application form.

1094
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:14,440
That's why I'm here.

1095
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:15,700
And you are?

1096
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,730
I am Firdaus.

1097
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:18,020
I teach at Wular School.

1098
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:19,940
So you are Firdaus!

1099
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,020
Yes.

1100
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,020
And you are?

1101
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,520
Just like you're managing
Pandit ji's school,

1102
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,100
I'm looking after his house.

1103
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:34,900
Would you like some tea?

1104
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:42,820
Thank you.

1105
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,270
This house has its own story.

1106
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,900
I've seen it being built and
fall into ruins with my own eyes.

1107
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:57,520
Times were such that.

1108
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:01,560
Pandit ji had to move
out with his family.

1109
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:06,730
Strangely, this house
has been ravaged by locals...

1110
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:10,100
And also been looked after by locals...

1111
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:16,450
Especially Pandit ji's friend Mr.
Ahmed Qadri.

1112
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:22,480
Open the gate!

1113
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:26,940
Brother, open the gate.

1114
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:28,220
This gate won't open.

1115
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,460
What you're doing is wrong.

1116
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:31,916
Support us in the name of God.

1117
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,270
God supports my actions.

1118
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:35,090
You worry about yourselves.

1119
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:36,900
The Pandits have left.

1120
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:39,940
But you... have to live here.

1121
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:42,800
Decide if you want
to be our friend or...

1122
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,600
Think what you will.

1123
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:47,600
I won't let you enter Pandit
ji's house as long as I'm here.

1124
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:49,610
Go from here.

1125
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:53,150
Ahmed, open the gate!

1126
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,150
Mr. Qadri was one of a kind.

1127
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:03,730
God doesn't make men like him anymore.

1128
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,810
Did you know him?

1129
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,810
He is my father.

1130
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,310
Firdaus teacher?

1131
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:41,270
Hi.

1132
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:45,940
May I come in?

1133
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:46,980
Huh! Yes..

1134
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,900
Uncle Hameed said that
you were looking for me.

1135
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,900
That's why I've come.

1136
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,230
I can't believe you're here.

1137
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,440
Me neither.

1138
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:08,900
I've been waiting
for so long to meet you.

1139
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,900
But, we've already met.

1140
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,100
When?

1141
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:15,900
Look...

1142
01:35:20,190 --> 01:35:23,940
6 in the head, 7, 8, 9...

1143
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,730
Don't you know it? It's 11, stupid.

1144
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:28,100
I'm weak in math.

1145
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:30,230
But, how do you calculate so fast?

1146
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:31,900
Pandit ji taught me to.

1147
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:53,310
You'll be on my mind.

1148
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:59,940
Like I will be on yours.

1149
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:04,810
You will be as proud of me.

1150
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:10,560
As I am of you.

1151
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:19,900
We will be known as Romeo and Juliet.

1152
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:30,190
There will one such day.

1153
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:37,900
There will one such day.

1154
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:43,230
- Brother...
- Yes?

1155
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:45,230
The battery has run out in the school.

1156
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,706
Can you send another one, please?
I'm facing a lot of problems.

1157
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:49,140
Sure. It'll be done today.

1158
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:51,270
Thank you.
There's a letter for you.

1159
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,270
I've given it to Waqar.

1160
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:54,510
Who is it from?

1161
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,650
Kabir sir.

1162
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:04,900
To Firdaus teacher...

1163
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:19,130
Waqar, there's no water inside.

1164
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:22,060
Now what will you do without water?

1165
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:28,270
Waqar!

1166
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:30,480
Were you given a letter?

1167
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:32,190
Where is it?

1168
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,270
I dropped it.

1169
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,560
In the toilet?

1170
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,270
But, I have read it.

1171
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:48,060
What did it say?

1172
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,190
I am coming...

1173
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,850
Is Kabir sir coming?

1174
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,100
When?

1175
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:02,690
I dropped it before...

1176
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:11,100
Night will turn to day.

1177
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:17,900
When we'll get together.

1178
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:26,650
Heaven and earth will come alive.

1179
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:32,940
When we'll get together.

1180
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:41,230
This yearning for each other,

1181
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:45,370
This longing...

1182
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:48,980
Will be all around,

1183
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,900
You'll see.

1184
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:57,350
You will make some mistakes.

1185
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:03,940
And so will I.

1186
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:08,500
You will be as proud of me.

1187
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:14,630
As I am of you.

1188
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:23,810
We will be known as Romeo and Juliet.

1189
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:29,270
Go.

1190
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:34,150
Imran, turn right.

1191
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,650
Keep going straight.
Firdaus teacher, which way now?

1192
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:51,410
Let's go, Imran.

1193
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:53,170
Brother, please...

1194
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:58,240
I've already told you
not to give them false hope.

1195
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:00,600
Stay away from them.

1196
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,480
This is your last warning.

1197
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:04,480
Let's go, Imran.

1198
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:06,190
I don't want to go.

1199
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,270
Sir, you'd said that you
wouldn't let me go anywhere.

1200
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:24,770
Father has come to take me away.

1201
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:47,820
Let's go, Imran.

1202
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,600
As-salaam-alaykum,
I'm Imran's teacher, Kabir.

1203
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:52,390
Sir, please let him study.

1204
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:53,430
Let go of my hand.

1205
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:54,900
It's important for him to study.

1206
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:56,230
If he doesn't study...

1207
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:56,900
Let go of my hand.

1208
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:59,500
Sir...

1209
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,150
Please don't hit him.

1210
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:02,100
- Father, please.
- Let go of my hand teacher!

1211
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:02,900
Sir, I...

1212
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:05,300
- Father, don't...
- Let go of my hand.

1213
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:07,190
Don't hit him.

1214
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,060
Sir, please let Imran stay.

1215
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:10,810
- Don't hit him.
- Leave my hand.

1216
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:12,900
Father... No.

1217
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:14,906
I've promised Imran...
Leave my hand.

1218
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:16,180
Don't, father...

1219
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:18,170
- Please...
- Stay away!

1220
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:23,590
Please don't hit him.

1221
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,680
Sir,

1222
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:27,730
I won't let you take him away.
No father...

1223
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:30,150
Will you stop me? You?
Father, don't...

1224
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:55,320
Please don't hit him.

1225
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,560
I said leave my hand.

1226
01:42:57,730 --> 01:42:59,310
Don't hit him, father.

1227
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:02,660
- Give me the gun.
- No.

1228
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,100
Give me the gun, Imran!

1229
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,060
Give me the gun, Imran!

1230
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:13,900
Give me the gun...

1231
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,690
Give me the gun...

1232
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:20,270
Give me the gun, Imran!

1233
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,850
Give me the gun...

1234
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:24,650
Give me the gun...

1235
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:26,230
Give me the gun...

1236
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:29,480
Give me the gun...

1237
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,100
Give me the gun...

1238
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:33,150
Give me the gun...

1239
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:47,940
What's this?

1240
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,600
What're you doing, Imran?

1241
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:58,810
Put the gun down.

1242
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:01,900
If I put it down, he will kill you.

1243
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:03,900
Let him!

1244
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:05,940
But you will not shoot.

1245
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:10,350
Imran...

1246
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,020
If there's anything
that you've learnt from me,

1247
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:14,900
if you think I'm your teacher,

1248
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:17,220
put the gun down.

1249
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:22,600
Don't make the same mistake
your father had made.

1250
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:27,730
If you don't put the gun down,
then I will fail.

1251
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:30,650
Firdaus teacher will fail.

1252
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,230
Our teaching will fail.

1253
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:37,650
Please put the gun down.

1254
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:39,790
For us.

1255
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,230
Hi.

1256
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,520
Hi.

1257
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:45,310
Kabir sir.

1258
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:47,810
Firdaus teacher.

1259
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:50,190
Nice to finally meet you.

1260
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,810
Nice to meet you too.

1261
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:19,620
Why did you read my personal notebook?

1262
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,260
It's only after reading it
that I realised, it was personal.

1263
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:29,940
Where are the children?

1264
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:31,310
I've sent them home.

1265
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:36,560
