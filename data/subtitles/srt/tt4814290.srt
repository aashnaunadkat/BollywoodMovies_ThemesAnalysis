1
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,501
What did you steal old man?

2
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,501
Then why are you sitting here?

3
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,751
Madam, I cannot handle
this old man anymore.

4
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:07,501
He's here again.

5
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:11,626
You go, I'll take care of it.
- Okay, madam.

6
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,460
Look..the bitch is coming.

7
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,626
Let's go there.

8
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:26,001
How are you?

9
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,376
Same.

10
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:31,710
Did you find anything?

11
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:38,626
For the past <i>8</i> years..you've
been asking the same question.

12
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:41,835
I don't have..anything else to ask.

13
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:51,835
What's the point of
coming here every day?

14
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,085
I will inform you if I find anything.

15
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,501
Instead of spending your
time with your beautiful wife..

16
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:01,626
...you're wasting your time here.

17
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:06,460
I come here for my wife.

18
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:13,626
Unless I visit the police
station once a day..

19
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,001
...she doesn't feel at peace.

20
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:23,626
Okay, you go home now, John uncle.

21
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,876
I let you know as
soon as I find something.

22
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:31,210
Okay.

23
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,251
Thank you.
I'll come back tomorrow then.

24
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:54,585
Oh God!

25
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:20,001
John, what dish is this?

26
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,001
I don't know what it's called,
saw it on TV.

27
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:25,710
You remember the recipe.
but you don't remember the name

28
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:27,085
Really?

29
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,876
There's always another
way to find out.

30
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:36,626
Looks like you remember
only half the recipe.

31
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:46,960
It seems I've invented a new dish.

32
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,960
Have you paid the bills, John?

33
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,251
They had sent a message.

34
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:54,085
No.

35
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:59,835
It was too late by the time
I left the Police Station.

36
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:01,585
I'll do it tomorrow.

37
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:06,751
You remember to go
to the Police Station..

38
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:08,960
...but not the household chores.

39
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,626
How long will you keep
going to the Police Station?

40
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,251
How long will you keep
sitting there all day?

41
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:20,751
When will this all end?

42
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:23,751
Until I get justice.

43
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:32,876
<i>The sound of your laughter,
like a Xylophone...</i>

44
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:36,126
<i>I hear it even today..</i>

45
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:43,585
<i>Your fragrance lingers on..</i>

46
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:48,376
<i>Though you're long gone..</i>

47
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:56,835
<i>Your place in the house..</i>

48
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:02,501
<i>Your barren bed..</i>

49
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:13,710
<i>I</i> sense you everywhere,
despite <i>your</i> absence"

50
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:21,376
<i>Why.. O why?</i>

51
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:27,751
<i>Why did you leave me alone?</i>

52
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:34,376
<i>Why.. O why?</i>

53
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:41,710
<i>The shards of memories
are all that remain.</i>

54
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:44,876
We don't want the police here.
You can go.

55
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:48,376
Please come..
Please come with me.

56
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:50,626
All this..

57
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:53,376
All this is their fault!

58
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,001
It's your fault.

59
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,001
Stop this charade.

60
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,835
If you loved her so much,
then you should've taken care of her.

61
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:09,501
The reason my daughter is
dead is because of you, John.

62
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,001
Only your fault.

63
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:22,210
<i>I continue to keep your
things in their place..</i>

64
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:28,251
<i>In silence, I stare at them..</i>

65
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:34,585
<i>I'll wait for your return...</i>

66
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:40,376
Nothing more that <i>I</i> can do..

67
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:51,126
<i>Let me untangle once again,
your curly locks of hair.</i>

68
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,501
I was going to get this earlier.

69
00:11:57,043 --> 00:12:02,501
I troubled your grandma..to
finish this quickly.

70
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:06,501
Our Angela is growing up pretty fast.

71
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:12,126
<i>Why.. O why?</i>

72
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:14,376
I'll take the old one back.

73
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:21,626
<i>The shards of memories
are all that remain.</i>

74
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,335
We love you, sweetheart.

75
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:36,501
And we miss you.

76
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:58,668
Hello.
- Hello.

77
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:00,751
Can you please call him.
- Who? Martin?

78
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,335
Sure.
- Thank you.

79
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:05,751
Lord..we expect your blessings.

80
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:07,001
Father..

81
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:10,001
One minute.

82
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:17,626
Lord..we expect your blessings.

83
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:22,168
And request that the departed soul..

84
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,251
Father, I am getting married.

85
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:25,751
It's not a funeral.

86
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,251
Doesn't make a difference.

87
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:31,376
There is not much of a difference.
- What?

88
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:34,210
Soon you will realize that.

89
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,126
Take a good look at her and imagine..

90
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:41,626
...how will she look
when she grows old,

91
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:44,001
Think and decide.

92
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:45,876
I've decided father.

93
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:47,001
I do.

94
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,501
It can only warn you.

95
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:50,835
Ms. Kaveri Paul, you ready.

96
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,001
Yes.

97
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:03,501
John Uncle.. I am sorry,
he can't meet you today.

98
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:06,876
He had to leave urgently.

99
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,626
Go inside and tell him..

100
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:19,626
...just by changing uniforms
a policeman cannot become a Priest.

101
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:26,835
If he was a real priest he
wouldn't have lied just to avoid me.

102
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:57,751
"Grandpa...! Grandpa...!"

103
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:00,251
"I am sorry, grandpa."

104
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,001
"I made a mistake."

105
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,126
"I should have listened to you.."

106
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:11,710
"I should have listened to you.."
"I should have listened to you.."

107
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,376
"I should have listened to you."

108
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:31,876
"I shouldn't have
taken the other route."

109
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:05,501
Last time she was seen
in her school uniform..

110
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:06,626
...with a cap on her head.

111
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:07,501
Understand?

112
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:11,126
During the afternoons
Rippon Street is almost empty.

113
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:14,751
At around 2pm she
was abducted from there.

114
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:18,001
There was an eye-witness
who saw that black van.

115
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:01,001
Who is it?
- Martin.

116
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:21,626
How are you?

117
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:22,918
Fine.

118
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,751
I hope John is giving you
the medicines on time?

119
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,376
What brings you here today?

120
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,585
Where is that crazy guy.
I don't see him here.

121
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:30,501
He's gone to the market.

122
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:32,960
Listen..

123
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:36,460
Do I look like a fool?

124
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:39,793
Last week I bought
the same fish from you.

125
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,626
How can it suddenly
become so expensive?

126
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:44,376
Sir, the elections
are round the corner.

127
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:45,043
<i>Thais why...</i>

128
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,918
...the party-workers are distributing
fish amongst the people to encash votes.

129
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:49,501
So the prices have soared.

130
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,751
Last week you had said the
'prawns' have became expensive..

131
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:55,460
...due to the earthquake in Japan.

132
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:58,043
What can I do?
I didn't cause the earthquake.

133
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:58,751
Rubbish!

134
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:00,043
Listen..

135
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:02,293
How many kilograms do you want?
- I don't want any.

136
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,251
Now I'll only eat fish
after the elections are over.

137
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:25,335
Last evening your husband had
come to meet me at the church.

138
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,626
And he left behind half
a kilogram of guilt.

139
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,460
Couldn't sleep all night.
Kept thinking about it...

140
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:32,751
So I came here.

141
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:35,501
So you managed to dodge
him again?

142
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:37,626
I had to literally sneak away.

143
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:44,626
What happened?

144
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:49,376
Even John makes better tea than this.
- Yes.. but..

145
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:52,251
Something must be
wrong with the milk.

146
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,335
Who brought it? John?
- Yes.

147
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:55,501
No wonder.

148
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:09,001
Martin..John needs your help.

149
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:15,501
He keeps listening to the same tape
every night, over and over again.

150
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:20,251
He thinks I am asleep,
and I don't know anything.

151
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:24,585
Please.

152
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:38,751
"No..no..Angela, you didn't
make any mistake."

153
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,543
"You will be fine..
you will be fine, dear! Don't worry."

154
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:44,043
"Grandpa! Grandpa!"

155
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,001
"Are you assured now?"

156
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:47,668
"I will tell you where
to bring the money."

157
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:54,001
"I will tell you."

158
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:58,001
"I will tell you."

159
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:10,626
I will talk to him.

160
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,876
Dear, where did you
get this cap from?

161
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:28,126
This..this cap?

162
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:29,501
Who gave you?

163
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,751
Who is this?

164
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:41,501
Excuse me, sir.
I don't want to disturb you.

165
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:46,126
I just want to know from
where did the girl get the cap?

166
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,626
It belongs to her.
- But...

167
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:55,585
Sir. Sir..that's not her cap.

168
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:57,876
My wife made that cap for...

169
00:21:58,668 --> 00:21:59,626
This cap..

170
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:07,626
Isn't it illegal to
make them work like this?

171
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:09,835
The cap was donated.

172
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:12,626
Who..who donated it?
- I don't know.

173
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:14,126
You must have some records.

174
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,793
Maybe, but I don't
have the time for all that.

175
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,501
Please, it's very important.
It's really very important.

176
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,251
Please leave, I've other things to do.

177
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,876
If you want I can make
a donation to the orphanage.

178
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:28,376
Here you go.

179
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:30,460
<i>We got it from lmambara.
- Huh!</i>

180
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,501
<i>lmambara. lmambara.</i>

181
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:36,335
The one in Hooghly?

182
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:39,751
How much are you going to donate?

183
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,585
Where were you, John?

184
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:11,751
The fan has stopped working again.

185
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:29,210
Where are the groceries?
- Huh?

186
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,876
Where are the groceries?

187
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,335
I forgot.

188
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,251
Are you alright?
- Yeah.

189
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,126
Oh God..

190
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,710
John!
- Huh!

191
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:55,001
Father Martin had come
to see you in the morning.

192
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:56,501
Yeah..

193
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:04,126
How are you, John?

194
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:07,251
Won't you come inside?

195
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:13,001
I seek justice from the Law, not God.

196
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:15,501
This..

197
00:24:16,043 --> 00:24:18,251
It's the same cap.

198
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,251
She was wearing this
when she was kidnapped.

199
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,460
Look..

200
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,043
A.. R..

201
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:26,501
Angela Roy..

202
00:24:26,668 --> 00:24:27,543
Where did you..

203
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:29,126
A little girl from the..

204
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:33,501
...'Little Flowers Deaf'n'Dumb'
Orphanage was wearing it.

205
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:37,626
<i>You know the lmambara..at Hooghly.</i>

206
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,876
It was donated to the orphanage
by them.

207
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:41,501
How did it get there?

208
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,210
Who gave it to them?

209
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,751
We must follow this trail?

210
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:47,960
We can find the kidnapper.

211
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:52,210
John, it's been 8 years.

212
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:54,251
Why don't you forget it..

213
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,751
And find another way to attain peace.

214
00:24:57,918 --> 00:24:59,626
Martin. Martin.

215
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:13,501
I am not going to run away
from the situation like you..

216
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:15,585
Inspector Martin.

217
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:19,543
You are trying to shy away
from your responsibilities..

218
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:22,001
...by becoming a priest now.

219
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:25,460
You're only trying to hide behind
those white robes.

220
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:30,501
You had promised me.

221
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:33,376
You forgot, but I didn't.

222
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:41,543
You always fail to understand.

223
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:43,376
That crime was never repeated again.

224
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:44,626
Criminals are creatures of mind..

225
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,376
...they can change their
location but not their habits.

226
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:48,251
I am sure he left the city.

227
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:50,751
It's almost impossible to find him.

228
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:00,126
My heart says..l'll
surely find something.

229
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,793
"Justice? How will you get justice?"

230
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,501
<i>For that we need
to get to the lmambara.</i>

231
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:06,376
Your scooter is a piece of junk.
How about my bike?

232
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:15,251
<i>Do you know anyone at the Imambara?
- No.</i>

233
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:45,751
Yes.

234
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:49,876
Little Flowers Orphanage.

235
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,126
Yes, here it is.

236
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:55,960
We had sent them these items.

237
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:58,501
In the month of December..

238
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:01,126
...the graveyard wall was extended.

239
00:27:01,293 --> 00:27:06,251
We found an aluminum box,
during the dig that time.

240
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:11,126
And this cap was one of
the items we found in it.

241
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:13,710
Was there anything
else in that trunk?

242
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,751
I don't remember clearly.

243
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:19,168
Items that were still usable
were donated to the orphanage..

244
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,251
...and other items were thrown away.

245
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:26,210
God knows since how long
it was lying there.

246
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:28,251
Since 8 years!

247
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:30,751
How do you know?
- Thanks for your help.

248
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:33,626
No, no, wait..
we need some more help.

249
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:40,501
Can you show me the exact
spot where you found this trunk?

250
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,460
We might find something buried there.

251
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:46,876
Now there are only graves there.

252
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:50,501
Only dead bodies buried in.
Nothing more.

253
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:55,751
<i>Before it became
a part of the lmambara..</i>

254
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:58,126
...who did this land belong to?

255
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:00,835
I'll have to check the records.

256
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:21,876
Uncle John..what are you doing here?

257
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:22,876
I am looking for..

258
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:25,251
Still looking for a property
for your son-in-law.

259
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:28,751
We needed some information
about the Shah family.

260
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:30,251
But they are settled in USA.

261
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,835
It's been more than 25 years.

262
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,251
I handle all their paperwork.

263
00:28:34,543 --> 00:28:36,460
It's not easy to deal with the NRIs.

264
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:37,918
But we had heard that they..

265
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:40,876
<i>..Donated a part of their
property to the lmambara.</i>

266
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:42,126
Yes, they did.
- So?

267
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:44,876
That's why Mr.Shah himself had came
here last year.

268
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:46,501
<i>He donated the land to the lmambara..</i>

269
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,751
...and gave me the job
to find a buyer for the house.

270
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:53,335
8 years ago..in October..

271
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:57,251
Was anyone from his family here?
- No.

272
00:28:57,918 --> 00:28:59,001
There was no one.

273
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:31,001
You must start coming
to the church again.

274
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,126
Instead of clawing at your wounds..

275
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,876
...find a way to heal them.

276
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,376
Did your wounds heal..
Father Martin?

277
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:53,335
<i>It's common belief that life
is nothing but few lines of fate...</i>

278
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:59,376
<i>Unfortunate I am,
to have witnessed this day.</i>

279
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:05,960
<i>The many dreams I had for you.</i>

280
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:12,210
<i>How do I let go of them?</i>

281
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:19,585
<i>Gasps of anguish
escape my ageing heart..</i>

282
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:26,126
<i>..for the many unfulfilled desires.</i>

283
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:31,251
<i>Why.. O why?</i>

284
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:37,376
<i>Why did you leave me alone?</i>

285
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:43,335
<i>Why.. O why?</i>

286
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:53,001
<i>The shards of memories
are all that remain</i>

287
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:39,251
Mom! Mom!
Open the door, mom!

288
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:42,001
Mom! Open the door!
- What happened?

289
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,335
He was coming to catch me.

290
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:47,960
Come on, grandpa, you can do it.

291
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:51,251
Yes.. yes.. goal.

292
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:52,501
Oh no!

293
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:55,126
Come on, Ronnie. Once again.

294
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:58,043
No, grandpa.
You don't know how to play.

295
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,876
Can I go play on the ground?

296
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:01,626
No, play here.
Not on the ground.

297
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:02,960
Okay-

298
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:10,376
Hello.

299
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:46,376
Ronnie!

300
00:33:48,251 --> 00:33:49,085
Ronnie!

301
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:55,751
Hello.

302
00:33:58,043 --> 00:33:58,710
What?

303
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:00,835
Who's speaking?

304
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:26,126
I was playing football
with my grandson there..

305
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:27,751
...right where the car is parked.

306
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,335
Just then my landline
started ringing.

307
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,876
I came upstairs to answer the phone.

308
00:34:33,376 --> 00:34:37,126
But..by the time I could answer,
the call got disconnected.

309
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:40,710
After that when I went down,
I couldn't see Ronnie anywhere.

310
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,710
I called for him, but..

311
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,335
Neeta.

312
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,501
After that, I received
a call on my mobile phone.

313
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:51,501
I don't know who he was,
but he said..

314
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:55,751
"If you want Ronnie back,
then do as I say."

315
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:59,126
Neeta, no..
- Why my son, papa?

316
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:02,251
No, dear. You will fall sick.

317
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:07,001
Found anything?

318
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:09,626
The call was made
from a prepaid number.

319
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,501
Tell the service provider
to track the number.

320
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:14,460
Sure.

321
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:22,876
Send it to all the stations?
- Yes.

322
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:24,168
Excuse me.

323
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:25,251
Yeah.
- Done.

324
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:28,876
Mr. Sinha.

325
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:35,501
He may call again.

326
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,751
We're tapping your calls
on the mobile..even your landline.

327
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:39,501
Thank you.

328
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:42,376
But what is your plan?

329
00:35:42,793 --> 00:35:45,210
Is there a threat to
Ronnie's life if you stay here?

330
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:49,168
What if the kidnapper finds out
that I've informed the police..

331
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:51,126
...then, he might do something.

332
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:55,376
If you want to save the child,
then the police are your only hope.

333
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:03,918
I need details of the
kidnapping reported last week.

334
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:05,835
Immediately.
- Okay, madam.

335
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:07,585
And listen..

336
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,460
I also want the case
files of John Biswas.

337
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,960
The 8 year old kidnapping case.

338
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:16,751
Okay, madam.

339
00:36:18,918 --> 00:36:21,251
I am deeply shocked about his death.

340
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:23,418
May the almighty grant him salvation!

341
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:25,168
That's all I can say.

342
00:36:25,168 --> 00:36:26,585
Goodbye.

343
00:36:30,043 --> 00:36:33,001
Sir, if I couldn't remember
anything yesterday..

344
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:35,126
...how can you expect
a miracle to happen today!

345
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:37,751
What's the point in
coming here every day?

346
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:43,335
This is the first clue in 8 years.

347
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:46,085
I can't ignore it so easily.

348
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,126
Yes.

349
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:20,751
What are you doing here?

350
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:23,376
Getting married.

351
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,001
Soon.

352
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:28,460
What?

353
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:36,501
That's bad news.. I mean a big news.

354
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:38,126
Why do you look so surprised?

355
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:43,126
I am not that bad looking.
- No, I mean..

356
00:37:44,543 --> 00:37:46,376
You are..

357
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,501
I am what, father?

358
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:54,710
I mean, you are..

359
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:57,085
Come on, father.

360
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:59,210
Say what's on your mind.

361
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:05,126
There's no one here except for you,
me and God.

362
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:10,126
Are you really getting married?

363
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:15,626
No!

364
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:26,126
A child has been kidnapped.

365
00:38:45,418 --> 00:38:46,751
What now?

366
00:38:47,168 --> 00:38:49,126
Please get back to your work.

367
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:52,126
My scooter is giving me some trouble.

368
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:54,751
Do you have
a spare wire or something?

369
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,210
The spark-plug has got choked,
I'll have to clean it.

370
00:38:58,543 --> 00:38:59,876
Sometimes it gives me trouble.

371
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:03,751
Otherwise it flies like an airplane.

372
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:06,001
Wait here, I will check.
- Sure.

373
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:11,876
I read your case files .. It
looks like the same criminal is back.

374
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:14,335
What's the connection
with the <i>8</i> year old case?

375
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:15,876
No, no, you're thinking
in the wrong direction.

376
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,376
Both the cases are
completely different.

377
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:18,793
Think about it.

378
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,835
You couldn't catch him last time.

379
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:23,876
So this time he's giving
you another opportunity.

380
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,126
I don't want a second chance.

381
00:39:26,418 --> 00:39:27,751
Thank you very much.

382
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:30,501
Even to tell him that,
you've to catch him first.

383
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:36,376
Please help me.

384
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,460
I've never dealt with
a kidnapping case before.

385
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:42,876
And you have been an expert on this.

386
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,751
Was that a joke or a taunt?

387
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:48,251
I am asking for your help?

388
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:51,501
You can take all the
help from the old case files.

389
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:53,376
I came here because
I have already read them.

390
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:55,210
What's your problem, Martin?

391
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:59,126
Sorry.

392
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,376
Father Martin!

393
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:05,626
There's no harm if you
read the current case file once.

394
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:07,251
I've forgotten everything.

395
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:09,335
That's why..
- Leave everything to God..

396
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:13,751
We try to give ourselves
undue importance.

397
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:21,335
I see.. so now that's
the solution to all your problems.

398
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:27,501
Those who can't help themselves,
can never be of any help to God.

399
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,210
Now it's God's turn.

400
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:33,126
You've already
disappointed everyone else.

401
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:36,626
John, the police department..

402
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:40,001
...and me!

403
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:55,126
See, maybe you can
find something useful in this.

404
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:57,626
Thank you. Thank you.

405
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:14,168
Thank you. It's fixed.

406
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:17,418
Thanks to this
this pen and this wire.

407
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:18,751
Great.
- My job's done.

408
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:21,626
Thank you. Thank you.

409
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:30,710
Sir.

410
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:34,460
Wait..wait, sir.
Wait.

411
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,710
It took two months, but the
finally a miracle has happened.

412
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:41,126
This incident
reminded me of something else.

413
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:42,751
I didn't understand.

414
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,335
This pen was in that trunk as well.

415
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:47,001
It completely slipped out of my mind.

416
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:48,460
Look.

417
00:41:54,418 --> 00:41:55,251
Madam.

418
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:00,710
We can't find her father.

419
00:42:02,168 --> 00:42:03,335
Let him be.

420
00:42:03,793 --> 00:42:06,210
Maybe he doesn't want to talk
to the kidnapper in front of us.

421
00:42:06,751 --> 00:42:08,626
He's concerned about Ronnie's safety.

422
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,501
$0..

423
00:42:14,543 --> 00:42:16,626
Father Martin! You?

424
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:18,710
How did you leave God alone today?

425
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:24,501
Sister.. What happened?

426
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,418
She had a heart
surgery many years ago.

427
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:28,543
Her heart is weak.

428
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:29,918
And she can't handle too much stress.

429
00:42:29,918 --> 00:42:31,835
Call the doctor.
- Yes, ma'am.

430
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:33,626
Careful.

431
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:36,168
Give her some water.

432
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:40,001
Where's her husband?
- In the army.

433
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:41,585
He's posted in the North East.

434
00:42:42,418 --> 00:42:45,251
He's been informed and will
be here by evening.

435
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:47,460
But madam,
what if the kidnapper calls now?

436
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:50,626
I'll pretend to be
the mother and talk to him.

437
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:52,168
Yes, what if..

438
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:54,960
If he finds out that
I am not the mother..

439
00:42:55,501 --> 00:43:00,001
...then we'll know that
he knows the family really well.

440
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,376
But why isn't he calling?

441
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:46,251
Hello.

442
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:48,376
Grandpa! Help!

443
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,168
Ronnie. How are you son?
- Please save me.

444
00:43:51,168 --> 00:43:53,376
Grandpa won't let
anything happen to you.

445
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:54,418
Just don't worry.

446
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:55,751
Grandpa! Help...!

447
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:18,751
Hello.

448
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:20,751
Why did you call the police?

449
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:22,626
Your grandchild is in my custody.

450
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:24,376
So stop wasting my time.

451
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:27,543
If you want him back alive then arrange
for two million by tomorrow morning.

452
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:28,876
I will call again.

453
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,126
Hello, I am his mother speaking.

454
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:33,626
Is my son alright?

455
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:36,126
I want evidence that he's alright.

456
00:45:37,793 --> 00:45:40,001
Hello.. Hello..

457
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:43,960
Find anything?

458
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:46,126
No, madam..we had very little time.

459
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:52,626
But yes, we have tracked a 2-3
kilometer radius around his location.

460
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,126
Send details to all the police units.
- Yes.

461
00:45:56,126 --> 00:45:58,501
Where's Manohar? Call him.

462
00:45:58,793 --> 00:45:59,626
Yes, madam.

463
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,376
He left his mobile
here and disappeared.

464
00:46:13,043 --> 00:46:13,918
It's okay.

465
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:15,501
Leave a message for him at home.

466
00:46:16,001 --> 00:46:18,043
The other units have already
left for the location..

467
00:46:18,043 --> 00:46:20,376
I am going there but you stay here.
- Yes, madam.

468
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:39,210
John. What is this paper?
- Huh!

469
00:46:39,668 --> 00:46:43,210
It's just a logo, that's all.

470
00:46:43,876 --> 00:46:45,876
Seems like a bird.

471
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:49,210
I've seen it before.

472
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,251
John!! When you
were buying the property for Peter..

473
00:46:56,418 --> 00:47:00,460
...those documents
had the same symbol..remember..

474
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:20,335
The property papers were right here.

475
00:47:21,293 --> 00:47:23,376
Where are they?
- I don't know.

476
00:47:24,168 --> 00:47:25,751
Maybe Peter took it with him.

477
00:47:36,168 --> 00:47:37,376
Where are you going?

478
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:42,126
There's something I need to do.
- What?

479
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:48,376
I've finally got my hands
on something concrete, Nancy.

480
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:52,001
Something which the police..
- Enough John.

481
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:55,085
That's enough.

482
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:58,126
When will this end?

483
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:19,376
I couldn't do anything
for my daughter.

484
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:29,126
And after she was gone, I couldn't
take care of our Angela also.

485
00:48:30,876 --> 00:48:34,960
I can't sleep at night.

486
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:43,626
I have to find the man
who took Angela away from us.

487
00:48:48,043 --> 00:48:54,876
And I promise you.. I will find him.

488
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:06,543
Tell me John uncle.

489
00:50:06,543 --> 00:50:08,126
Do you want to sell
or buy a property this time?

490
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:09,501
Well..

491
00:50:09,918 --> 00:50:12,001
When we were buying the
property for Peter..

492
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:17,126
...this logo was on one of the papers.

493
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:20,043
Which company does it belong to?
- This.

494
00:50:20,043 --> 00:50:21,210
It's logo of the government office.

495
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,918
This symbol belongs to the
Land Measurement Office.

496
00:50:23,918 --> 00:50:24,668
What happened?

497
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:27,335
Can you give me the
address of that office?

498
00:50:27,876 --> 00:50:29,001
Tell me what you need uncle.

499
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:30,376
I can get your job done.

500
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:31,876
I've many contacts.

501
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:34,668
But if you want to deal with some
other agent, then that's different.

502
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:37,251
No, no, just give me the address.

503
00:50:37,543 --> 00:50:41,501
A friend of mine needs it..
he's got some personal work there.

504
00:50:42,043 --> 00:50:42,626
Sure?

505
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:44,126
Fine!

506
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,001
Sarita, there's one
thing that is bothering me.

507
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:50,001
The ransom call that was made...

508
00:50:50,168 --> 00:50:52,376
We found no fingerprints
on the phone.

509
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:53,710
He cleaned everything.

510
00:50:54,043 --> 00:50:56,376
No, no..l am saying
something else here.

511
00:50:56,918 --> 00:50:58,626
The ransom call that we received..

512
00:50:58,793 --> 00:51:00,376
...we could hear traffic at the back.

513
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:06,251
But..there was no traffic around
the PCO from where the call was made.

514
00:51:09,626 --> 00:51:11,543
But the service provider
confirmed the location.

515
00:51:11,543 --> 00:51:13,376
...that's where the call came from.

516
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:18,376
Let's wait for the lab
reports on the cigarette butt.

517
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,876
This was a corporate gift.

518
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:55,626
Given by a big builder in
the year 2006-2007.

519
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:57,335
To all the employees.

520
00:52:58,043 --> 00:53:02,001
How many people
worked here back then?

521
00:53:02,876 --> 00:53:06,626
Around 2000 people..
- 2000?

522
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:08,751
That's a rough figure. Could be more.

523
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:13,501
Can I get a list of their names?

524
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:17,085
Go to the Administrative Department,
and find out yourself.

525
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:17,876
Go on.

526
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:19,376
This way.
- Yes.

527
00:53:20,251 --> 00:53:22,126
I've come from very far, son.

528
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:25,960
I want to sell my land
before my daughter's marriage.

529
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:27,335
That's not my problem.

530
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:29,376
There are so many
old cases still pending.

531
00:53:30,668 --> 00:53:32,585
You will have to wait
for at least a month.

532
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:33,960
Please go.

533
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:35,335
Next!

534
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:41,626
What happened, uncle?

535
00:53:42,043 --> 00:53:44,376
He said it will take a month.

536
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:46,126
One month.. that's nonsense.

537
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,126
Give me your phone number.

538
00:53:48,376 --> 00:53:49,876
The manager is my cousin.

539
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:51,876
But...
- I'll call him and get your job done.

540
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:55,543
You see, this is not
the way to get things done..

541
00:53:55,543 --> 00:53:57,376
Who is John Biswas?

542
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:58,501
Please come with me.

543
00:53:58,876 --> 00:54:01,001
Come with me, I'll solve your problem.

544
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:05,835
Look, sir,
I am really surprised by your request.

545
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:11,251
You want our 8-9 year
old employee records

546
00:54:12,418 --> 00:54:14,876
for some
kidnapping investigation.

547
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,751
Not only kidnapping.. also murder.

548
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:21,626
The child who was
kidnapped didn't survive.

549
00:54:22,418 --> 00:54:27,001
But we didn't received any
such requests from the police.

550
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:32,001
The case isn't closed yet.
It's still being investigated.

551
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,835
And the kidnapper is roaming free.

552
00:54:35,126 --> 00:54:35,793
And you know..

553
00:54:35,793 --> 00:54:38,626
Sir, why you don't
understand what I am saying.

554
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,335
Why didn't the police
send us an official request?

555
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:48,085
Well l..can get a written order
from the police if you want..

556
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:49,626
...but you know,
these things take time.

557
00:54:49,626 --> 00:54:52,126
If you can help me out,
I'll be..

558
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:55,751
Look sir,
when you have waited for 8-9 years..

559
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,251
...so a few more weeks
shouldn't matter.

560
00:54:57,543 --> 00:55:00,501
I suggest you to get the
police to send us a request..

561
00:55:01,418 --> 00:55:02,376
...and we'll do the rest.

562
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:09,626
Sir, maybe you can treat this case
as an exception and help me out.

563
00:55:09,918 --> 00:55:12,168
This list is very important for me.

564
00:55:12,168 --> 00:55:14,626
A new lead will really help me a lot.

565
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:17,876
Please..I am busy. You may go now..

566
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:55,126
Hello sir, am I late?
- No.. no.

567
00:55:56,293 --> 00:55:58,251
Would you like something to eat?
- No, sir. I am fine.

568
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:00,835
Here you go.

569
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,918
These are the entire
records you had asked for..

570
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:05,501
...I think this will be useful to you.

571
00:56:08,293 --> 00:56:12,501
Sir, is there fuel in the tank?
- Huh?

572
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:15,376
Is there fuel in the tank? - Yes.

573
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:18,126
There should
be around 1-2 liters.

574
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:20,376
Okay fine. Thank you, sir.

575
00:56:23,168 --> 00:56:25,251
I came directly from work.

576
00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:33,376
Give it to me.

577
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:39,001
Sir, I always dreamt
of buying a scooter.

578
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:42,501
Sir, the helmet..

579
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:46,960
Okay, sir. Thank you.

580
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:54,126
Please start.

581
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:58,376
Guess it's out of fuel.

582
00:57:15,043 --> 00:57:16,126
You keep it.

583
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:12,835
I didn't hear your scooter.

584
00:58:14,793 --> 00:58:16,001
It's in the garage.

585
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:24,168
Leave it on. I haven't finished yet.

586
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,876
I'll sleep once I'm done reading this.

587
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:31,251
Don't stay up too late.

588
00:59:19,668 --> 00:59:21,251
Merry Christmas, John.

589
00:59:23,418 --> 00:59:27,876
She turned 16, an hour ago.

590
00:59:29,168 --> 00:59:30,626
She was born on this day..

591
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,251
Christmas eve.

592
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:37,626
That's why we named her Angela.

593
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:39,751
Angel..Angela.

594
00:59:40,001 --> 00:59:42,293
I will pray for her..
and for you too.

595
00:59:42,293 --> 00:59:43,460
Let God grant you peace.

596
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:46,335
I neither want peace
nor your prayers.

597
00:59:50,126 --> 00:59:52,085
What's this?
- Some names.

598
00:59:53,876 --> 00:59:55,626
If you've ever heard
about anyone from the list..

599
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:58,626
...maybe with some criminal record.

600
01:00:00,293 --> 01:00:04,501
The Land Measurement Office knew that
I was buying a property for Peter.

601
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:07,126
And I have money.

602
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:12,001
The police never paid
attention to this detail.

603
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,751
Soon after this incident..

604
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:17,251
...few people quit their job.

605
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:20,085
This is a list of those people.

606
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:27,210
If you've ever heard about them,
or have any records ..

607
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:31,585
This isn't the time
to talk about all this.

608
01:00:32,168 --> 01:00:35,876
Take a look, maybe..
- Father.

609
01:00:37,418 --> 01:00:39,501
My daughter made
this card for you.

610
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:46,501
My God!

611
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:49,126
You made this?

612
01:00:49,418 --> 01:00:51,001
It's really beautiful.

613
01:00:51,293 --> 01:00:53,460
I'll always keep it with me.

614
01:01:02,543 --> 01:01:03,626
<i>Bhaskar.</i>

615
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:08,835
Hello.

616
01:01:09,293 --> 01:01:11,501
You wanted proof of life, didn't you?

617
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,376
A garbage truck will pass by your
house in less than three minutes.

618
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:27,501
Hey stop! Stop!

619
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:28,126
It's the same kidnapper.

620
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:31,501
He's back.

621
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,376
You were right.

622
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:41,460
So this is exactly how..

623
01:02:41,668 --> 01:02:44,126
...he had sent you evidence
that the child is alive.

624
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:45,501
Then?

625
01:03:00,793 --> 01:03:03,126
He has asked you to keep
the bag near the pillar.

626
01:03:05,126 --> 01:03:08,126
So keep it there and don't wait.

627
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:11,168
The police will have covered
the entire railway station by then.

628
01:03:11,168 --> 01:03:12,376
So don't worry about it.

629
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:16,210
I am scared.

630
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:23,251
He kept saying..don't
involve the police.

631
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:25,501
I hope there won't be a problem.

632
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,251
No, no, there won't be any problem.

633
01:03:27,418 --> 01:03:29,876
We'll arrest him and save Angela.

634
01:03:30,626 --> 01:03:31,376
So don't worry.

635
01:03:31,543 --> 01:03:32,710
Bhaskar, listen..

636
01:03:42,293 --> 01:03:44,460
You should talk to Peter once.

637
01:03:45,376 --> 01:03:46,835
Angela is his daughter.

638
01:03:47,376 --> 01:03:49,210
He has all the right to know.

639
01:03:51,543 --> 01:03:54,376
I'll tell him once
Angela is back home safely.

640
01:03:55,668 --> 01:03:57,710
Or else he'll get
scared and will panic.

641
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:01,085
John.

642
01:04:03,668 --> 01:04:04,960
I must go now.

643
01:04:08,543 --> 01:04:09,835
All units are ready?

644
01:05:14,918 --> 01:05:16,751
Hey, shut the station.

645
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,585
Nobody should get out.

646
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,085
It was all in vain.

647
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:26,126
We couldn't catch him.

648
01:05:29,043 --> 01:05:30,460
If it's the same guy..

649
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,876
...do you think he'll
plan something similar?

650
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:35,376
I can bet on it.

651
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:39,126
You may have stopped
wearing the uniform, but..

652
01:05:39,418 --> 01:05:41,376
...you still sound like a policeman.

653
01:05:44,793 --> 01:05:47,585
Whom are you trying to deceive ?
Your God ..or your own self..

654
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:49,126
Father Martin...?

655
01:05:56,418 --> 01:05:57,251
Hello.

656
01:05:57,543 --> 01:05:59,751
Did you get proof of life?
- Yes.

657
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:02,293
But I want to talk to Ronnie.

658
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:03,710
You will get your chance.

659
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,876
But right now,
collect your parcel from the entrance.

660
01:06:06,293 --> 01:06:07,376
Parcel?

661
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,126
What happened after
the station incident?

662
01:06:53,168 --> 01:06:54,835
I want the file immediately.
- Yes, sir.

663
01:06:55,293 --> 01:06:56,126
Martin!

664
01:07:00,793 --> 01:07:01,960
Have you lost your mind?

665
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,876
You lost 20 lakhs of police money.

666
01:07:06,043 --> 01:07:09,668
Sorry sir, but we have the
serial numbers of the notes.

667
01:07:09,668 --> 01:07:14,376
Means what? Until he doesn't spend
the money we cannot trace him..

668
01:07:14,376 --> 01:07:16,001
Till then we'll be sitting idle.

669
01:07:16,543 --> 01:07:18,335
With our hands in our pockets.

670
01:07:20,293 --> 01:07:23,668
And now you want the kidnapper to
do your job for you..

671
01:07:23,668 --> 01:07:26,251
...he has made a fool
out of all of you.

672
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:27,626
Shame on you.

673
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,418
Extremely sorry, sir, but we..

674
01:07:30,418 --> 01:07:31,751
I am taking over this case!

675
01:07:32,043 --> 01:07:34,210
Put the entire unit
to trace the money back.

676
01:07:34,543 --> 01:07:37,251
Raise an alert in the city..sniff
the money out... like dogs.

677
01:07:39,543 --> 01:07:41,876
You have made us all
look like a piece of shit.

678
01:07:42,168 --> 01:07:45,501
Extremely sorry, sir, but we
should have a unit at John's home.

679
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:46,751
What if the kidnapper...

680
01:07:46,918 --> 01:07:49,251
Have you lost your mind, Martin?

681
01:07:50,168 --> 01:07:52,251
The kidnapper has the money now.

682
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,876
Will he call back to say thank you?

683
01:07:56,168 --> 01:07:57,210
Idiot!

684
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:04,001
Martin, just do as
you're told. Got it?

685
01:08:23,168 --> 01:08:24,543
What are you guys doing here?

686
01:08:24,543 --> 01:08:25,251
Who is at John's home?

687
01:08:25,418 --> 01:08:26,626
Chief on the wireless
asked us to come back..

688
01:08:26,793 --> 01:08:28,585
You should have waited for my order.

689
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:29,751
Who's there now?

690
01:08:30,043 --> 01:08:31,376
There's no one,
we just left the recorder at his home.

691
01:08:31,543 --> 01:08:32,626
Left the recorder"

692
01:08:33,293 --> 01:08:34,251
What happened, sir?

693
01:08:34,501 --> 01:08:37,168
There's a difference between a
recorder and an order, idiots.

694
01:08:37,168 --> 01:08:38,751
What can the recorder do?

695
01:08:39,418 --> 01:08:40,626
What happened?

696
01:08:55,126 --> 01:08:55,751
Hello.

697
01:08:55,918 --> 01:08:57,626
You shouldn't have betrayed me.

698
01:08:57,626 --> 01:09:00,251
You shouldn't have called the police.
- I'm sorry!

699
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:02,501
Now I'll do exactly as you say.

700
01:09:02,793 --> 01:09:07,418
Please..don't hurt Angela.

701
01:09:07,418 --> 01:09:10,001
Fine, I'll give you another chance.

702
01:09:13,043 --> 01:09:15,626
Grandpa.. Grandpa...
- Angela... Angela...

703
01:09:15,793 --> 01:09:17,126
I'm sorry Grandpa.

704
01:09:17,543 --> 01:09:19,168
It was my fault.

705
01:09:19,168 --> 01:09:21,585
I should have listened to you.

706
01:09:21,793 --> 01:09:25,501
I shouldn't have taken the shortcut.

707
01:09:25,876 --> 01:09:29,835
No, Angela.
You didn't make any mistake.

708
01:09:30,126 --> 01:09:32,251
You will be fine..you'll be fine.

709
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,501
Grandpa! Grandpa!

710
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:37,043
Are you assured now?

711
01:09:37,043 --> 01:09:40,085
I will tell you where
to bring the money.

712
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:56,626
John, this is Peter's money.

713
01:09:57,043 --> 01:09:58,335
We cannot take it.

714
01:09:58,918 --> 01:10:00,626
This was meant for
buying that property for him.

715
01:10:00,626 --> 01:10:06,501
Peter would've done the
same thing if he was in my place.

716
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:14,335
There's a 12 hour time difference
between here and there.

717
01:10:15,543 --> 01:10:16,751
He must be sleeping now.

718
01:10:17,876 --> 01:10:20,876
It will take time to
explain everything to him, Nancy.

719
01:10:21,043 --> 01:10:25,626
And I don't have time.

720
01:10:26,543 --> 01:10:30,251
We should've told him when
this happened in the first place.

721
01:10:30,418 --> 01:10:32,751
It's not right to
keep him in the dark.

722
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:34,085
It's not right, John.

723
01:10:34,668 --> 01:10:36,460
At least talk to Martin once.

724
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:39,460
Do you see any policeman here?

725
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,626
Do you?

726
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:45,710
This is their fault.

727
01:10:46,043 --> 01:10:47,751
And now they have left us alone.

728
01:10:48,418 --> 01:10:50,501
We must do this on our own, Nancy.

729
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:51,710
On our own.

730
01:10:59,168 --> 01:11:00,001
John.

731
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:03,210
Where's John?
- Martin, the kidnapper called again.

732
01:11:04,543 --> 01:11:06,085
John went alone.

733
01:11:10,501 --> 01:11:11,251
"Grandpa!"

734
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:12,876
"Are you convinced now?"

735
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:15,751
"I will tell you where
to bring the money."

736
01:11:16,293 --> 01:11:18,251
As you drive out of the city..

737
01:11:18,418 --> 01:11:22,376
...you'll come across a
dirt track on your right.

738
01:11:23,543 --> 01:11:26,376
Drive down that path,
through the jungle.

739
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:28,585
Then you will find a signboard..

740
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:34,251
...that reads, Kalikapur 5 kms.

741
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:36,210
Just wait there.

742
01:11:39,043 --> 01:11:40,543
Hello. Yes, Martin speaking.

743
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,918
I've some new information.

744
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:44,001
Send all teams to Kalikapur.

745
01:11:44,001 --> 01:11:48,251
Sir.. we have tracked the marked
notes in a mobile shop at New Market.

746
01:11:48,418 --> 01:11:50,335
The kidnapper is misleading you.

747
01:11:50,918 --> 01:11:52,876
The exchange is happening
near Kalikapur, got it?

748
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:57,501
Sir, you please speak to our Chief.
He is leading the units.

749
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:01,085
Wear the garbage bag over your head.

750
01:13:03,293 --> 01:13:04,501
After that?

751
01:13:12,293 --> 01:13:13,376
I think we have reached.

752
01:13:18,626 --> 01:13:20,626
We will board the train two
stations ahead of the main station..

753
01:13:20,626 --> 01:13:22,751
This time we will have
to catch him inside the train.

754
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:26,960
Last time we didn't focus
on the train.

755
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:28,876
This time we know.

756
01:13:29,543 --> 01:13:30,960
So that has to be covered.

757
01:13:31,668 --> 01:13:33,251
I am coming with you.

758
01:13:36,001 --> 01:13:37,626
Then who will go with the ransom bag?

759
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:40,001
The real mother has
to go and deliver the bag.

760
01:13:40,418 --> 01:13:43,376
He may not recognize her voice,
but maybe he knows her face.

761
01:13:44,293 --> 01:13:45,501
We can't take that risk.

762
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:21,751
He is in that compartment.
Let's go there.

763
01:14:34,418 --> 01:14:36,418
Mrs. Neeta, don't be scared.

764
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:38,210
We have placed a
tracker inside the bag.

765
01:14:38,418 --> 01:14:40,251
Leave the bag near the pillar.

766
01:14:41,793 --> 01:14:43,251
Tracker is on mark Sir.

767
01:14:43,418 --> 01:14:45,126
The train is reaching
on platform number 1.

768
01:14:48,293 --> 01:14:49,251
All teams alert.

769
01:14:49,668 --> 01:14:51,626
The train is approaching
platform no. 1.

770
01:14:52,168 --> 01:14:54,751
Platform team, be alert..
and take your positions?

771
01:14:56,418 --> 01:14:57,876
Phone booth unit is ready.

772
01:15:19,668 --> 01:15:21,126
Platform is full of army cadets.

773
01:15:21,293 --> 01:15:22,960
There are army cadets everywhere.

774
01:15:23,876 --> 01:15:25,251
The bag isn't visible!

775
01:15:29,543 --> 01:15:31,126
The bag's moving! The bag's moving!

776
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,001
It's heading towards platform no.2.

777
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,876
Keep watching. Keep watching.
- Okay, sir.

778
01:15:38,418 --> 01:15:39,876
They can't find the bag.

779
01:15:40,043 --> 01:15:41,168
I should go to my team.

780
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:42,501
I'll look on the other side,
I missed that last time.

781
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:43,210
Yes.

782
01:15:52,293 --> 01:15:53,251
Move.

783
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:03,251
The bag's heading
towards platform no. 3.

784
01:16:12,376 --> 01:16:14,251
The tracker is static.

785
01:16:19,793 --> 01:16:21,168
Madam, signal is lost.

786
01:16:21,168 --> 01:16:22,626
What? - Signal is lost, madam.

787
01:16:23,043 --> 01:16:24,001
Martin.

788
01:16:26,543 --> 01:16:27,626
He's here.

789
01:16:58,668 --> 01:16:59,751
Leave me.

790
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:34,626
I have already told you..

791
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,793
He called me and told me to do this.

792
01:17:40,501 --> 01:17:42,585
Why don't you believe me?

793
01:17:44,418 --> 01:17:47,668
Actually, I haven't slept
properly since the last few days.

794
01:17:50,668 --> 01:17:53,376
So it's hard to put everything
together in my head.

795
01:17:54,168 --> 01:17:56,335
Will you repeat that again, please?

796
01:17:57,668 --> 01:17:59,293
You're making me
repeat again and again“

797
01:17:59,293 --> 01:18:02,918
...so that I make a
mistake and you nail me.

798
01:18:04,376 --> 01:18:07,418
But that won't happen, ma'am..
because I am telling the truth.

799
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:10,668
It won't change no matter
how many times I say it.

800
01:18:14,043 --> 01:18:16,501
You seem quite familiar
with interrogation methods.

801
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,085
How?

802
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:21,585
By the way, you don't need to worry.

803
01:18:21,793 --> 01:18:23,251
This time I will write it down.

804
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:26,251
Bablu, get me a pen and a paper.

805
01:18:30,918 --> 01:18:32,668
So you received a call from him?

806
01:18:32,668 --> 01:18:33,293
Yes.

807
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:36,376
Then?

808
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:39,001
Yeah, okay.

809
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,960
Yes, I am here.

810
01:18:47,668 --> 01:18:49,043
I can see the road.

811
01:18:55,293 --> 01:18:57,751
Grandpa help!
Grandpa, where are you?

812
01:18:58,126 --> 01:18:58,710
Ronnie?

813
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,501
Grandpa, where are you?
Grandpa help!

814
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,126
Grandpa, where are you?
Grandpa help!

815
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:13,168
Ronnie! Ronnie!

816
01:19:31,543 --> 01:19:33,668
<i>Grandpa hen)'-!</i>

817
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:36,960
Grandpa, where are you?
Grandpa help!

818
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,626
Ronnie
- When will you come, grandpa?

819
01:19:38,626 --> 01:19:42,668
Grandpa, come fast.
Grandpa help!

820
01:19:42,668 --> 01:19:46,126
Grandpa help! Please.

821
01:19:46,126 --> 01:19:48,626
When will you come, grandpa?

822
01:19:48,626 --> 01:19:52,210
Grandpa help! Please!

823
01:20:02,126 --> 01:20:05,001
Hey stop!
Where is Ronnie?

824
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:08,251
Open the door.

825
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:12,626
I kept yelling for help,
but no one came.

826
01:20:12,626 --> 01:20:15,085
I don't know how long
I was locked up in there.

827
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,710
There was no way to escape.

828
01:20:19,751 --> 01:20:23,418
I kept looking around
in the dark for a while.

829
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:25,960
And then sat down.

830
01:21:05,626 --> 01:21:07,460
The paper had an information for me..

831
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,210
It read, wear the uniform..

832
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:11,126
...and go to the place,
programmed in the GPS in 30 minutes

833
01:21:11,126 --> 01:21:13,418
Even a delay of one minute,
will cost the child's life.

834
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,335
Am I allowed to smoke in here?

835
01:21:24,168 --> 01:21:25,126
No.

836
01:21:25,585 --> 01:21:27,543
But there's no one to complain either.

837
01:21:51,376 --> 01:21:52,501
Thank you.

838
01:21:56,543 --> 01:21:58,126
Please believe me.

839
01:21:58,835 --> 01:22:00,460
He still has Ronnie with him.

840
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:04,460
You're wasting your time.
You can still save Ronnie.

841
01:22:05,168 --> 01:22:06,460
Where's your car?

842
01:22:07,876 --> 01:22:09,335
Don't know..

843
01:22:09,335 --> 01:22:10,918
I left it outside the railway station.

844
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:12,918
And your mobile?

845
01:22:13,335 --> 01:22:17,960
When I was crossing the
Hooghly bridge, he called again.

846
01:22:19,376 --> 01:22:21,793
He told me to throw away my phone.

847
01:22:22,876 --> 01:22:25,710
I asked him where will I find Ronnie?

848
01:22:26,043 --> 01:22:28,876
And he said there's a
bag in the boot of the car..

849
01:22:29,626 --> 01:22:33,293
...which I must exchange
at the railway platform.

850
01:22:33,918 --> 01:22:35,751
Later I must run
to the end of the station..

851
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:38,043
...and throw it across the wall
on the other side.

852
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:41,251
I was about to throw the bag,
when you caught me.

853
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:46,418
He also said that..if
I succeed in throwing the bag..

854
01:22:47,043 --> 01:22:49,585
...l will find Ronnie on
the other side of the wall.

855
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,293
And you believed him.

856
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:57,835
Did I have a choice?

857
01:23:01,835 --> 01:23:03,335
You can cry later.

858
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:07,210
First finish your cigarette.

859
01:23:07,626 --> 01:23:09,126
My officers will be here soon..

860
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,585
...and they are not as generous as me.

861
01:23:20,043 --> 01:23:21,460
Seems like the same brand.

862
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:27,126
You should be happy, Father Martin.

863
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,043
We finally found your kidnapper.

864
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:30,835
I am happy.

865
01:23:30,835 --> 01:23:33,418
lam quite happy
the way you handled it.

866
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,043
But I feel something's wrong.

867
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:51,876
<i>The shining sun of joy..</i>

868
01:23:51,876 --> 01:23:55,501
<i>The radiant dome of bliss..</i>

869
01:23:55,501 --> 01:24:00,710
<i>It submerged the envious
glances..total eclipse!</i>

870
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:06,335
<i>Effective was his ploy..</i>

871
01:24:06,335 --> 01:24:09,876
<i>...in ill-fated times“.</i>

872
01:24:09,876 --> 01:24:14,043
<i>...it spread like venom..
total eclipse!</i>

873
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:24,418
<i>The shining sun of joy..</i>

874
01:24:24,418 --> 01:24:28,001
<i>The radiant dome of bliss..</i>

875
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:32,543
<i>It submerged the envious
glances..total eclipse!</i>

876
01:24:35,168 --> 01:24:38,793
<i>A woe unexpected..</i>

877
01:24:38,793 --> 01:24:42,418
<i>Like termite“.</i>

878
01:24:42,418 --> 01:24:47,376
<i>It gnawed away,
bit by bit..total eclipse!</i>

879
01:24:50,918 --> 01:24:54,626
<i>The vision is foggy"</i>

880
01:24:54,626 --> 01:24:57,835
<i>All the doors are shut..</i>

881
01:24:57,835 --> 01:25:02,793
<i>Every assurance sounds false...</i>

882
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,960
<i>The voice quivers...</i>

883
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,126
<i>A secret behind the curtain..</i>

884
01:25:12,126 --> 01:25:17,710
<i>Why isn't it being revealed?</i>

885
01:25:19,168 --> 01:25:21,251
Excuse me. Mister.

886
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:26,335
Manager? Manager?
- Yes, that's me. Tell me.

887
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:29,585
I am a..journalist.

888
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:33,585
I am writing an article..

889
01:25:34,043 --> 01:25:36,626
...on the dying mill industry..

890
01:25:36,626 --> 01:25:39,585
...and the abandoned
ones that are still functioning.

891
01:25:40,126 --> 01:25:44,751
The mill owner, Mr. Hari Prakash.

892
01:25:44,751 --> 01:25:46,543
I want to talk to him.
Where is he?

893
01:25:46,793 --> 01:25:48,710
He hasn't arrived yet.
- Huh?

894
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:51,793
He hasn't arrived yet.
- I see.

895
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:55,626
Where's his office?
- First floor.

896
01:25:55,626 --> 01:25:57,626
Huh?
- First floor.

897
01:25:57,626 --> 01:25:59,460
Okay, where is first floor?

898
01:26:26,251 --> 01:26:28,460
Father Martin, we've a warrant.

899
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,293
We're going to search Manoher's house.

900
01:26:33,001 --> 01:26:33,876
Will you come along?

901
01:26:34,626 --> 01:26:35,460
I don't know.

902
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:46,835
Did you ever feel that
your father could do..

903
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,626
He loved Ronnie a lot.

904
01:26:49,293 --> 01:26:50,876
I just can't believe this.

905
01:26:51,751 --> 01:26:53,335
Why will he do such a thing?

906
01:26:53,668 --> 01:26:57,543
Honestly, I've seen
stranger cases than this in my career.

907
01:26:58,001 --> 01:27:00,751
But are you sure he's the one?

908
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,001
Because I just don't get it.

909
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:08,126
Although..since I got here,
everyone pointed out..

910
01:27:08,126 --> 01:27:11,168
...that he's been missing
from the moment you came here.

911
01:27:14,293 --> 01:27:14,918
Just a minute.

912
01:27:20,751 --> 01:27:22,251
What is your opinion about him?

913
01:27:23,126 --> 01:27:25,668
Honestly, I don't know him too well.

914
01:27:26,418 --> 01:27:29,293
All I know is that he worked
somewhere in the Gulf.

915
01:27:29,876 --> 01:27:31,793
He didn't attend
our wedding either.

916
01:27:32,418 --> 01:27:35,501
But yes, he did come
when Neeta was pregnant.

917
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,501
By then I was already
posted in the North-east..

918
01:27:38,876 --> 01:27:40,251
...and I would only
come home during holidays.

919
01:27:40,793 --> 01:27:42,501
There was not much interaction.

920
01:27:43,043 --> 01:27:46,960
When Neeta told me that
he'll stay with us.

921
01:27:47,418 --> 01:27:48,751
I thought it's okay.

922
01:27:48,751 --> 01:27:49,710
Because I hardly stay here.

923
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:51,501
If someone stays with
Neeta in my absence..

924
01:27:51,501 --> 01:27:52,501
...it will be good for her.

925
01:27:55,293 --> 01:27:59,460
There's one thing though, we didn't
get along on certain issues.

926
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,001
Is this your house?

927
01:28:02,501 --> 01:28:04,626
Yeah, this is a family house.

928
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:07,501
So..where did Neeta and
Manohar live before your wedding?

929
01:28:08,793 --> 01:28:10,501
They had a small house in Barrackpur.

930
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:29,585
Did you check here?

931
01:28:35,251 --> 01:28:37,168
Sarita. - Yeah.

932
01:28:39,918 --> 01:28:40,751
Look.

933
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:44,835
Same wall. Same marks.

934
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:49,751
So this is where
the picture was taken?

935
01:28:56,668 --> 01:28:59,626
You mean to say that someone
from the Land Measurement Division..

936
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:00,751
...was involved in the kidnapping.

937
01:29:01,876 --> 01:29:05,960
Because the people
in your office knew..

938
01:29:06,543 --> 01:29:11,210
...that I am buying a land,
and the amount of money I had.

939
01:29:13,418 --> 01:29:20,668
The police focused on every aspect,
but left this one out.

940
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:27,043
Didn't you ever suspect him?

941
01:29:28,085 --> 01:29:28,960
Kumar?

942
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:33,460
He was thrown out for fradulence
and mishandling of money.

943
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:38,751
Kumar?

944
01:29:39,585 --> 01:29:43,001
Sir, Manohar also worked
in a government office.

945
01:29:43,335 --> 01:29:44,710
Back then he had a steady income.
- Yes.

946
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,501
Then suddenly one day he quit.

947
01:29:47,418 --> 01:29:49,626
So he never got pension
or retirement benefits.

948
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,626
Before his wife's death, she..

949
01:29:52,626 --> 01:29:55,210
...transferred her village property
in the name of her daughter.

950
01:29:55,210 --> 01:29:56,085
Oh, I see.

951
01:29:56,085 --> 01:29:58,960
The same property,
which his son-in-law..

952
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,918
...Neeta's husband wanted to sell.

953
01:30:01,876 --> 01:30:04,251
Because he couldn't
maintain the place.

954
01:30:04,793 --> 01:30:07,876
If he had sold the house, then Manohar
would've been left with nothing.

955
01:30:07,876 --> 01:30:10,001
He would've been dependent
on his son-in-law.

956
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:12,085
And they don't get along, Sir.

957
01:30:13,335 --> 01:30:17,001
So according to me, this kidnapping
was Manohar's retirement plan?

958
01:30:18,168 --> 01:30:19,626
Then, what about the media?

959
01:30:20,293 --> 01:30:25,793
Sir, we have matched his DNA with the
cigarette butt found outside the PCO.

960
01:30:27,126 --> 01:30:28,835
We already have a prime suspect.

961
01:30:28,835 --> 01:30:31,585
But I suggest that we
shouldn't go to the media..

962
01:30:31,835 --> 01:30:33,585
...Till we find Ronnie.

963
01:30:33,585 --> 01:30:35,335
We're looking for Manohar's car.

964
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,126
Okay Sarita,
find it as soon as you can.

965
01:30:37,126 --> 01:30:40,710
Because I don't think I
can hold back the media for long.

966
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:42,043
Understand? - Yes, sir.

967
01:30:44,793 --> 01:30:46,293
So what's the Commissioner saying?

968
01:30:46,668 --> 01:30:48,668
He's asked me to find
Ronnie as soon as possible.

969
01:30:49,126 --> 01:30:52,085
But he's also in a hurry to inform
the press about Manohar's arrest.

970
01:30:52,376 --> 01:30:53,168
Oh...

971
01:30:58,710 --> 01:30:59,293
What?

972
01:31:01,085 --> 01:31:02,001
What's bothering you?

973
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:05,626
You've seen all the evidence.
Why don't you accept it?

974
01:31:12,335 --> 01:31:13,751
You answered his ransom call.

975
01:31:15,751 --> 01:31:17,335
Wouldn't he have
recognized your voice?

976
01:31:18,001 --> 01:31:20,418
But he kept
talking to you as Neeta.

977
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:21,418
Why?

978
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:24,168
Maybe I sound like
Neeta over the phone?

979
01:31:25,043 --> 01:31:26,960
Or maybe the line wasn't clear?

980
01:31:27,335 --> 01:31:29,460
Bad connection..every time?

981
01:31:30,543 --> 01:31:32,001
That's your argument.

982
01:31:50,293 --> 01:31:51,168
Where is Ronnie?

983
01:31:53,251 --> 01:31:57,418
I told you I don't know.
I didn't kidnap him?

984
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,460
You know your daughter
has a heart problem. Right.

985
01:32:05,251 --> 01:32:06,751
Do you want to give her more stress?

986
01:32:08,376 --> 01:32:10,251
She must be suffering every moment.

987
01:32:11,751 --> 01:32:13,960
The longer her son
stays away from her..

988
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,001
...the more she will suffer.

989
01:32:17,543 --> 01:32:18,835
What kind of a father are you?

990
01:32:19,043 --> 01:32:20,376
Your own daughter
is suffering and you..

991
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:23,751
Where is Ronnie?

992
01:32:25,668 --> 01:32:29,585
I told you, I didn't kidnap him.

993
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:31,335
Why will l..

994
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:44,626
Kumar.

995
01:34:29,751 --> 01:34:33,085
Munna is a drug-lord of this area.

996
01:34:36,376 --> 01:34:38,918
I owe him a lot of money.

997
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:42,668
They are after me.

998
01:34:44,418 --> 01:34:46,626
During the time-period
you're inquiring about..

999
01:34:48,335 --> 01:34:53,043
...I was in prison for drunk-driving.

1000
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,460
You can confirm with the police.

1001
01:34:58,418 --> 01:34:59,460
And that black van?

1002
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:01,210
Belongs to me.

1003
01:35:02,793 --> 01:35:04,585
I used to hire it out.

1004
01:35:05,751 --> 01:35:07,210
To clients who had to shift furniture,
cupboards etc.. while shifting houses.

1005
01:35:08,043 --> 01:35:09,585
Like movers and packers you know..

1006
01:35:10,543 --> 01:35:11,585
Mostly to them.

1007
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,960
There are pictures of
army personnel in your home.

1008
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:36,751
Where did that come from?

1009
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:41,501
Someone or the other from my
family has always been in the army.

1010
01:35:43,376 --> 01:35:44,918
There are many institutions..

1011
01:35:44,918 --> 01:35:48,710
...who hires ex-army
men for security services.

1012
01:35:51,751 --> 01:35:54,960
Was there anyone else
in the Land Measurement Office..

1013
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,210
...who was an ex-army man?

1014
01:36:04,376 --> 01:36:05,960
Anyone from this list?

1015
01:36:10,668 --> 01:36:12,918
Did you get it?

1016
01:36:13,335 --> 01:36:15,293
No water, no fan, nothing for him..
- Sarita, I want to speak to you.

1017
01:36:15,293 --> 01:36:16,335
And..

1018
01:36:16,335 --> 01:36:17,335
Sarita.. - Just a minute.

1019
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:19,085
You stay there. - Yes.

1020
01:36:19,293 --> 01:36:20,585
I want to talk to you.

1021
01:36:21,835 --> 01:36:23,418
Sarita. - Yes.

1022
01:36:23,751 --> 01:36:25,001
We haven't found Ronnie yet..

1023
01:36:25,543 --> 01:36:27,001
We're making a mistake.

1024
01:36:28,626 --> 01:36:29,543
What mistake?

1025
01:36:29,876 --> 01:36:31,001
It's an open and shut case.

1026
01:36:31,543 --> 01:36:33,043
After looking at the wall in his house..

1027
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:34,251
...there is no room for any doubt.

1028
01:36:34,876 --> 01:36:36,501
He's just pretending, we'll break him.

1029
01:36:36,501 --> 01:36:37,460
The yellow wall?

1030
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,418
What is so unique about it?

1031
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:41,960
You can paint any wall,
take a picture.. that's it.

1032
01:36:43,043 --> 01:36:45,543
See, even if we believe
that it is the same house..

1033
01:36:45,543 --> 01:36:48,585
...but Manohar is claming that he
was locked up in some other place.

1034
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,460
The real kidnapper could
have taken the child there..

1035
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:52,251
...and clicked his picture.

1036
01:36:53,251 --> 01:36:54,918
If Manohar was locked up..

1037
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:57,918
...then, how can he make the ransom call?

1038
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,501
Only if Manohar is speaking the truth?

1039
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:01,835
What if he's telling the truth?

1040
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:06,835
See, the kidnapper called from a PCO.

1041
01:37:06,835 --> 01:37:08,626
Then he wiped his own fingerprints.

1042
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:10,335
But he left behind the cigarette butt.

1043
01:37:10,668 --> 01:37:12,251
So under the circumstances
he did two things.

1044
01:37:12,251 --> 01:37:13,918
One, he showed his clever side..
and the other, very foolish.

1045
01:37:13,918 --> 01:37:15,126
Isn't that strange?

1046
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,793
Now, we must think
from a different angle.

1047
01:37:18,085 --> 01:37:19,793
If he was wearing a pair of gloves..

1048
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:23,085
...everything would
have changed easily.

1049
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:25,501
Then he would've
never wiped the phone.

1050
01:37:29,793 --> 01:37:31,126
In that situation, you would've found..

1051
01:37:31,126 --> 01:37:32,876
...many fingerprints on the phone..

1052
01:37:32,876 --> 01:37:35,960
...and you would've wasted precious
time in finding a single match.

1053
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:37,793
And yet you wouldn't
have found your suspect.

1054
01:37:39,126 --> 01:37:42,043
When we caught him, he was trying to..

1055
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,126
...throw the bag of money
on the other side of the wall.

1056
01:37:44,668 --> 01:37:45,501
Why?

1057
01:37:47,793 --> 01:37:49,960
After taking such
a big risk to get this money..

1058
01:37:50,626 --> 01:37:53,418
...why would he would throw the bag
on the other side? He would only do it if..

1059
01:37:53,418 --> 01:37:56,043
...he had a partner on the other side..
or if someone had threatened him to do it.

1060
01:37:59,043 --> 01:38:01,751
Your theory about
the partner might be right.

1061
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:07,710
But his story about locking him
up and threatening him..is bullshit.

1062
01:38:17,251 --> 01:38:18,710
What are you thinking?

1063
01:38:21,085 --> 01:38:24,418
He repeated his 8 years old plan again.

1064
01:38:26,543 --> 01:38:28,960
And this time..to perfection.

1065
01:41:26,085 --> 01:41:28,376
I need you to check a CD.
- Come on.

1066
01:41:34,918 --> 01:41:37,751
Help Grandpa!!
Save me!! Where are you?

1067
01:41:37,751 --> 01:41:42,835
Help.. Save me Grandpa..
Where are you? Come and help me.

1068
01:41:42,835 --> 01:41:46,418
Save me.. Come fast Grandpa..

1069
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:50,835
Please Grandpa!! Help me!!

1070
01:41:54,293 --> 01:41:56,460
This means Manohar
was telling the truth.

1071
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:59,876
Who? - No, nothing.

1072
01:42:01,418 --> 01:42:02,751
Was that the only voice on the CD?

1073
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:07,001
That's the main audio. - Main Audio?

1074
01:42:07,418 --> 01:42:08,376
Is there something else?

1075
01:42:08,751 --> 01:42:12,210
Look..there's a soft voice here.

1076
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:18,293
Say "Help Grandpa.." Say "Help me.."

1077
01:42:18,293 --> 01:42:20,251
Grandpa help!! Help me..

1078
01:42:20,251 --> 01:42:22,710
Be loud.. Say 'Help Grandpa.."..

1079
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:25,668
Help Grandpa..Help me!!

1080
01:42:32,001 --> 01:42:35,501
Be loud..
Say 'Help Grandpa..".. Be loud..

1081
01:42:36,668 --> 01:42:39,126
Help Grandpa..Help me!!

1082
01:42:41,043 --> 01:42:44,043
Help Grandpa..Help me!!

1083
01:42:58,376 --> 01:43:02,626
So this is that kidnapper who hasn't
let me sleep for all these years.

1084
01:44:40,585 --> 01:44:43,210
I haven't done anything.

1085
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:45,085
I am being framed. - Go inside.

1086
01:44:45,085 --> 01:44:46,460
Believe me.

1087
01:44:47,876 --> 01:44:48,835
Move.

1088
01:45:14,043 --> 01:45:15,210
You're making a big mistake.

1089
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:16,210
He didn't commit this crime.

1090
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:17,501
He was locked in the warehouse.

1091
01:45:17,835 --> 01:45:18,918
I gave you that CD.

1092
01:45:19,251 --> 01:45:20,126
What do you mean?

1093
01:45:20,501 --> 01:45:22,168
Who said this to you? Manohar?

1094
01:45:22,626 --> 01:45:24,251
He wants this to happen.

1095
01:45:25,001 --> 01:45:27,668
And the other voice on the
CD could be Manohar's as well.

1096
01:45:27,668 --> 01:45:29,001
You're making a mistake.

1097
01:45:29,001 --> 01:45:30,793
He did it. - So where's Ronnie?

1098
01:45:31,168 --> 01:45:32,668
You looked everywhere.

1099
01:45:32,668 --> 01:45:34,460
He kidnapped the child,
and was apprehended as well..

1100
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:36,835
...yet we have no clue,
this doesn't make any sense?

1101
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:40,835
I think he's killed
the child and hid the body.

1102
01:45:42,043 --> 01:45:42,751
What?

1103
01:45:45,501 --> 01:45:46,668
What do you mean?

1104
01:45:46,918 --> 01:45:48,835
If the body isn't found..

1105
01:45:48,835 --> 01:45:51,210
...he knows he cannot
be charged with kidnapping.

1106
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:52,626
And if the body's found..

1107
01:45:52,626 --> 01:45:55,001
...then he'll be charged
with kidnapping and murder.

1108
01:45:55,001 --> 01:45:56,376
That's why he isn't confessing.

1109
01:45:56,835 --> 01:45:57,751
You're making a mistake.

1110
01:45:59,751 --> 01:46:01,460
The kidnapper didn't kill Angela.

1111
01:46:02,126 --> 01:46:03,001
Her death..

1112
01:46:05,168 --> 01:46:06,960
Her death..was an accident.

1113
01:46:18,668 --> 01:46:20,876
This isn't Angela's
case..nor is it yours.

1114
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:24,710
Maybe Angela's kidnapper
was someone else.

1115
01:46:25,501 --> 01:46:26,501
Maybe I was wrong.

1116
01:46:28,168 --> 01:46:31,251
He could've gathered these
details from the police files as well.

1117
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:34,918
Maybe he's trying to confuse us.

1118
01:46:35,585 --> 01:46:37,251
Don't try to mix both the cases.

1119
01:46:37,251 --> 01:46:39,168
You are not trying to understand.

1120
01:46:40,626 --> 01:46:43,126
Both the cases are the same..
they are linked.

1121
01:46:46,626 --> 01:46:48,876
Manohar isn't your kidnapper,
it's someone else.

1122
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:54,001
Take a look at the
voice analysis report..

1123
01:46:54,876 --> 01:46:57,001
...of the ransom call that
was made to Manohar's home.

1124
01:46:57,668 --> 01:46:58,876
Ronnie's ransom call.

1125
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:01,001
It's Manohar's voice.

1126
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:03,168
It's a perfect match.

1127
01:47:12,543 --> 01:47:15,376
A voice print is as full proof
an evidence, as a fingerprint.

1128
01:47:21,335 --> 01:47:25,460
And you know,
it's impossible to fake one's voice.

1129
01:47:29,335 --> 01:47:34,085
It's absolutely clear,
Manohar is the kidnapper.

1130
01:47:42,501 --> 01:47:44,043
"Why did you call the police?"

1131
01:47:44,418 --> 01:47:46,085
"I have your grandchild."

1132
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:47,960
"So stop wasting my time."

1133
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,418
"And arrange for two
million by tomorrow morning.."

1134
01:47:49,418 --> 01:47:50,751
"..if you want to see him alive."

1135
01:47:50,751 --> 01:47:52,001
"I will call again."

1136
01:47:55,835 --> 01:47:57,210
"Why did you call the police?"

1137
01:47:57,668 --> 01:47:59,585
"I have your grandchild."

1138
01:47:59,585 --> 01:48:01,376
"So stop wasting my time."

1139
01:48:01,376 --> 01:48:02,751
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1140
01:48:02,751 --> 01:48:04,376
"..if you want to see him alive."

1141
01:48:04,376 --> 01:48:05,418
"I will call again."

1142
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:08,710
"Why did you call the police?"

1143
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:10,543
"I have your grandchild."

1144
01:48:10,543 --> 01:48:12,335
"So stop wasting my time."

1145
01:48:12,335 --> 01:48:13,668
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1146
01:48:13,668 --> 01:48:14,835
"..if you want to see him alive."

1147
01:48:15,376 --> 01:48:16,960
"I will call again."

1148
01:48:25,585 --> 01:48:27,210
"Why did you call the police?"

1149
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:29,460
"I have your grandchild."

1150
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,293
"So stop wasting my time."

1151
01:48:31,293 --> 01:48:32,668
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1152
01:48:32,668 --> 01:48:33,835
"..if you want to see him alive."

1153
01:48:34,126 --> 01:48:35,460
"I will call again."

1154
01:48:41,168 --> 01:48:45,418
Angelina..8 year..

1155
01:48:47,126 --> 01:48:48,251
Angelina..

1156
01:48:48,626 --> 01:48:51,001
Angela..A N G E LA.

1157
01:48:54,835 --> 01:48:55,668
Found it!

1158
01:49:01,710 --> 01:49:04,585
It will take time to digitize
the old tape and listen to it.

1159
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:08,626
But what do you want to prove, Martin?

1160
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,918
This CD has the current ransom call.

1161
01:49:11,751 --> 01:49:14,876
Match the voice and see..
does it match with my case?

1162
01:49:14,876 --> 01:49:17,418
"Why did you call the police?"

1163
01:49:17,626 --> 01:49:19,001
"I have your grandchild."

1164
01:49:19,001 --> 01:49:20,710
Why is the voice so muffled?

1165
01:49:21,585 --> 01:49:22,876
Must be the recording.

1166
01:49:23,501 --> 01:49:24,251
No, no..

1167
01:49:28,918 --> 01:49:29,501
Hear this.

1168
01:49:29,501 --> 01:49:31,335
"Why did you call the police?"

1169
01:49:31,335 --> 01:49:33,043
"I have your grandchild."

1170
01:49:33,043 --> 01:49:34,793
"So stop wasting my time."

1171
01:49:34,793 --> 01:49:36,751
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1172
01:49:36,751 --> 01:49:38,085
"..if you want to see him alive."

1173
01:49:38,085 --> 01:49:39,668
The cycle bell is so clear.

1174
01:49:40,626 --> 01:49:43,001
How can the voice be so muffled..

1175
01:49:44,376 --> 01:49:46,418
...if the mouth-piece
is so close to him?

1176
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,585
Let me just enhance the audio clip..

1177
01:49:48,585 --> 01:49:50,168
"Hello, I am his mother speaking?"

1178
01:49:50,168 --> 01:49:52,001
Her voice sounds normal.

1179
01:49:52,001 --> 01:49:56,085
But why isn't both
the voices seem to balance?

1180
01:49:56,085 --> 01:49:57,710
"Hello? Hello?"

1181
01:49:57,710 --> 01:49:58,710
Let's check.

1182
01:49:59,585 --> 01:50:01,918
Even if the kidnapper used a filter..

1183
01:50:02,543 --> 01:50:04,918
...his voice quality can't be so bad.

1184
01:50:06,335 --> 01:50:07,918
"Why did you call the police?"

1185
01:50:08,418 --> 01:50:10,626
"I have your grandchild."

1186
01:50:20,126 --> 01:50:21,043
Martin.

1187
01:50:23,043 --> 01:50:24,210
Martin!

1188
01:50:25,168 --> 01:50:27,876
I have matched the
old and the new calls.

1189
01:50:27,876 --> 01:50:28,876
Find anything?

1190
01:50:28,876 --> 01:50:30,001
It's the same call.

1191
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:32,835
What?

1192
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:34,835
Look..

1193
01:50:35,001 --> 01:50:37,335
This is the current
kidnapper's waveform.

1194
01:50:38,543 --> 01:50:40,793
And this is the
kidnapper from your case.

1195
01:50:40,793 --> 01:50:42,210
"Why did you call the police?"

1196
01:50:42,376 --> 01:50:44,043
I'll play them simultaneously.

1197
01:50:45,085 --> 01:50:48,126
"I have your grandchild."

1198
01:50:48,126 --> 01:50:49,960
So it's the same kidnapper
in both cases.

1199
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:51,876
That I don't know whether
the kidnapper's same or not..

1200
01:50:52,793 --> 01:50:54,460
...but the ransom call is
definitely the same.

1201
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:55,793
Exact same.

1202
01:50:58,835 --> 01:51:04,293
How can a man speak in the
same way..choosing the same words..

1203
01:51:04,876 --> 01:51:10,626
...pause in the
same places, even after 8 years?

1204
01:51:14,085 --> 01:51:15,210
That's not possible.

1205
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:21,418
"Hello."

1206
01:51:22,001 --> 01:51:24,043
What's that sound?

1207
01:51:24,293 --> 01:51:25,918
"Why did you call the police?"

1208
01:51:25,918 --> 01:51:26,918
I guess it's a switch.

1209
01:51:26,918 --> 01:51:28,543
"Why did you call the police?"

1210
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:34,543
Someone's playing the same
ransom call over the phone.

1211
01:51:35,501 --> 01:51:39,585
Maybe it's the switch
of an old Walkman.

1212
01:51:41,418 --> 01:51:43,210
"I have your grandchild."

1213
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:44,876
"So stop wasting my time."

1214
01:51:44,876 --> 01:51:46,585
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1215
01:51:46,585 --> 01:51:47,876
"..if you want to see him alive."

1216
01:51:49,501 --> 01:51:51,460
There is a difference
in quality in both the calls.

1217
01:51:53,751 --> 01:51:55,293
Is it because the tape is too old?

1218
01:51:55,585 --> 01:51:59,960
No, no, quality of tapes
do not deteriorate due to storage..

1219
01:52:00,335 --> 01:52:02,001
...but it might if you keep
playing them time and again.

1220
01:52:02,418 --> 01:52:07,126
Someone is constantly telling
the child to say grandpa.

1221
01:52:07,126 --> 01:52:11,376
See if the voice matches
with anyone on the system.

1222
01:53:14,001 --> 01:53:14,876
There's a match.

1223
01:53:15,585 --> 01:53:16,501
With what?

1224
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:17,918
No one on the system.

1225
01:53:18,668 --> 01:53:21,668
But with the voice on the old tape.

1226
01:53:26,335 --> 01:53:27,210
The kidnapper?

1227
01:53:27,210 --> 01:53:27,876
No.

1228
01:53:28,376 --> 01:53:31,168
The person who's asking
the kid to say grandpa.

1229
01:53:32,376 --> 01:53:33,918
It's the same guy who..

1230
01:53:33,918 --> 01:53:37,376
...received the ransom call
in the earlier kidnapping case.

1231
01:53:41,501 --> 01:53:42,501
Grandpa.

1232
01:53:45,293 --> 01:53:46,918
Grandpa help.

1233
01:53:47,751 --> 01:53:50,710
<i>Grandpa hen)'-!</i>

1234
01:53:50,710 --> 01:53:52,085
Loudly.

1235
01:53:52,626 --> 01:53:56,376
'He keeps hearing the
same old tape every night.'

1236
01:53:56,668 --> 01:53:59,085
"Grandpa...! Grandpa...!"

1237
01:53:59,085 --> 01:54:00,751
"I am sorry, grandpa."

1238
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:02,835
"I made a mistake."

1239
01:54:02,835 --> 01:54:05,960
"I will tell you."

1240
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:10,585
This is a list of them.

1241
01:54:11,918 --> 01:54:17,335
Have you ever heard anything
about them, or any records?

1242
01:54:18,001 --> 01:54:19,126
Father..

1243
01:54:19,668 --> 01:54:22,001
My daughter's made this card for you.

1244
01:54:23,043 --> 01:54:24,460
You made this?

1245
01:54:24,918 --> 01:54:26,418
It's really beautiful.

1246
01:54:26,793 --> 01:54:28,960
I'll always keep it with me.

1247
01:55:34,835 --> 01:55:36,085
Manohar Sinha.

1248
01:56:12,918 --> 01:56:14,626
Hey welcome. - Hello, papa.

1249
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,293
Hello, Neeta. How are you?
- Hi, grandpa.

1250
01:56:17,626 --> 01:56:19,251
I love you, grandpa.

1251
01:56:19,251 --> 01:56:20,876
How are you, Ronnie? - I'm fine.

1252
01:56:21,876 --> 01:56:22,918
Good to see you.

1253
01:56:23,585 --> 01:56:25,585
Okay, let's play football - Ready Mom.

1254
01:56:25,585 --> 01:56:27,168
Ronnie, head butt.

1255
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:31,501
Good one.

1256
01:56:32,668 --> 01:56:34,710
You have become a pro.

1257
01:56:50,043 --> 01:56:50,751
Hello.

1258
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:55,876
Did you find anything?

1259
01:56:55,876 --> 01:56:57,043
We have found the location.

1260
01:56:57,043 --> 01:56:58,251
The phone is not moving.

1261
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:13,418
Come on pass.. come on, pass me.

1262
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:17,335
Come on pass.. come on, pass me.

1263
01:57:17,335 --> 01:57:18,793
Kick the ball.

1264
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:24,001
Come on pass.. come on, pass me.

1265
01:57:24,918 --> 01:57:28,085
Yes.. yes.. goal!

1266
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:31,335
Good to see you, Father Martin.

1267
01:57:32,626 --> 01:57:34,668
I knew you would find me.

1268
01:57:37,835 --> 01:57:41,376
Ronnie dear.. - Yes.

1269
01:57:42,376 --> 01:57:43,835
Go get ready, son.

1270
01:57:44,335 --> 01:57:46,418
This uncle will take you home.

1271
01:57:46,835 --> 01:57:48,793
No, I don't want to go home.

1272
01:57:48,793 --> 01:57:51,168
I want to stay here
and play football with you.

1273
01:58:01,793 --> 01:58:07,293
So you knew that
Manohar had kidnapped Angela.

1274
01:58:08,251 --> 01:58:10,918
And you've been planning
this ever since, right?

1275
01:58:15,168 --> 01:58:18,668
I found the kidnapper, not you.

1276
01:58:20,376 --> 01:58:22,585
<i>That day,
after we visited the lmambara..</i>

1277
01:58:22,585 --> 01:58:24,085
...you deserted me.

1278
01:58:26,001 --> 01:58:28,126
But I couldn't desert Angela.

1279
01:58:29,918 --> 01:58:32,043
So I continued my search.

1280
01:59:29,418 --> 01:59:32,043
The day I found him I
could have killed him but..

1281
01:59:32,043 --> 01:59:33,876
...that wouldn't have been justice.

1282
01:59:35,376 --> 01:59:39,960
I would've had my revenge,
but not justice.

1283
01:59:44,585 --> 01:59:47,876
And so I intentionally started this story.

1284
01:59:49,835 --> 01:59:54,210
Because I always knew that
the police will come to you.

1285
01:59:56,418 --> 02:00:02,001
I took special care to make the
kidnapping seem like the earlier one.

1286
02:00:43,293 --> 02:00:45,251
"Why did you call the police?"

1287
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:47,501
"Your grandchild is in my custody."

1288
02:00:47,501 --> 02:00:51,960
"lf you want him back alive then arrange
for two million by tomorrow morning."

1289
02:00:56,918 --> 02:00:57,876
What do you want?

1290
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:00,835
What are you going to do?

1291
02:01:07,668 --> 02:01:10,293
I want a meeting with Manohar.

1292
02:01:11,418 --> 02:01:13,876
No, I can't do that.

1293
02:01:15,793 --> 02:01:16,918
It's not my call.

1294
02:01:18,918 --> 02:01:19,876
Martin..

1295
02:01:22,335 --> 02:01:25,501
No one else can arrange
this meeting other than you..

1296
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,001
Do it..

1297
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:32,251
...and take Ronnie home.

1298
02:01:33,668 --> 02:01:37,751
John uncle come on,
we'll play football together.

1299
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:07,293
Manohar.

1300
02:02:15,793 --> 02:02:20,501
Except for you,
only one other man knew..

1301
02:02:22,251 --> 02:02:27,335
...that <i>8</i> years ago
you kidnapped my Angela.

1302
02:02:29,126 --> 02:02:30,376
And that is me.

1303
02:04:51,293 --> 02:04:54,210
So you fled with the money.

1304
02:04:57,210 --> 02:05:01,293
But you weren't sure
whether she's dead or not.

1305
02:05:02,751 --> 02:05:05,793
That's why you erased all the evidence.

1306
02:05:05,793 --> 02:05:10,668
You just removed.. all evidence.

1307
02:05:25,793 --> 02:05:29,585
It was clever of you
to borrow Kumar's black van.

1308
02:05:30,251 --> 02:05:31,960
The van couldn't have
led anyone directly to you..

1309
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:34,876
...because many
people would hire it.

1310
02:05:36,001 --> 02:05:36,668
But..

1311
02:05:38,751 --> 02:05:39,751
...one day..

1312
02:05:42,418 --> 02:05:44,085
...you ran out of luck

1313
02:05:47,668 --> 02:05:49,001
Your trunk was found.

1314
02:05:50,626 --> 02:05:51,626
Then the pen.

1315
02:05:54,710 --> 02:05:56,418
The.. pen!

1316
02:06:05,543 --> 02:06:06,793
This pen..

1317
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:15,376
This pen led me to you.

1318
02:06:16,793 --> 02:06:18,793
I didn't want to kill her.

1319
02:06:20,626 --> 02:06:23,126
I only wanted to save my daughter Neeta.

1320
02:06:23,918 --> 02:06:26,126
She needed immediate surgery,
and I didn't have the money..

1321
02:06:26,126 --> 02:06:27,418
...and so I did it.

1322
02:06:28,293 --> 02:06:30,376
Back then I was in
a desperate condition..

1323
02:06:30,626 --> 02:06:34,001
...I couldn't decide what's right
or wrong.. Didn't know what to do?

1324
02:06:36,668 --> 02:06:38,085
And even after 8 years..

1325
02:06:38,085 --> 02:06:41,210
...you didn't know what to do?

1326
02:06:43,043 --> 02:06:45,335
The police thinks you have killed Ronnie.

1327
02:06:47,293 --> 02:06:51,543
They are never going
to look for him anymore.

1328
02:06:53,293 --> 02:06:58,376
But you want him to return safely,
don't you?

1329
02:07:01,876 --> 02:07:02,668
Fine.

1330
02:07:04,876 --> 02:07:07,126
I admit I wronged you.

1331
02:07:08,376 --> 02:07:12,543
So tell me.. how can
I rectify my mistake?

1332
02:07:15,085 --> 02:07:16,543
What must I do?

1333
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:31,376
Manoher has confessed.

1334
02:07:36,293 --> 02:07:40,001
Sarita.. Manoher has confessed
to both the kidnappings..

1335
02:07:40,001 --> 02:07:42,335
...and he also gave
us Ronnie's location.

1336
02:07:46,251 --> 02:07:58,251
The star..neither
relented nor feared..

1337
02:07:59,168 --> 02:08:12,710
<i>A ray of light kept
him alive..kept him alive..</i>

1338
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:25,960
<i>Clinging to the few strands of life,
he kept saying“.</i>

1339
02:08:26,251 --> 02:08:32,335
<i>I have the right to burn..</i>

1340
02:08:33,043 --> 02:08:38,335
<i>I have the right to live..</i>

1341
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:45,918
<i>I have a right to the skies...</i>

1342
02:08:46,793 --> 02:08:52,168
<i>I'll take what's my right...</i>

1343
02:08:53,710 --> 02:08:59,210
<i>I'll take what's my right...</i>

1344
02:08:59,710 --> 02:09:02,585
<i>I promise!</i>

1345
02:09:29,085 --> 02:09:31,751
<i>Drops of my blood..</i>

1346
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:40,335
<i>...are still warm.</i>

1347
02:09:42,876 --> 02:09:54,835
<i>I have an unfinished duty.</i>

1348
02:09:55,626 --> 02:10:06,001
<i>I've been counting each passing day,
year after year.</i>

1349
02:10:06,418 --> 02:10:09,043
<i>I've been counting them..</i>

1350
02:10:09,418 --> 02:10:19,710
<i>I've been clinging
to twigs of courage..</i>

1351
02:10:20,085 --> 02:10:22,751
<i>...and kept saying..</i>

1352
02:10:22,751 --> 02:10:28,710
<i>I've the right to burn.</i>

1353
02:10:29,626 --> 02:10:34,876
<i>I've the right to live.</i>

1354
02:10:36,376 --> 02:10:42,210
<i>I've the right to the sky.</i>

1355
02:10:43,001 --> 02:10:48,668
<i>I will take what's mine.</i>

1356
02:10:50,085 --> 02:10:55,668
<i>I will take what's mine.</i>

1357
02:10:56,293 --> 02:10:58,043
<i>I promise.</i>

1358
02:11:19,126 --> 02:11:28,626
<i>I know that I'll die one day..
I'll die...</i>

1359
02:11:32,835 --> 02:11:42,626
<i>But until I die,
I decide how I live...</i>

1360
02:11:45,668 --> 02:11:53,001
<i>Steely is the resolve
of this mortal frame of dust“.</i>

1361
02:11:55,418 --> 02:12:01,710
<i>I have the right to burn..</i>

1362
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:08,418
<i>I have the right to live..</i>

1363
02:12:08,876 --> 02:12:15,835
<i>I have a right to the skies...</i>

1364
02:12:15,835 --> 02:12:22,251
<i>I will take what's mine.</i>

1365
02:12:22,501 --> 02:12:28,751
<i>I will take what's mine.</i>

1366
02:12:28,751 --> 02:12:31,668
<i>Wait and watch!</i>
