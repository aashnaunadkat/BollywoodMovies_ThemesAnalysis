1
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,228
26th November, 2008...Mumbai.

2
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,098
9:54 Pm.

3
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,468
Two unknown men stormed
Chatrapati Terminus..

4
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,603
..and started firing bullets.

5
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,209
For the next three
days and three nights.

6
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,347
...Mumbai was brought
down to its knees.

7
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,392
1O terrorists trained
by Lashkar-e-Taiba.

8
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:38,089
..e><ecuted the most dreadful
attack on Indian soil and..

9
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,565
..turned the city of
Ivlumbai into a battleground.

10
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,103
By the time this
terror attack was over..

11
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:59,409
More than 160 people were dead.

12
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,279
Many bodies had torture
marks on them as well.

13
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:07,348
Seven years later... the
bullet holes have been re-plastered.

14
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,156
The broken windows
have been replaced.

15
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:13,596
But the wounds inflicted on
our heart and mind is still fresh.

16
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,600
Because,
those who planned the attack,

17
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,363
executed it

18
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:24,376
and attacked our pride,
are still sleeping peacefully.

19
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,636
Beyond the grasp of India.

20
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,132
Come on!

21
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,573
What's wrong with you, Man!

22
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,412
Oh no!

23
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,346
Hey!

24
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,315
What's wrong with you?

25
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,297
Oh sttt!

26
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,243
Hands up!

27
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,980
In a case of violent road rage.

28
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:31,120
..a man was thrown off the bridge,
into the icy waters of the river below.

29
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,392
Strangely, police have still
not been able to locate his body.

30
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,260
It's yet to be seen how
that will affect the triaL.

31
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,669
..of the man arrested in
connected with the alleged killing.

32
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:41,728
Thank you, Your Honor.

33
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,602
Case no: 066F505.

34
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,276
State of Illinois Vs Jude Rosario

35
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:49,746
Verdict.

36
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,677
When I tell you to stop,
and turn face the table. Stop.

37
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,683
We the jury find the defendant.

38
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,743
Upper lip. Lower lip.

39
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,353
Tongue up.

40
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,481
Guilty!

41
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,086
Turn around.

42
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,249
Here's your Passport. ..

43
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,548
Pan Card...

44
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,722
Voter ID...

45
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,058
And this - new thing...

46
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,256
Aadhar Card.

47
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,723
Cell Phone...

48
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,199
...and money.

49
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,127
I hope you remember everything.

50
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,764
Get in through Chirai...
then take a bus to Lakimpur.

51
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,407
Stay in Lakhimpur for two months.

52
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,670
Then travel to Uri by train.

53
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,712
Once I get there,
I need to switch on this cell phone.

54
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,441
And get rest of my orders.

55
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,345
And..

56
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,941
No falling in love
with an Indian girl.

57
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,315
Bravo, kid. Go on.

58
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,532
Yeah, tell me.

59
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,661
Ivlousa Hamid.
Resident of Quetta, Pakistan.

60
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,001
His mother died when he was eight.

61
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,667
..and his father died
two years later in Afghanistan.

62
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,712
I don't want his family history...
Get to the point.

63
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,237
During the interrogation
he divulged.

64
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,749
..that Lashkar-e-Taiba is
planning another attack on India.

65
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,507
Where?
- He doesn't know.

66
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,144
He does...make him talk.

67
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,750
Sir, we've already
tortured him to the limit.

68
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,094
He would've definitely
told us if he knew.

69
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,585
Sir.

70
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,500
Sir, even if we manage
to avert this attack..

71
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,092
...we won't be able
to stop the next one.

72
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:25,761
Who is he?

73
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:26,730
Samit Ivlishra.

74
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,797
New deputation from NTRO...
I told you about him.

75
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,598
Sir, they will attack us again.

76
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,601
They will keep attacking
us again and again.

77
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,806
Until they don't
fulfill their motive.

78
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,447
Because no matter how
many times they attack us.

79
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,109
..we never do anything.

80
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,241
Nothing.

81
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,212
We only stop playing cricket.

82
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,751
Sir, I have an idea...

83
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,249
...and this way we can
stop all the attacks.

84
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,361
We can't do that.

85
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,769
Sir, if America can...
why can't we?

86
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,406
You won't find anyone
in the Government.

87
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,466
..to approve this plan.

88
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,070
But sir...there's no need
to tell anyone in the Government.

89
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,782
Where did you find this crazy guy?

90
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,060
Why not, sir?

91
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,664
Because we're not America.

92
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,227
Roy, do you want
to start another war?

93
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,429
Sir...just one more attack,
and we'll be waging war anyway.

94
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,030
You're sounding like those fools.

95
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,440
..who keep screaming
on Facebook "Let's go to War".

96
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,603
"Let's go to War."

97
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:44,479
We can't risk millions of lives
in order to avenge a few hundreds.

98
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,380
Sir, please talk to the PM...

99
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,679
This meeting is over.

100
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,754
Take me back to the office.

101
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,551
Whatever is discussed
in this office cannot be repeated...

102
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:04,227
not to your colleague, not your
father, your wife... not even your dog.

103
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,132
Yes, sir.

104
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,568
Am I clear?
- Yes.

105
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,739
Let's do it.

106
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,601
Sir, this is a suicide mission.

107
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,374
There is no chance of
the team returning alive.

108
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,540
There won't be a team.

109
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,345
Exactly what I was thinking, sir.

110
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,718
Do you have someone in your mind?

111
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,185
We'll have to find some crazy guy,

112
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,178
Isn't it 3 hours yet.

113
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,756
Yes.

114
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,557
Sir...

115
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,253
This is '97 batch.

116
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,090
He lives with his parents.

117
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,195
No, no.

118
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,200
You didn't send me files
of the Northern region.

119
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,136
No! - I sent a request
for army personnel as well.

120
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,138
You didn't send those either.

121
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,675
Won't do. - Please hurry up,
you're taking too long.

122
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:49,612
Too high-profile.

123
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,512
Will attract unnecessary attention.

124
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,608
L-low many times do I
have to remind you'? - No!

125
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,621
Send me those classified
files as soon as possible.

126
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,053
Satyajit Bagga.

127
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,353
BSF Officers.
- I should get everything by tomorrow.

128
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,655
Won't do.
- I've these 3-4 options.

129
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,751
He's too old!

130
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,123
It's been too long.
Did we come too far?

131
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,096
It's somewhere around here.

132
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,498
Address does not exist.
You've left all the pages blank.

133
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,398
What do I do with these?

134
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,993
You're not doing your job,
please pay attention.

135
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,299
Too old, won't do.

136
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,674
Sir, he has no passport, no
driving license... no ration card.

137
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,142
He isn't even on Facebook...
or Twitter.

138
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,712
Sir, on paper he doesn't exist.

139
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,338
Just like Phantom.

140
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,147
Who is he?

141
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,311
Sir, Phantom?

142
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,151
Him?

143
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,482
Sir, there's one piece of
news about him on the internet.

144
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,526
It's quite old,
and without a photograph.

145
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,289
Sir...e><cept for this small problem,
he's the perfect man.

146
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,385
Small problem?

147
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,658
This is a big problem.

148
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,200
But, sir...this is what makes
him our perfect candidate.

149
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,294
Trust me, this is our man.

150
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,105
Daniyal Khan!

151
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,358
But, sir, he refused.

152
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,486
What do you mean he refused?

153
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,760
I didn't send you two so far so that he
says no and you two come running back.

154
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,591
Okay, sir, we'll try again.

155
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,201
We'll pay any amount you want.

156
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,168
What will I do with your money?

157
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,774
I would already be dead.

158
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,202
And I've no interest in being
the richest man in the cemetery.

159
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,678
Please don't waste your time.

160
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,044
I don't want your money.

161
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,244
What about honor?

162
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,714
You were dishonorably discharged
from the Army, Daniyal.

163
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,589
We're giving you a chance
to earn the honor you lost.

164
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,525
Sir, he clearly refused.

165
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,655
What did he say?

166
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,462
So what now, sir?
- Fine, lam coming.

167
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,696
Okay, sir.

168
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,176
Whose foolish idea is this?

169
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,482
If I say...give me 1O illiterate,
street kids.

170
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,356
..and I can create havoc in one
of the biggest cities in the world.

171
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,088
You would've
called that foolish too.

172
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,129
Right?

173
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,661
You certainly would, sir,

174
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,631
But they did it.

175
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,370
And if those 1O illiterate
boys can do it, then why can't we?

176
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,302
They were ignorant, I am not!

177
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,605
Your father, Col. Usmaan Khan.

178
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,148
L-low long has it been
since you two last talked'?

179
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:49,024
Imagine how happy he'll be
to see you in the Indian Army again.

180
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,294
If you do this job, I promise..

181
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,565
...you'll be honorably re-appointed
on the same post in the Army.

182
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:14,209
"Your shoulder sways,
My chest sways,"

183
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:19,188
" l-low will these broken hearted,
Carry the burden of my faith?"

184
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,055
"My infidelity sways,
My loyalty sways."

185
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,561
" Your slave sways"

186
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:29,032
"My lord sways"

187
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:48,448
"l have smiled And broken myself into
a million pieces, For you my lord."

188
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:56,156
"I have scrubbed,
And coloured myself, In your hue."

189
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,158
Hello.

190
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,762
Hello, papa.

191
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:09,303
"You are in the stars, In the earth,
In every direction, My lord."

192
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:19,342
"I surrender, My conscience,
I come home to you."

193
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,456
They will keep killing our people.

194
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,751
And the day isn't far..

195
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,152
..when both our
countries will go to war.

196
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,762
What you're trying to do,
will certainly lead to a war.

197
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:32,994
It won't.

198
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,499
If their deaths look like accident.

199
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,759
They are not fools.

200
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,701
They will soon know
that we're behind this.

201
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,262
I want them to know
that we're behind this.

202
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,042
But they won't have
any proof to accuse us.

203
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,009
For the world, it will be accidents.

204
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,239
Look, Daniyal, we're not
attacking the people of Pakistan.

205
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,678
We just want to
finish the terrorists.

206
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:58,245
In the last 10 years, more than
50,000 Pakistanis have also died..

207
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,790
..in this kind of violence.

208
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,489
<i>We must avenge 26111.</i>

209
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,596
And once Lashkar knows
the consequences of attacking us.

210
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,432
They will think twice
before attacking us again.

211
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,033
But why me?

212
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,331
I'll be honest with you, Daniyal.

213
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,235
For you world you've vanished.

214
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,503
And if you go somewhere for
2-3 months, no one will notice.

215
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:22,339
And if I don't return, it won't
make a difference to anyone, right?

216
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,507
We both know this
is a difficult job.

217
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,017
And you won't get a medal for this..

218
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,179
..nor will your picture
appear on the front page.

219
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,380
Because no one will
know what you did.

220
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,353
Because this mission never existed.

221
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:40,726
Passport...

222
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,064
Tickets...

223
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,198
Cell-phone.

224
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,701
Call only from this phone.

225
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,637
This call will get re-routed from
a third country and then come to us.

226
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,536
Actually, don't call us at all.

227
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,531
Because we don't know you.

228
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,045
Cash...

229
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:57,638
Cards...

230
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,738
Locker key.

231
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,318
And a ticket for tomorrow's match.

232
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,047
Navvaz will meet you there.

233
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,712
There are 30,000 people here.

234
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,639
If he's here,
we've only 2 days to find him.

235
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,208
Are you Navvaz?

236
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,687
10% seats are in the smoking area.

237
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,993
And he's a chain smoker.

238
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,160
So chances are he'll be here.

239
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,757
Why do you want to identify him?

240
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,396
RAWs making a new fi
e..

241
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,437
...of the people involved
in Mumbai attacks.

242
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,768
And as you Know, there's
just one existing photo of this guy.

243
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,335
And that too is very old.

244
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,310
ls that him?

245
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,525
No!

246
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,321
Do you recognize him properly?
- No one does.

247
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,695
I saw him just once.

248
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,499
And after that he underwent
plastic surgery.

249
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,603
So who are we looking for?

250
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,207
Don't worry.

251
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,271
According to the
Intelligence reports.

252
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,709
..his face hasn't changed much.

253
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:42,819
Wait!

254
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,053
Stop! Stop! Stop!

255
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,383
What happened?

256
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,652
What happened?
- He must be somewhere around?

257
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,057
He always breaks the filter
of his cigarette before smoking it.

258
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,254
What are you doing?

259
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,058
Can you get off the ground please?

260
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,395
There must be similar
filters in his vacuum cleaner.

261
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,228
What...

262
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,700
I just saw one.
- Guys, I've got a job to do.

263
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:02,672
What...

264
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,375
What do you do in London?

265
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,514
Can we stick to business?

266
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:25,024
I am a security consultant,
for Dark Water.

267
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,218
It's a private company.

268
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:30,094
..that provides supplies, security and
weapon's training in high risk zones.

269
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,668
To whom?

270
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,534
Those who can afford us.

271
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,403
What's your connection with RAW?

272
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,474
Why are you helping me?

273
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,780
10,000 Pounds.

274
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,484
I identify him,
I get the money.

275
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,384
10,000 Pounds?

276
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,579
You can buy me a drink then.

277
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,454
I think that's him.

278
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,095
You look that way.

279
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,245
Excuse me.

280
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,404
Hello.

281
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:53,339
Hello.

282
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,581
Hello. Hello.

283
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,280
This is a trial for our people.

284
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:08,257
I'm deeply grateful for your help.

285
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,401
It's him.

286
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,733
But you didn't get
a good look at him yet.

287
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,367
But...his voice.

288
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,736
His style of greeting...
it's exactly the same.

289
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,713
'Only one of our agent's
has seen this man.'

290
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,714
'Nawaz Mistry.'

291
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,342
'Back then she was working
for Medicine International.

292
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,409
'75,000 people died and
millions were injured..'

293
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:42,084
'..in the 2005 earthquake
in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.'

294
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,060
'Many medical-aid workers from all
over the world were going there..'

295
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:48,223
'..because Pakistan government
were issuing immediate visas.'

296
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:49,732
'Nawaz was there too.'

297
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,534
'This is the only photo we have.'

298
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,399
'.which was on his
visa application form..'

299
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,099
'..when he came to India
posing as a cricket fan'.

300
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,335
'But after that he changed
his face... Plastic surgery.'

301
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,181
We'll need to confirm it's him.

302
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,654
Okay, you follow him.

303
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,024
If he comes back, call me.

304
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,256
Where are you going?
- I've to be sure it's him.

305
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,394
But.

306
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,103
Sajid Mir.

307
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,773
Lashkaﬁs top military trainer.

308
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,415
Sajicl lvlajid,
Sajicl Bill, Uncle Bill, Abu Bara.

309
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,613
..they are all his aliases.

310
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,053
He's got 26 passports.

311
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,421
He trained all the terrorists
of the 26/11 attack.

312
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,188
Planned all the operations.

313
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,492
And also gave instructions
to the terrorists from Karachi...

314
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,555
...while watching everything
on our news channels.

315
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,623
"Make him stand on the
other side of the door."

316
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,293
"The bullet should
pierce his head."

317
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,403
"Now shoot."

318
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,200
"Just do as I say."

319
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,282
What happened?
- He's coming back.

320
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,180
Did you figure out if it is him?

321
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,121
Hello?

322
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,527
Hello?

323
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:42,429
No!

324
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,224
You'll have to get
closer and confirm.

325
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,233
Are you crazy?

326
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,496
<i>I 'm</i> saying I am pretty sure.

327
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,367
Are you 100% sure?
- Yes, almost.

328
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,771
We're not paying you 10,000
Pounds to be "Almost Sure".

329
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,531
I need you to be a 100% sure,

330
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,441
What do you want to do?
- Ask him for a lighter.

331
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,341
You can see his face closer.

332
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:00,446
Excuse me. Excuse me.

333
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,550
Excuse me.

334
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,111
Can I have a light?

335
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,224
Thanks.

336
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,724
Yes.
- That man and kid.

337
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:43,721
Who are you talking about?

338
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,256
They just stepped out
of the green Volkswagen.

339
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,318
What are you talking about?

340
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,557
They just went inside
the building with Mir.

341
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,098
Get them out. Now!

342
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,690
Vvhy?
- Their lives are in danger.

343
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:53,134
Get the old man and
his daughter out now.

344
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,439
Excuse me...sir?

345
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,339
ls that green Volkswagen yours?

346
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,781
Yes. Why?

347
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,283
The car's alarm just went off.

348
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:10,543
Alarm?

349
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,746
Come quickly.

350
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,688
Where are they?

351
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,424
What the hell is happening?
- Where are those tvvo?

352
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,056
They must be on their way down.

353
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,037
What they hell was that?

354
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,178
Your plan was always to kill him.

355
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,109
You knew he was Sajid as soon as
he entered his apartment.

356
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,207
So why did you tell
me to ask him for a light?

357
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,080
When a chain-smoker
sees someone smoking.

358
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,213
..he feels the urge to
smoke a cigarette himself.

359
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,718
And I wanted him to enter
his apartment with a lit cigarette.

360
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,556
My job was to identify him.

361
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,560
Why did you involve
me in his murder?

362
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,619
Murder?

363
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,723
Do you know how many
people he has Killed'?

364
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,562
We've been looking
for him since 6 years.

365
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,227
I had just one chance to kill him,
and I couldn't lose it..

366
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,600
..no matter what the cost.

367
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,333
Not at my cost.

368
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,268
This is not the way I work!

369
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,579
Sir!

370
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:30,387
The massive explosion that ripped
through the apartment block behind me..

371
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,451
...reportedly killed two people.

372
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:36,259
London Police say that the
explosion was caused by a gas leak.

373
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,733
According to the local counselor,
one of the men.

374
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,101
..was a Pakistani businessman
called Abid Ansari.

375
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,074
Other unconfirmed sources
say...he was also called Abu Bars.

376
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,608
Residents of this area
are shocked by this incident.

377
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,342
Some of the people we spoke
with say that Mr. AnsarL.

378
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,406
..was rarely ever seen by them.

379
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,557
Case no: 066F505.

380
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,198
State of Illinois Vs Jude Rosario.

381
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:15,230
We the jury find the defendant
guilty of second degree murder..

382
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,738
..of Mathew Brody.

383
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,594
David Coleman Headley.

384
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,238
Lashkaﬁs most important man...

385
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,070
...responsible for planning
the attacks on Mumbai.

386
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,040
Mother's American
and Father's Pakistani.

387
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,635
Birth name. . . Davvood Gilani.

388
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,715
But in 2006 he changed his
name to David Coleman Headley.

389
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,117
And made a new American Passport.

390
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,551
Because of this western name.

391
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,282
..it was easier for
him to come to India.

392
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,386
He understands
Hindi/Urdu really well.

393
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,324
But he told people
that he's an American.

394
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,527
Headley searched for
the targets in India.

395
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,498
Gathered GPS coordinates...
and made contacts.

396
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,034
After each trip,
he travelled to Pakistan.

397
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,092
..and showed his videos to Lashkar.

398
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,365
Places where the terrorists
could get in easily.

399
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,672
..attack and return when required.

400
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,173
In 2009 Headley was
apprehended at Chicago airport.

401
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,250
But America refused
to hand him over to India.

402
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,313
Now he's serving a 35
year sentence in Chicago jail.

403
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,063
Hello.

404
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:59,371

that... you're also an Indian.

00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,773
You know who he is, right?

410
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,041
Bloody rascal.

411
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,407
Scoundrel!

412
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:38,179
I feel like...

413
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,051
...ripping out his heart.

414
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,357

00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,107
What do they pay for the most?

419
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,627

All clear!

432
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,492
He's got cat-like eyes.

433
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,400
Every time I see him,

434
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,034
it makes my blood
pressure soar...with anger.

435
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,679
Thank God...they're
taking him away.

L-low may I help you'?

00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:46,545
My name's Daniyal Khan.

506
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,418
I would like to speak
to the High Commissioner.

507
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,286
May I know what this is about?

508
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:52,452
I've information about
Sajid Mir's death.

509
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,188
This is High Commissioner
Sheriyar Baig.

510
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,392
Sajid Mir's death
wasn't an accident.

511
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,029
He was assassinated by RAW.

512
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,439
I wanted to thank you.

513
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:11,104
I don't need your thanks.

514
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,408
I just need to know what
the hell you got me into.

515
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:14,547
What do you want?

516
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,484
I want to avenge my dishonorable
discharge from the Indian Army.

517
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,315
Why are you telling me all this?

518
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,651
I want to meet Lashkaﬁs
leader in Pakistan.

519
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:25,353
If you tell them that
India assassinated Sajid Mir..

520
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,688
..then what's the point of setting
everything up to look like an accident?

521
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,690
He'll show your
evidence to the vvor
d..

522
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:33,099
..and make a case against India.

523
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,568
For the last 6 years Pakistan
has been telling the world.

524
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:38,699
..that there's no
such man as Sajid Mir.

525
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:42,144
L-low can you Kill someone
who doesn't exist'?

526
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,406
And what did the
High Commissioner say?

527
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,640
Bloody fool!

528
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:48,081
You think I am Lashkaﬁs servant.

529
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,675
I am the High
Commissioner of Pakistan.

530
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,378
..not a representative of Lashkar.

531
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,113
Don't ever call back again.

532
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,962
Why did you quit RAW?

533
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,437
What is the point
of this conversation?

534
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:12,134
I have to go.

535
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,040
Where are you going?
- Beirut.

536
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:16,639
Why Beirut?

537
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:19,473
You ask too many questions.

538
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,142
Usually we charge
for such information,

539
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,122
VVell...l can pay for your coffee.

540
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:32,025
We're providing security and materials
to the Syrian refugee camps.

541
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,118
Syria?

542
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:36,357
Even Lashkaﬁs fighters
are involved in that battle.

543
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:39,628
That's too much information
for a cup of coffee.

544
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,039
Good luck.

545
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,245
Hello, Pakistan High Commission,
how may I help you'?

546
00:47:57,308 --> 00:48:00,721
This is Daniyal Khan speaking.
- Okay. Please hold.

547
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,420
Sir, it's that Daniyal
Khan calling again.

548
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,086
Tell him I am not here.

549
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,094
Sorry, sir, the High Commissioner
is not here at the moment.

550
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:08,960
Thank you.

551
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,021
Do you know when?

552
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:19,641
Hello.
- Daniyal Khan.

553
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:22,075
Yes. - What do you
know about Sajid Mir.

554
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,976
Sajicfs death wasn't an accident.

555
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,239
He was assassinated.

556
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:27,214
L-low do you know Sajid Mir's dead'?

557
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:31,310
Fine, then Abid Ansari...or
Sajid Majid, or Abu Bara.

558
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,752
One of them is definitely dead.

559
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,684
I've proof that the
man who died in that room..

560
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,550
..usecl all these aliases.

561
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,026
Do you want to see?

562
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,427
Why are you calling us from London?

563
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:43,325
Either you're a fool...
or you think I am one.

564
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,761
Why would an ex-lndian Army
officer contact you from India.

565
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,035
Give us your number.
- No, I will contact you.

566
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,405
Give me your number.

567
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,634
Write it down.

568
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,941
What do you think, Firoz?

569
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,552
Sir, I don't believe
this man at all.

570
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,216
But how did he Know..

571
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,193
..that the person who died
in the gas explosion was Sajid Mir?

572
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,728
What proof can he have?

573
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,123
I think this is some
kind of a trick, Haider sir.

574
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:20,430
But if he's telling the truth,
he can be really useful to us.

575
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,693
Find out more about him.

576
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,334
What do you want from us?

577
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:27,603
I want to come to Pakistan.

578
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:31,441
..and meet Lashkaﬁs chief
Haaris Saaed or Sabauddin Umavi.

579
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,504
You can't come to Pakistan.

580
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,351
We have agents in London.

581
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,047
Go see them and
show them your proof.

582
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:41,681
I don't want to meet your agents.

583
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,458
...I want to meet
the leader of Lashkar.

584
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:48,063
Can you come to Afghanistan?
- No.

585
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,122
There are too many Indian agents.

586
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,564
They can spot me.

587
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,627
Then there's nothing we can do.

588
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,495
There is one place.

589
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,340
Syria.

590
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,600
Lashkaﬁs men are
stationed there too.

591
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,174
Call back in five minutes.

592
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,054
Sir, Syria?
- That's the right place.

593
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,350
That place is filled with
Lashkar's people as well as ours.

594
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,425
If he's telling the truth,
we'll bring him to Pakistan.

595
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,586
If he's lying,
he'll be another dead body.

596
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:21,388
No one will notice in Syria.

597
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:27,795
Get to Syria.

598
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,499
If you're smart, you can
rendezvous with Lashkaﬁs people.

599
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:31,404
But.

600
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,095
Hello.

601
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:07,474
What?

602
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,345
I need to get to Syria.

603
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,540
Are you crazy?

604
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,379
It's a vvarzone.

605
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,213
I want to meet with
Lashkaﬁs people.

606
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,309
Then go.

607
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:21,319
Every self styled Jihadi is going
to Syria to fight.

608
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:23,014
You can join them too.

609
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,020
No one's asking for
a visa or passport.

610
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,359
But only you know where
I can find Lashkaﬁs people.

611
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,634
If I try to find them myself,
it will take longer.

612
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,167
I don't have time.

613
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,430
Daniyal, I don't know
where Lashkaﬁs people are.

614
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:39,031
We're just providing refugee camps...
- Come on, Nawaz.

615
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,373
We all know what Dark
Water does in reality.

616
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:45,313
Refugee camps are just a front.

617
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:50,782
America supplies weapons to Jihadis
in Syria through Dark Water.

618
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,682
And Lashkar is part
of those rebel forces too.

619
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,418
So you must know where they are.

620
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:06,501
Why do you always trouble me?

621
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,414
Hello.

622
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:43,804
Seems like ISI has already
informed Lashkar about you.

623
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,537
Thank you.

624
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,285
Hello.

625
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,736
We know you're a RAW agent.

626
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,645
I am not a RAW agent.

627
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:07,020
He hasn't spoken yet, Qureshi sir.

628
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,681
This is what he gave us.

629
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,022
Where did you get these?

630
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,463
I have my sources.

631
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:22,195
If I can get these,
then imagine what else I can get.

632
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,501
Where did you get them?

633
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:30,067
I just need a opportunity
to avenge my humiliation.

634
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,074
Military facilities...

635
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:33,341
Air bases.

636
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:36,775
I have all the inside information.

637
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,721
All the signal towers
are down due to the war.

638
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,785
It's difficult to get a network.

639
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,531
Fine...I'll send this
once I get to Salayicldin.

640
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,202
If you don't take me to Pakistan.

641
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:58,134
...believe me,
you will always regret it.

642
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,703
Our chiefs in Pakistan will decide.

643
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,240
..if we will regret this or you.

644
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:06,314
Keep him here until
I don't speak with them.

645
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,371
Sir.

646
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:16,457
Alam!

647
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,150
Follow them and let me
know where they are going.

648
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,661
Seems like the battle
has started again.

649
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:33,466
8*“! Let's do this fast.

650
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,049
Hello.

651
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,150
Qureshi sir, what do we do with him?

652
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,424
Get out of there quickly.

653
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,755
Yes, sir.

654
00:55:58,589 --> 00:55:59,499
We're out.

655
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,503
No, sir...it's difficult
to get out that way.

656
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,262
I'll bring him to Salayiddin.

657
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,043
What have you done?

658
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,014
Daniyal,
government forces are advancing.

659
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:18,747
My plan was working fine!

660
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,978
You ruined everything.

661
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:22,154
If..

662
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,365
Somethings wrong.

663
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:36,630
Let's get out of this area quickly.

664
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,065
Come on...move.

665
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:56,352
Q Kay-

666
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,185
He's close-by, Take left.

667
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,296
If we don't find that guy,
I'm dead.

668
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,303
And if the Syrian army catches us.

669
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,270
..they will shoot us
thinking we're rebels.

670
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,164
Then we're all dead.

671
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:15,236
Take a right.

672
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,280
Hello.

673
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:24,012
Why haven't you sent the video yet?

674
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:36,491
S**** Syrian Arm y.

675
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:38,628
Hang on!

676
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,570
Sir, all the signals
in this area are down.

677
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:53,012
I am trying,
but the video isn't going through.

678
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:05,719
Come on.

679
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,104
There he is.

680
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:23,672
Let's go.

681
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:38,590
Hello...

682
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,206
What's going on?

683
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,005
Someone's firing on us, sir?
- Who’?

684
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:58,103
I don't know...it's hard to say.

685
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,188
Send his video quickly.

686
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,451
Sir, the signals really bad...
I am not being able to send it.

687
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:16,727
Get up!

688
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:47,324
Sending it now.

689
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:00,531
Daniyau

690
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,089
Find out who is Daniyal Khan.

691
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:19,116
We'll have to show these rascals...
that we can play this game too.

692
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,241
Rajan Sampat died
in a gas explosion.

693
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:14,009
Exactly like the way Sajid Mir died.

694
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:15,708
This can't be a coincidence.

695
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:17,344
They know, sir.

696
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,354
Sir, it's all because
of what went down in Syria.

697
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,679
Savavav!

698
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,219
"Is there a connection
between these two deaths?"

699
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,192
"I\/Ir. Singh?"

700
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:27,751
"There's a very clear connection."

701
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,259
"Gas explosion for a gas explosion."

702
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,696
"Rajah Sampafs death
is revenge Killing."

703
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:35,236
"You mean to say that
the Indian Government."

704
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,636
"..is behind the assassination
of the ISI agent."

705
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,434
Roy. .-

706
01:01:39,763 --> 01:01:42,471
...did your people kill Sajid Mir?

707
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,704
No, sir.

708
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:47,214
There's no question
of our men being involved.

709
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:50,110
Sir, we don't have
permission to do all this.

710
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:51,743
Of course you don't, Roy.

711
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:55,189
And don't you forget that.
- Sir!

712
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:57,715
Sir!

713
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,727
The man you killed in Syria
was not on our list, Daniyal.

714
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:02,258
Sir, I already told you.

715
01:02:02,653 --> 01:02:04,132
Things got out of control.

716
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,357
I didn't have any other choice.

717
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:07,424
That was a stupid mistake.

718
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:09,400
Now they know everything about you.

719
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,530
Before things get out of hand,
I want you to come back.

720
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:13,404
Sir, he couldn't
send the video.

721
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,167
They just heard my name.

722
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:16,744
We can still..
- It's over, Daniyal.

723
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,545
The media is talking.

724
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:20,340
The Government is
getting suspicious.

725
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,246
We will be in serious trouble.

726
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,080
But, sir...
- The mission is over.

727
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,618
Come back, right now.

728
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,645
So that's it.

729
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,055
The main terrorists in Pakistan.

730
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:33,788
..who were responsible for Ivlumbai
attacks will never face trial.

731
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,564
Everything you did
until now will be a waste.

732
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,394
It'll mean nothing.

733
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:43,270
If you were planning to run
away at the first sight of trouble..

734
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:46,102
..then why say yes..
- I am not running away, Nawaz!

735
01:02:48,198 --> 01:02:49,438
lam not running away!

736
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,121
There was a young
soldier in the army,

737
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,259
Dilavvar Singh.

738
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:17,366
Every morning he would
salute me enthusiastically.

739
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,764
With respect. .

740
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,337
With passion.

741
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,580
Do you know why I agreed to
do this mission?

742
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:37,553
Because I want to see the same respect
in Dilavvar Singh's eyes for me.

743
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:40,256
I want him to salute me again.

744
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:44,260
With the same enthusiasm.
The same passion.

745
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:53,540
What happened?

746
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:05,114
In the Doda Sector, we were
trying to save our Winter post.

747
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,619
Amidst continuous shelling
for almost 72 hours.

748
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,684
Radio.
- Radio is down, sir.

749
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:14,628
Alpha...

750
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:16,521
Sir...
- Alpha Tiger 1 2 3...

751
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,621
if the reinforcements
don't arrive soon..

752
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,758
..we won't be able to
hold them off for too long.

753
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:23,032
We're just four
hours away from them.

754
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:25,302
Prepare two soldiers.

755
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:30,669
Sir..

756
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,080
I'll go, sir.

757
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:36,040
'None of them were
in any condition to walk.'

758
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,052
'No one had slept or
eaten since three days.'

759
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:44,291
'I left my men in the bunker,
and decided to go alone.'

760
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,626
‘When they found me,
I was far away from my bunker.‘

761
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:36,439
'All my men in the
bunker were dead.'

762
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:39,343
'I was discharged from the army.'

763
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:43,245
'For deserting my post and my men.'

764
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:03,501
Daniyal, I can take us to Pakistan.

765
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:09,442
Us?

766
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:12,469
Us!

767
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,266
Madam, please.

768
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,269
This way please.

769
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:43,735
Hello.

770
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,972
Hello.

771
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:46,874
Look into the camera.

772
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,813
Arif Ivlirza.
- Yes.

773
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:52,643
What is the purpose of your visit?

774
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,552
I work with Medicine International.

775
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,884
It's good to have you back in
Medicine International Nawaz.

776
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:57,754
Thank you so much.

777
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:00,754
This is my friend,
Arif iviirza from South Africa.

778
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:04,162
He's done extensive work with
NGOs in Namibia and South Africa.

779
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,722
Can I see your ID card please?

780
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:07,824
L-low long are you planning to stay'?

781
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:08,995
1O days.

782
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:11,938
Thank you.

783
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,038
Thank you.

784
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:14,138
Excuse me.

785
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,742
This way please.

786
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,084
Firoz.
- Sir.

787
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,988
Why is it taking so long
to gather information about one man?

788
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,186
There's very little information
available on Daniyal Khan, sir.

789
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,287
It's been two weeks, and you..
- Sir.

790
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,961
It's true that he
was court-martialed.

791
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:39,658
There are reports on the internet.

792
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:42,761
Other than that we know that
his father is a retired Colonel.

793
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,897
His parents live alone in Devlali.

794
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:47,800
304 & 305!

795
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:49,104
Have a pleasant stay, sir.

796
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,143
Thank you.

797
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,645
Call the US Embassy.

798
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:53,271
I want files on every inmate.

799
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,573
..that was in prison
when Headley died.

800
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:57,710
And...ask one of our men..

801
01:07:57,774 --> 01:07:59,720
..to pay a visit to
Daniyal Khan's parents.

802
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,050
I clearly said no.

803
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:02,089
Yes, sir.

804
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,124
But he still went to Pakistan.

805
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,716
Sir, now that he's there..

806
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,022
..we should help him.

807
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,994
That's what I think.

808
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:10,664
Who's our trusted contact in Lahore?

809
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,257
Sir, Khalid. He runs a small eatery in
lvlohalla Johar for the past three years.

810
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,269
To keep an eye on
Haaris Saeecfs movements.

811
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:18,329
Ask Vinay from the consulate
to contact Daniyal.

812
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,109
Yes.

813
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:34,286
Vishal Singh,
voter ID registration officer.

814
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:37,024
I need to confirm some
details for the voter ID.

815
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:39,887
L-low many members in your family.

816
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,930
Me, my husband...and my son.

817
01:08:42,986 --> 01:08:45,830
Can I see a photo
of your husband and son?

818
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:46,730
Photo?

819
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,927
Just to check.

820
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:49,026
Elections are around the corner.

821
01:08:49,092 --> 01:08:50,537
We've had many cases
of fake voter cards.

822
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:52,595
Department's orders...
that's why we're insisting.

823
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,107
Checking photos...etcetera.

824
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,784
Daniyal Khan.

825
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,120
Can I see his photo?

826
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,287
I don't have a recent one,
it's a bit old.

827
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,319
Will do.

828
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:17,222
Fine.

829
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,129
We've found his picture, sir.

830
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,792
But he says it's a bit old.

831
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:45,886
Call the US Embassy...immediately.

832
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:49,054
I will pay back
every penny...l swear.

833
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,995
You hardly earn 2000 a month.

834
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,158
L-low do you plan to repay 100,000'?
- I really love Aasia.

835
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,970
Once we get married,
my luck will change as well.

836
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,063
Normally the bride's
parents pay for the wedding.

837
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:01,233
She belongs to a poor family.

838
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,067
They can't afford to throw
a feast for the entire community.

839
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:04,908
And you're a king
of some sort, right?

840
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:07,242
So you won't help me?
- No.

841
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:09,142
Where are you going?

842
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:10,547
Who will arrange these?

843
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,951
Make this fatso do it,
all he does is sit and eat.

844
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:15,055
Yes, mister.

845
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:17,648
One tea...tvvo fritters.
- Hurry up.

846
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:24,959
And...the guys were all
praises about your sweet-lumps.

847
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:30,568
Yes, but its only
available in the evening.

848
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,206
That's his home.

849
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,682
Lashkar-e-Taiba's supreme leader.

850
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,010
L-I aaris Saeed.

851
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,110
His name's on every Most
Wanted list in the world.

852
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:48,053
But he roams freely
without any fear.

853
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:51,615
He's protected by Lashkaﬁs
people armed with Kalashnikovs.

854
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:52,818
..and the police too.

855
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,223
And of course, the ISI.

856
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,119
The American Government
has announced a reward.

857
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,165
..of 1O million dollars on his head.

858
01:10:58,221 --> 01:10:59,723
But everyone knows where he lives.

859
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,132
He's also on Twitter.

860
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,102
And Umavi,
is he really in Rawalpindi Jail.

861
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:08,131
Mister, I would rather
call it a hotel.

862
01:11:08,198 --> 01:11:10,644
Since the time he's been there,
he's fathered two children.

863
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,246
Even the Pakistan government
have to show the Americans.

864
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:16,546
..that we're serious
about suppressing Lashkar,

865
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,209
So they sent him
to prison for namesake.

866
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,149
Move it aside.

867
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:29,289
Haaris Saeed is holding
a huge rally in 5 days.

868
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:30,155
Daniyal.

869
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:34,861
Even if we get our hands on one,
it'll be impossible get the other.

870
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:37,699
The entire Pakistani police
and army will be out looking for us.

871
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,795
Unless...

872
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:41,603
India wants to destroy Pakistan's.

873
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,510
..peace and serenity completely.

874
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:47,912
And these conspiracies
have weakened Pakistan.

875
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:53,517
And today those people sitting
in Delhi are saying.

876
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:57,022
..that they've put
a price on my head.

877
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,921
Jihad isn't about kill him or
him...or about killing every infidel.

878
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:02,963
Whoever points their
weapons at us...

879
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:05,021
Tries to jeopardize our freedom...

880
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:07,030
Tries to harm our country...

881
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:12,765
The air of terrorism
that's building up..

882
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,206
But no...

883
01:12:20,737 --> 01:12:22,683
It's just 100,000, brother.

884
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,750
I swear I'll never
ask for anything else.

885
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,753
Why should I lend you 100,000?

886
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:28,550
Marriage is a one-time affair,
brother.

887
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:30,557
Friends, relatives. . .the community.

888
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,484
And 100,000 isn't too much.

889
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,086
Food. ..drinks. ..decoration. ..
tables, chairs...

890
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:38,723
Photos. . . lightings. ..stereo!

891
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:40,734
It all adds up to this amount.

892
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:41,928
I swear.

893
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:43,061
When are you getting married?

894
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,138
As soon as he lends me the money.

895
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,903
Mom's come down too...
from my hometown, all decked.

896
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:51,207
She's waiting to see
my wedding procession.

897
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:54,209
For the moment when her prince's
wedding procession comes home.

898
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:55,605
I swear...

899
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:57,709
You can swear all you want.

900
01:12:57,807 --> 01:12:59,115
I won't lend you a penny.

901
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,916
Those Ivlujahiddin were
much better than him.

902
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,818
They were recruiting
me at the training camps.

903
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,018
..for 3000 a month.

904
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:07,255
They were also giving automatic
guns and boots to wear.

905
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:09,793
And they would've sacrificed
your life by now too.

906
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,763
So what?
I would've gone to Heaven.

907
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,095
It would've been
better than your shop.

908
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,931
So you're eager to go to Heaven,
are you?

909
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:19,905
Umavi has an old back problem.

910
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,538
Every week a doctor from Lahore.

911
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:22,735
..goes to the jail
to give him an injection.

912
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:24,140
When is the doctor visiting next?

913
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,235
He goes every Friday.

914
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:27,804
Which means his ne><t
visifs on the 14th.

915
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,242
One day before the rally.

916
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:33,677
Can we approach the doctor?
- Don't even think about it.

917
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:35,119
He's been with him for 2O years.

918
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:37,590
His loyalty lies with Lashkar.

919
01:13:37,647 --> 01:13:39,752
You cannot break him.
Not with force nor money.

920
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,825
But yes...the doctor
has an old nurse.

921
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:44,823
Amina Bi.

922
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:47,163
Sir! Sir! Sir!

923
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:49,837
The Americans have sent
the Chicago inmate files.

924
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:52,499
Great. I want printouts
of every file.

925
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:05,018
Greetings, mister.
- Greetings.

926
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,179
There was a function at school.

927
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,716
I need to rent some stuff.

928
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:09,950
What will you need?

929
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:13,152
VVell...l need one of those
big mikes used in functions.

930
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,162
You mean these?
- Yes, that.

931
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:17,528
Haaris Saeecfs rally is on the 15th.

932
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,827
And the doctor will be
visiting Umavi on the 14th.

933
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:21,630
Even if both our plans succeed..

934
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:24,035
..we can't kill both
of them at the same time.

935
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,231
It's just not possible.

936
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,272
It's possible.

937
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:30,600
If Umavi's doctor visits
him on the 15th instead of the 14th.

938
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,141
And how will that happen'?

939
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:36,642
Khalid was telling me about
a nurse at that doctor's clinic.

940
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,709
Your notion was right.

941
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:39,810
The equipment for the rally.

942
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,220
..is being supplied by Rasheed.
- Good.

943
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:46,927
Listen, I need to speak
to you about Shehzacfs marriage.

944
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,485
Shehzacfs marriage?

945
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,496
We'll take your
plaster off in a week.

946
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:55,603
The doctor's leaving in 1O minutes.

947
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,264
And he's asking for Hamid
Adam's medicines, immediately.

948
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:02,109
Khalid was talking about him.

949
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,740
Her husband passed away
one year after their marriage.

950
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:07,973
She had only one son. Arshad.

951
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:09,812
Amina Bi raised him alone.

952
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:12,577
He became a suicide
bomber for Lashkar.

953
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,988
Khalid was saying,
after Arshacfs death.

954
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:20,687
..few of Lashkaﬁs leaders
came to her...to show sympathy.

955
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:21,728
And to give her the money..

956
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:23,923
..vvhich is normally given
to the family of suicide bombers.

957
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,660
Amina Bi refused to take the money.

958
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:30,965
He never listens.

959
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,769
In fact, she didn't let
them set foot in the house.

960
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:34,998
What do you mean isn't not there?

961
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:36,600
Didn't you ask him?

962
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:38,202
I got up at 4:30..

963
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:39,810
And now you expect me to..

964
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,885
I'm getting you married in 2 days.

965
01:15:47,744 --> 01:15:48,916
Are you listening?

966
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:50,889
I'm getting you married.

967
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:54,024
I don't like such sick jokes.

968
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:55,791
It's true.

969
01:16:02,492 --> 01:16:03,562
Here.

970
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:04,627
This is 50,000.

971
01:16:04,694 --> 01:16:06,970
And I'm giving you 300,000
instead of 100,000.

972
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:08,508
Let there be a grand wedding.

973
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:10,101
I'll give you the rest tomorrow.

974
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,836
Take it. It's yours.

975
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:13,011
Mine?

976
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,777
Stop staring. It's yours.

977
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,515
Thank you, brother. Thank you.

978
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:22,980
I will never forget this favor.

979
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:25,025
I will return every penny.

980
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,584
Let go...or I'll
cancel your wedding.

981
01:16:33,056 --> 01:16:35,036
I'll go tell my mom.

982
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,664
Now you see how Prince Shehzad
will get married.

983
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:54,052
Greetings.

984
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,745
Greetings.

985
01:16:55,912 --> 01:17:00,725
My name's Nawaz Ivlistry.
I work for Medicine International.

986
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,760
We're running a medical
relief camp out here.

987
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:07,898
But we're short on volunteers...
especially medical staff.

988
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,733
Are you Pakistani?
- Yes.

989
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:12,301
Your accent is different.

990
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:14,038
I'm a Parsi.

991
01:17:14,197 --> 01:17:16,871
My family's in South
Africa...since decades.

992
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:19,004
But we've worked
many years in Pakistan.

993
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:22,072
We need experienced people like you.

994
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,175
Would you like to
work at this clinic?

995
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,617
Any amount of time
that you can share?

996
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,587
No.

997
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:43,003
I heard about your son.

998
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:47,740
We get many blast
victims of Arshacfs age.

999
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,975
You lost your son.

1000
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,875
You can understand their pain.

1001
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:56,712
I think you should leave.

1002
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,110
Please visit the camp once.

1003
01:17:59,642 --> 01:18:02,282
See the condition they are in.

1004
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:04,580
We really need your help.

1005
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:07,694
The rest is up to you,
whether you want to help us or not.

1006
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:09,856
Good bye!

1007
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,757
L-low many files, Firoz'?

1008
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:17,565
Sir, I've scanned
through half of it.

1009
01:18:17,627 --> 01:18:19,629
And finish the rest
by tomorrow night.

1010
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,871
4 mikes,
2 speakers and disco lights.

1011
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:23,808
For a wedding.

1012
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:26,278
When is the wedding?
- Day after tomorrow.

1013
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:28,214
Day after tomorrow?

1014
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,147
And you're giving the order so soon?

1015
01:18:30,606 --> 01:18:32,085
Are you running away with the girl?

1016
01:18:33,009 --> 01:18:35,285
I'm joking.
14th isn't possible.

1017
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:36,646
There's a rally on the 15th.

1018
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,556
Look, l'll send back all the stuff
clay after tomorrow night itself.

1019
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,525
Safe and sound.

1020
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,824
That's alright,
but this is impossible.

1021
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,865
After all, it's Mr. Sheikws rally.

1022
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:46,963
Where else can I go now?

1023
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,729
That's your problem.

1024
01:18:51,794 --> 01:18:55,207
Look...
'

 pay you
the money in advance.

1025
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:57,304
Cash.

1026
01:18:58,834 --> 01:18:59,812
Huh!

1027
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:02,748
And you can keep your share too.

1028
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:06,050
What do you want?

1029
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,653
I'll go take a look.

1030
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,559
Two children.

1031
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:26,601
3 year old girl and 7 month old boy.

1032
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:29,174
She had gone to buy toys
for them from jumma market.

1033
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,215
He's just 16 years old.

1034
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:44,849
Lost both his legs at the
blast outside the big mosque.

1035
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:23,654
I didn't know anything.

1036
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:28,763
I had no clue...
when he set out on this path.

1037
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,671
If only I Knew...l would've
never let him do it.

1038
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:36,800
I would've put him
on a muzzle, but.

1039
01:20:36,966 --> 01:20:43,247
I would've never allowed
him to spread such terror.

1040
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,113
Sit down.

1041
01:20:50,746 --> 01:20:52,748
"It's the Call Of Allah."

1042
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:54,925
"You'll be sent to Heaven."

1043
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,656
"A martyﬁs face glows with grace."

1044
01:20:58,721 --> 01:21:01,133
This is what they told
him and took him along.

1045
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:05,901
But he returned in plastic bags.

1046
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:09,838
Poor boy...didn't even have a face.

1047
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:13,610
They had slaughtered my son.

1048
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:18,711
And to make sure that Arshacfs
coffin doesn't seem light.

1049
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:25,621
..they put stones
along with pieces of my child.

1050
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:36,927
No mother should face what you did.

1051
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:42,839
Those who separate children
from their mothers.

1052
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:46,641
..and turn them into murderers...

1053
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:49,979
...should be sent to hell.

1054
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:55,654
Don't you want the people.

1055
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:59,716
..who took your Arshad
from you to pay?

1056
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:01,584
Who are you?

1057
01:22:01,684 --> 01:22:02,856
We need your help.

1058
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,226
What help?

1059
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:07,699
We need your help in saving these
kids from turning into murderers.

1060
01:22:07,857 --> 01:22:08,801
Get out.

1061
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,234
You can save many more lives.

1062
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:12,772
I said get out.

1063
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,569
You know the pain
of losing your son.

1064
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:17,939
Think about the thousands
of mothers like you.

1065
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:19,875
Get out now.

1066
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:23,977
Aunty, is everything fine?

1067
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:26,209
Open the door.

1068
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:30,155
What?

1069
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:42,231
"My infidelity sways,"

1070
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:43,765
"My loyalty sways."

1071
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:46,272
"Your slave sways,"

1072
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:50,944
"My lord sways."

1073
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,611
"The first and last letters"

1074
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:54,045
"Of revelation sway,"

1075
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,845
"Heaven and earth sway,"

1076
01:22:56,872 --> 01:23:01,617
"The skies swoon and sway."

1077
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:06,757
"I won't be able to tell my truth,"

1078
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:09,829
"You won't be able
to bear my truth,"

1079
01:23:09,885 --> 01:23:13,890
"My Lord."

1080
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,201
"Let me just keep giving my life,"

1081
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:18,897
"In your name,"

1082
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:22,534
"My lord."

1083
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:44,923
Out of these 2000 inmates.

1084
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,490
..275 came after Headley.

1085
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:49,126
And 115 of them are still in.

1086
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:54,163
So around 160 of them arrived
in jail after Head
ey..

1087
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,176
..and were released after his death.

1088
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,837
Give me details of these 160 files.

1089
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,969
When is the doctor visiting Umavi?

1090
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:02,080
Tomorrow.

1091
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,814
Can you do something.

1092
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:08,946
..to make him go day
after instead of tomorrow.

1093
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,151
Jude Rosario.

1094
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:15,827
He was imprisoned few
days Before Head
ey's killing.

1095
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,091
..for the murder of some
stuntman called Mathew Brody.

1096
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:22,098
But few days after l-leadleg/'s
I<illing...Mathew Brody was found alive.

1097
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:25,568
Since there was no murder case,
Jude Rosario was released.

1098
01:24:25,995 --> 01:24:27,099
Yes...

1099
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:28,769
Yes, coming.

1100
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:31,603
Give it.

1101
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:32,907
Thank you.

1102
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:23,657
Hello, doctor.
- Hello.

1103
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:25,790
How's everything.
- It's the grace of Allah.

1104
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:28,562
Check his bag properly.
- Take a good look.

1105
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,898
Same old things that
I bring every week.

1106
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,631
Agreed, doctor.

1107
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:33,673
But it's our duty,
we have to do it.

1108
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:34,833
Of course..

1109
01:25:36,198 --> 01:25:37,506
Hold on.

1110
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,042
What's wrong, doctor?

1111
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,978
Hello. - Amina Bi,
you packed the wrong injections.

1112
01:25:49,044 --> 01:25:50,955
I apologies, doctor.

1113
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:54,754
I don't know how.. - I wonder
what's gotten into you these days.

1114
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:57,821
I apologies, doctor.
It won't happen again.

1115
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,793
I'll have to come back tomorrow.

1116
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:05,899
Last time...
do you know who this man is?

1117
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:08,567
I told you...
I don't know him.

1118
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:09,675
No...

1119
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:16,175
Now...do you recognize this man?

1120
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:32,029
Sir, according to
our agent in Chicago.

1121
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:33,760
..Jude Rosario paid a
fat amount to Mathew Brody..

1122
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:35,768
..for falling off the bridge.

1123
01:26:35,824 --> 01:26:36,928
It was a fake case all along.

1124
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:40,030
It means this man Jude Rosario
went to prison intentionally.

1125
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,143
The stuffs here.

1126
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,610
Setup two mikes and
speakers on the stage.

1127
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,010
..and give me the rest of it.

1128
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,878
Bring me Daniyal Khan's photo.

1129
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:58,587
"My heart's been murdered."

1130
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:00,593
"Your gaze is a killer."

1131
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:02,595
"A lovely damsel."

1132
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:04,688
"A glowing beauty."

1133
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:10,066
...has been fixed with Razia Abicl
Ali for a compensation of 5000 coins.

1134
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:11,195
Do you accept?

1135
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,204
I accept.

1136
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:14,241
"Like the Aghan delicacy."

1137
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:15,570
Do you accept?

1138
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,734
I accept.

1139
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:18,106
Do you accept?

1140
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,305
I accept.

1141
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:20,941
"Oh wow!"

1142
01:27:21,003 --> 01:27:24,780
"Are you going to love me...
at gunpoint."

1143
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,014
"Or will you ever
show your face too.

1144
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:28,884
"Oh wow!"

1145
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:29,922
Sir.

1146
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,152
It's him...bloody..

1147
01:27:33,215 --> 01:27:35,058
Daniyal Khan is Jude Rosario.

1148
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:37,097
"Like the Aghan delicacy."

1149
01:27:37,152 --> 01:27:39,063
"A treacherous lover."

1150
01:27:39,154 --> 01:27:41,259
"Your lover's mortally wounded."

1151
01:27:41,557 --> 01:27:42,797
"oh wow!

1152
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:44,963
I want pictures of every person..

1153
01:27:45,027 --> 01:27:47,530
..who entered Pakistan
after Qureshi's murder.

1154
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:48,074
Sir.

1155
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:51,043
Contact every big and small
airports... every entry point.

1156
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:04,784
Hello.

1157
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:05,620
Hello.

1158
01:28:05,714 --> 01:28:06,920
Yes.
- What?

1159
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:11,892
Khalid. It's ready.

1160
01:28:13,222 --> 01:28:14,200
I'll check right away.

1161
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:15,064
Don't worry, sir.

1162
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,033
I'll check all the photos right now.

1163
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:16,933
I'll check, sir.

1164
01:28:17,693 --> 01:28:21,664
"I am a decent guy,
my faith's in Allah."

1165
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:29,808
"But after I played this game,
I am good for nothing now."

1166
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:33,843
"I recited a sonnet of Mir."

1167
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:37,982
"And took a sip of liquor."

1168
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:41,687
"And now my name's tainted."

1169
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,752
"O Sweetheart."

1170
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,799
"O beautiful girl."

1171
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,629
"You're an arrow."

1172
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:49,760
"And my heart's the target."

1173
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:53,830
"She'll fear God
if not her devotees."

1174
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:55,966
"Keep your promises."

1175
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:58,068
"O wow!"

1176
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:29,867
"I'll go and complain
about You to God."

1177
01:29:29,965 --> 01:29:31,945
The second one's ready as well.

1178
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:34,505
I'll use this to make a trigger.

1179
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:36,048
This is a toy car remote.

1180
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,276
Will it work’?

1181
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:40,882
A similar remote was
used in the Boston bombing.

1182
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:45,789
"I'll complain about you."

1183
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:47,292
"I'll trap your finger in the ring."

1184
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,619
What's the range of the remote?

1185
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:50,527
I've installed the battery.

1186
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:54,995
So by tomorrow...it'll work
within a range of 50-60 feet.

1187
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:57,628
And as the battery weakens.

1188
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,763
The closer you're to the mike,
the better.

1189
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:03,810
"Don't use your killer
attitude on me."

1190
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:06,038
"Oh wow!

1191
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:09,878
"You'll do more damage
than good to me."

1192
01:30:09,938 --> 01:30:11,918
"Will you ever make up
for my loses?"

1193
01:30:11,974 --> 01:30:13,976
"Oh wow!

1194
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:14,986
One more thing.

1195
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:17,284
There shouldn't be anything
between the mike and the remote.

1196
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:18,985
Or it won't get the signal.

1197
01:30:20,215 --> 01:30:22,195
"Oh wow!

1198
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:26,055
"Are you going to love me...
at gunpoint."

1199
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:28,625
"Or will you ever
show me your face too.

1200
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:30,659
"Oh wow!"

1201
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,520
Lahore airport has sent
images only till the 8th.

1202
01:30:47,576 --> 01:30:49,146
The one before this.

1203
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:54,059
The injections are in this.

1204
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:55,889
Your new passport.

1205
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,692
I'll call you at 10am.

1206
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:00,665
You'll be on a flight
before anyone finds out.

1207
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:03,627
Take care.

1208
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:12,073
Testing.

1209
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:14,936
Testing. Testing.

1210
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:16,978
Testing. Testing.

1211
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:18,278
Zubaid, is all okay.

1212
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:19,779
This one isn't working.

1213
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:22,082
Testing. Testing.
- Open the mike.

1214
01:31:25,714 --> 01:31:27,193
Where are the images
from 9th and 10th?

1215
01:31:27,249 --> 01:31:28,250
Stop. Stop-

1216
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,724
For God sake send them.

1217
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:41,496
Wait.

1218
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:45,535
It's in the wrong socket.

1219
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,835
Check now.

1220
01:31:47,536 --> 01:31:49,140
Testing. Testing.

1221
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:50,743
It's working.

1222
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,077
Working...
Check the rest.

1223
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:00,251
Is it 5'?

1224
01:32:01,216 --> 01:32:05,631
When I was a kid,
we used to live in Colaba.

1225
01:32:07,055 --> 01:32:10,264
My father, Nauzun Ivlistry.

1226
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:12,966
He was a middle-class man.

1227
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,174
Insurance agent.

1228
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:18,008
But Nadia and l..

1229
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,707
Nadia, my sister.

1230
01:32:21,637 --> 01:32:24,641
He would fulfill all our wishes.

1231
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:29,746
He called us his princesses.

1232
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,857
My little princesses.

1233
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:40,065
When we got good grades,
or won a medal in sports.

1234
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:44,966
..or if we simply hugged him.

1235
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:48,868
Father would take
us out for a treat.

1236
01:32:50,832 --> 01:32:51,776
There.

1237
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:53,568
<i>At the Tag.</i>

1238
01:33:00,842 --> 01:33:04,585
We would all dress up nicely
and go to the Taj tea room.

1239
01:33:05,781 --> 01:33:08,887
Drink tea...along with
chocolate pastries.

1240
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:14,290
Then we grew up...
and it felt awkward.

1241
01:33:14,556 --> 01:33:16,900
..to go outwith papa for pastries.

1242
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:20,267
It just wasn't cool anymore.

1243
01:33:21,797 --> 01:33:23,276
Papa realized this.

1244
01:33:25,033 --> 01:33:28,742
And gradually...our tea
parties at the Taj stopped.

1245
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:40,187
That day...

1246
01:33:44,019 --> 01:33:46,260
<i>When they attacked the Ta}. ....</i>

1247
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:49,691
...set it on fire.

1248
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:55,198
It felt like someone was settling
my childhood memories ablaze.

1249
01:33:57,666 --> 01:34:00,112
They think they will go to Heaven.

1250
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:04,040
These rascals won't even
get a place in hell.

1251
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,557
When we get out of here,

1252
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:17,290
do you know what's the first thing
we should do?

1253
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:22,025
<i>Go to the Ta} and have a cup o? tea.</i>

1254
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,730
With chocolate pastries.

1255
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:34,470
"Why didn't we meet earlier?"

1256
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:41,079
"Why did we burn alone?"

1257
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:50,261
"Together...we're complete."

1258
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:56,701
"Or were we better alone?"

1259
01:34:57,926 --> 01:35:04,901
"My beloved."

1260
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:10,573
"My beloved."

1261
01:35:29,524 --> 01:35:30,901
Shehzad.
- Brother.

1262
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:35,134
Take this money and leave right now.

1263
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:36,197
Now.

1264
01:35:36,464 --> 01:35:38,842
Go away.
Why? And this money.

1265
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:42,780
It's all yours. But please
leave as soon as possible.

1266
01:35:43,138 --> 01:35:44,708
Tell me what's wrong?

1267
01:35:44,773 --> 01:35:46,013
Nothing, my son.

1268
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,587
Just leave. Leave now.

1269
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:52,021
Brother.

1270
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:53,148
Brother.

1271
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:57,695
Sir.

1272
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:58,992
Haider sir.

1273
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:01,556
Sir, he entered
Pakistan on the 10th.

1274
01:36:01,656 --> 01:36:02,760
From Lahore Airport.

1275
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:05,736
Check every hotel,
every guesthouse of the Johar area.

1276
01:36:05,794 --> 01:36:08,104
Talk to every estate agency,
every broker.

1277
01:36:08,663 --> 01:36:11,269
Maybe he rented a place.

1278
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:17,606
Show me your register.

1279
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:46,104
Have you seen this man?
- No, I have not.

1280
01:36:49,771 --> 01:36:52,251
Take a good look.
- No, sir. I have not seen him.

1281
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:01,186
Doctor, I've kept the
injections in the bag.

1282
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:03,996
Did you check them properly? - Yes.

1283
01:37:09,024 --> 01:37:10,970
Thank you.

1284
01:37:18,667 --> 01:37:22,205
I've to go early in the
morning...all because of you.

1285
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,516
Long live.. - l-laaris Saeed!

1286
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:37,222
Long live.. - l-laaris Saeed!

1287
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:41,089
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

1288
01:37:41,122 --> 01:37:44,831
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

1289
01:37:44,893 --> 01:37:47,965
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

1290
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:49,598
We'll meet back here in an hour.

1291
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:51,802
We will leave for
the airport from here.

1292
01:37:51,966 --> 01:37:53,843
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?

1293
01:37:53,902 --> 01:37:54,972
Daniyal.

1294
01:37:55,069 --> 01:37:57,276
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

1295
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,643
Keep the outfit.

1296
01:37:59,007 --> 01:38:00,918
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?

1297
01:38:00,975 --> 01:38:02,045
You're looking nice.

1298
01:38:03,745 --> 01:38:11,129
"Couldn't be mine...
nor could be yours."

1299
01:38:11,186 --> 01:38:18,604
"I couldn't endure
this atrocity of love."

1300
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:25,874
"Couldn't be mine...
nor could be yours."

1301
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:33,148
"I couldn't endure
this atrocity of love."

1302
01:38:34,142 --> 01:38:36,281
Aunty, has the doctor left?

1303
01:38:39,948 --> 01:38:42,622
Has the doctor left?
- Yes, he just did.

1304
01:38:43,017 --> 01:38:44,519
You're early today.

1305
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:45,689
Yeah, the tetanus booster shots..

1306
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:46,788
What are you doing?

1307
01:38:46,855 --> 01:38:49,028
Let me arrange for
the booster shots.

1308
01:38:50,225 --> 01:38:52,227
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1309
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:54,564
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1310
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:56,631
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1311
01:38:56,698 --> 01:38:58,735
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1312
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,802
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1313
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:03,110
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1314
01:39:03,171 --> 01:39:05,173
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1315
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,311
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1316
01:39:07,575 --> 01:39:09,316
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1317
01:39:09,577 --> 01:39:11,579
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1318
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:16,062
Aunty...where did the
second box come from'?

1319
01:39:16,651 --> 01:39:18,130
What box?

1320
01:39:19,587 --> 01:39:20,998
U <i>m</i> bvi sir's medicines.

1321
01:39:22,657 --> 01:39:24,603
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1322
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:26,605
Long live..
- l-laaris Saeed!

1323
01:39:26,661 --> 01:39:29,642
Long live.. - l-laaris Saeed!
- Enough!

1324
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:31,540
Be quiet!

1325
01:39:34,835 --> 01:39:38,248
What's that'?
- It's a toy car...for my son.

1326
01:39:38,506 --> 01:39:39,280
Show me.

1327
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:46,116
Professor Haaris Saeed
sir is amongst us.

1328
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:47,683
Sir, I just bought it.

1329
01:39:48,216 --> 01:39:50,753
If I open this up,
my son won't stop pestering me.

1330
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:54,133
Didn't you hear...show me.

1331
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,998
Or else you won't
get home to your kid.

1332
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:03,943
Please welcome him
with full enthusiasm.

1333
01:40:06,134 --> 01:40:08,205
The doctor must have
bought these. Yes.

1334
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:09,980
But he never does that.

1335
01:40:10,104 --> 01:40:12,584
And I always give him
a list of medicines to buy.

1336
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:14,544
We purchase this medicine
only once a month.

1337
01:40:14,609 --> 01:40:17,317
And I'm the only one who makes an
entry and stocks it in the fridge.

1338
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:19,123
I said I don't know.

1339
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,626
I am not feeling <i>well...</i>
I'm going home.

1340
01:40:21,683 --> 01:40:23,094
What's wrong, aunty?

1341
01:40:23,584 --> 01:40:24,688
Aunty?

1342
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:26,157
Listen up.

1343
01:40:27,589 --> 01:40:29,660
Fine, go on.

1344
01:40:31,759 --> 01:40:33,500
We're with you.

1345
01:40:37,165 --> 01:40:39,611
We've proven to the vvor
d..

1346
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:42,580
..that we Pakistanis
are not afraid.

1347
01:40:42,637 --> 01:40:45,140
..when it comes to upholding Islam.

1348
01:40:45,573 --> 01:40:47,553
Not from that cruel America.

1349
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:50,555
..nor his infidel accomplice India.

1350
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:52,147
What does India want?

1351
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:53,817
Sir, we're checking
hotels in the Johar area.

1352
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,690
Sir...vve just received
a call from Pearl Hotel.

1353
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,694
That's where the bas*** was living.

1354
01:40:56,751 --> 01:40:57,729
He just checked out.

1355
01:40:57,785 --> 01:40:59,992
Circulate his photo all around town.

1356
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:04,161
Every security personnel in Sheikh
sir's rally should have his photo.

1357
01:41:04,826 --> 01:41:07,102
Did you get the right
bottles today, doctor?

1358
01:41:29,584 --> 01:41:33,794
O lndians...come to your
senses...know your place.

1359
01:41:33,855 --> 01:41:36,836
I challenged you before...

1360
01:41:36,891 --> 01:41:40,134
Call me to any court
of law in this world.

1361
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:44,165
And we'll prove who
the real terrorists are.

1362
01:41:56,044 --> 01:41:58,081
Doctor, where are you going?

1363
01:41:58,146 --> 01:42:01,252
Unc
e's waiting for you.
The pain's increasing, come quickly.

1364
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:05,261
I'll answer it later.
- Alright.

1365
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:10,898
You Indians want
action against Pakistan.

1366
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:19,135
Poor lndia...they only express
their motives on television.

1367
01:42:21,569 --> 01:42:24,641
The court has
honorably acquitted me.

1368
01:42:24,706 --> 01:42:27,050
Did you attach a copy
of the delivery receipt?

1369
01:42:30,044 --> 01:42:31,751
Who is it?

1370
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:36,126
If India doesn't want to
settle these problems in the court.

1371
01:42:36,184 --> 01:42:38,596
..then what does India want?

1372
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:44,663
Sabahuddin Umavi.

1373
01:42:44,726 --> 01:42:46,706
Lashkar-e-Taiba's founding member.

1374
01:42:48,763 --> 01:42:50,743
Faster.
Bravo.

1375
01:42:51,132 --> 01:42:56,104
He personally trained Kasab...
and the other nine terrorists.

1376
01:42:58,106 --> 01:42:59,050
Faster.

1377
01:42:59,106 --> 01:43:00,915
Faster. . . like a monkey.

1378
01:43:00,975 --> 01:43:03,888
On 27th November,
Umavi ordered his terrorists.

1379
01:43:03,945 --> 01:43:07,290
<i>“to bum down Oberm and the Ta}.</i>

1380
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:13,789
Where's the doctor?

1381
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:16,062
Greetings, brother.
- Greetings.

1382
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:18,626
I apologies for yesterday.
- It's alright.

1383
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:24,870
Fine...if India says
they want strict actions.

1384
01:43:24,899 --> 01:43:27,641
..then so be it.

1385
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:30,671
He's been pestering for so long.

1386
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,851
Why are you calling continuously?
The doctor's busy.

1387
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:38,049
Stop the doctor.

1388
01:43:38,112 --> 01:43:40,490
Don't let him administer
the injection.

1389
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:45,689
Stop the doctor.

1390
01:43:45,753 --> 01:43:48,097
Just like this
enthusiasm in Lahore..

1391
01:43:48,155 --> 01:43:52,501
..it will grow to
every city in Pakistan.

1392
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,804
This will ruin India
and set Kashmir free.

1393
01:44:02,136 --> 01:44:04,207
What does India think?

1394
01:44:04,272 --> 01:44:05,649
The moment has passed.

1395
01:44:05,673 --> 01:44:07,949
This is the moment for Jihad.

1396
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,826
They play such dirty games.

1397
01:44:14,882 --> 01:44:16,623
What does India want?

1398
01:44:16,784 --> 01:44:18,730
What does India want?

1399
01:44:26,961 --> 01:44:31,967
Our Kashmiri brethren.

1400
01:44:37,538 --> 01:44:41,611
Even America and Russia
couldn't stand against our Jihad.

1401
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:48,151
And by the grace of Allah,
India will fall as well.

1402
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:54,529
Haaris sir...march ahead.
- We're with you.

1403
01:44:55,790 --> 01:45:00,500
Haaris sir...march ahead.
- We're with you.

1404
01:45:32,093 --> 01:45:34,539
What was the jail security doing?

1405
01:45:34,629 --> 01:45:35,937
Rascals!

1406
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:39,577
Seal all exit points
out of the city.

1407
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:41,806
Airports,
land borders, trains, busses!

1408
01:45:41,869 --> 01:45:43,780
Shut down the entire city.

1409
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:45,180
Where's Sheikh sir?

1410
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:47,747
Where's I-l aaris Saeed'?

1411
01:45:47,808 --> 01:45:50,618
Keep calling us terrorists
and we keep quiet.

1412
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:51,687
At the rally.

1413
01:45:51,746 --> 01:45:54,022
Get him out.
Have our men escort him home.

1414
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:54,786
NOW!

1415
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:57,659
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

1416
01:45:57,718 --> 01:45:59,095
And that doctor.
Did he say something?

1417
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:00,598
He wasn't behind it, sir.
- Then?

1418
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:02,531
Someone exchanged the
injections at the clinic.

1419
01:46:02,623 --> 01:46:04,500
They want us to hide in a corner?

1420
01:46:04,592 --> 01:46:06,970
Never! Never!

1421
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:10,839
Listen carefully to
our message to India.

1422
01:46:47,201 --> 01:46:48,236
Quickly.

1423
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:50,078
Hurry UP-

1424
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:51,980
Get the car. Hurry up.

1425
01:47:08,689 --> 01:47:11,295
Move. Move aside.

1426
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,140
Stop.

1427
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:18,575
Stop him!

1428
01:47:24,338 --> 01:47:27,615
Someone's chasing Sheikh
sir's car in a police vehicle.

1429
01:47:27,942 --> 01:47:29,182
Stop him.

1430
01:47:29,644 --> 01:47:31,282
Hurry up,
Sheikh sir's car is coming this way.

1431
01:47:31,545 --> 01:47:32,819
Move the barricades.

1432
01:47:40,254 --> 01:47:41,198
Fire.

1433
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:45,291
Move the bamboos.
Hurry up.

1434
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:53,602
Break it down.

1435
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:06,278
Wait a minute, brother.
- Come soon, dear.

1436
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,842
Move!

1437
01:49:08,976 --> 01:49:10,148
Move!

1438
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:11,587
Wait a minute, brother.

1439
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:13,056
Move!

1440
01:49:17,151 --> 01:49:19,825
Quickly.

1441
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:21,230
Come, dear.

1442
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:22,995
Just a minute.

1443
01:49:28,262 --> 01:49:29,741
Why you...

1444
01:49:31,932 --> 01:49:33,002
Stop.

1445
01:49:39,173 --> 01:49:41,016
Why did you do it, ma'am?

1446
01:49:41,742 --> 01:49:43,050
For Pakistan.

1447
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:44,589
Mefam!

1448
01:51:17,304 --> 01:51:18,977
L-I aaris Saeed.

1449
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:24,854
You keep asking...
what does India want?

1450
01:51:26,914 --> 01:51:29,918
India wants...justice!

1451
01:51:57,011 --> 01:51:58,547
Where's Amina Bi?

1452
01:52:03,784 --> 01:52:04,922
Yes, sir.

1453
01:52:08,122 --> 01:52:09,567
Go...go..

1454
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:17,301
What's your exit plan'?

1455
01:52:17,565 --> 01:52:19,101
It's impossible
to get to the airport?

1456
01:52:19,166 --> 01:52:21,305
Daniyal, they'll close
down the entire city.

1457
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:23,673
Get out of there at any cost.

1458
01:52:27,007 --> 01:52:28,315
I'll call you later, sir.

1459
01:52:28,576 --> 01:52:30,317
Okay, but keep your phone on.

1460
01:52:30,544 --> 01:52:31,147
Fine.

1461
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:36,217
Take your clothes off...
quickly.

1462
01:52:37,585 --> 01:52:38,757
It'll expire soon...
get it renewed.

1463
01:52:38,819 --> 01:52:40,594
Fine.
- Let him through.

1464
01:52:42,856 --> 01:52:44,096
Hey...

1465
01:52:44,157 --> 01:52:45,135
Stop!

1466
01:52:47,828 --> 01:52:49,136
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1467
01:52:55,603 --> 01:52:57,082
Sir, what are you doing?

1468
01:52:57,137 --> 01:52:58,582
Honestly, sir. I swear.

1469
01:52:58,638 --> 01:52:59,946
This man came to my shop alone.

1470
01:53:00,007 --> 01:53:01,645
..to rent my stuff for the wedding.

1471
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:03,187
Who's wedding was it?

1472
01:53:07,648 --> 01:53:08,285
What is it?

1473
01:53:08,549 --> 01:53:09,619
She's in labor.

1474
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:10,856
The pain's excruciating.

1475
01:53:10,918 --> 01:53:12,727
We've to get to the hospital.

1476
01:53:12,786 --> 01:53:14,060
It'll only take a minute,
let me check.

1477
01:53:14,154 --> 01:53:17,897
Rascal...l am dying...
let's go now!

1478
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:19,904
It'll only take a minute,
let me check. Wait...

1479
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,702
Don't you have
a mother you scoundrel.

1480
01:53:22,763 --> 01:53:27,872
If anything happens to my kid...
I won't spare any of you.

1481
01:53:27,935 --> 01:53:30,279
Rascal...get out of here quickly.

1482
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,676
Come on.
Let them through.

1483
01:53:42,850 --> 01:53:43,851
Daniyal.

1484
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:48,963
The Indian border is
only 26 kilometers from here.

1485
01:53:49,022 --> 01:53:50,729
Cover every nook and corner.

1486
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:53,828
Sir, they will seal the
entire border around Lahore.

1487
01:53:53,994 --> 01:53:55,837
Sir, we've some
contacts at Dera Nanak.

1488
01:53:55,896 --> 01:53:58,775
Tell them to drive
towards north from Lahore.

1489
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:01,746
Seal Lalo and Dhilvvan roads too.

1490
01:54:01,802 --> 01:54:03,110
Check every car.

1491
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:05,980
But, sir...they can also
head for the Afghanistan border.

1492
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:07,986
Or...
ran.
- But the borders.

1493
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:10,715
Sir, all the land
borders will be sealed.

1494
01:54:10,778 --> 01:54:13,019
Tell them to drive southwards,
towards Karachi.

1495
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:15,151
But this way they will
be trapped inside Pakistan.

1496
01:54:15,215 --> 01:54:18,162
Sir, Daniyal can come
the same way they did.

1497
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:22,732
From Karachi...in a boat.

1498
01:54:23,757 --> 01:54:26,533
But it'll take us at least
1O hours to get to Karachi.

1499
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:28,163
There is no other way, Daniyal.

1500
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:30,869
It's impossible to cross
any other border of Pakistan.

1501
01:54:31,232 --> 01:54:32,802
He isn't here.

1502
01:54:32,833 --> 01:54:34,642
Let's look at the back.

1503
01:54:34,702 --> 01:54:36,010
After the 26/11 attack.

1504
01:54:36,069 --> 01:54:39,073
..we planted one of our man
at the Ivlanora Jetty petrol pump.

1505
01:54:39,139 --> 01:54:42,609
Sir, that man can
take Daniyal in his boat.

1506
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:48,625
But, sir...
- But what?

1507
01:54:48,682 --> 01:54:51,219
Only till the Pakistani
territorial boater's limit.

1508
01:54:51,485 --> 01:54:53,658
Beyond that...the Pakistani
navy will intercept them.

1509
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:57,224
Sir, I think we should send
our boat to Pakistani waters.

1510
01:54:57,491 --> 01:54:58,663
Even I know that.

1511
01:54:58,725 --> 01:55:00,762
But for that we'll
need Government clearance.

1512
01:55:02,195 --> 01:55:02,935
<i>%‘w,(</i>

1513
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:06,233
This one.

1514
01:55:11,705 --> 01:55:12,843
Sir, that's him.

1515
01:55:13,974 --> 01:55:14,714
What?

1516
01:55:14,842 --> 01:55:17,049
Haaris Saeed and Umavi are dead.
- Yes, sir.

1517
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:19,750
The news reports will be here soon.

1518
01:55:19,813 --> 01:55:25,786
L-low do you know'?
- Sir...our men...l<illed them.

1519
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:29,590
Speak up.

1520
01:55:30,657 --> 01:55:33,763
Sir, brother has a white Suzuki car.

1521
01:55:34,695 --> 01:55:36,072
Number.

1522
01:55:38,932 --> 01:55:44,109
LEA 1901.

1523
01:55:45,072 --> 01:55:48,053
Let me go, I haven't done anything.

1524
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:50,518
I haven't done anything.

1525
01:55:50,577 --> 01:55:51,851
Who gave you the authority?

1526
01:55:51,912 --> 01:55:53,721
It's our responsibility
to get him out of there.

1527
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:56,590
He's one of us.
- No, he's your man.

1528
01:55:56,650 --> 01:55:58,152
You sent him in like Rambo.

1529
01:55:58,218 --> 01:56:01,028
Now get him out yourself...
bloody idiots!

1530
01:56:01,088 --> 01:56:04,069
I must tell the Prime
Minister everything right now.

1531
01:56:04,124 --> 01:56:06,900
But, sir, please listen to me..
- I say get out!

1532
01:56:08,595 --> 01:56:09,164
Yes, sir.

1533
01:56:09,229 --> 01:56:11,607
LEA 1901.
Yes, sir.

1534
01:56:11,665 --> 01:56:12,871
11 am in the morning.

1535
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:15,107
Sir, 11 am.
From Lal Kuan checkpoint.

1536
01:56:15,168 --> 01:56:16,909
Send the car number
to Karachi police.

1537
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:18,506
Let me be blunt, sir.

1538
01:56:18,572 --> 01:56:22,145
Did India assassinate Haaris
Saeed and Sabahuddin Umavi?

1539
01:56:22,209 --> 01:56:23,187
No!

1540
01:56:24,077 --> 01:56:28,025
India has no connection
with their deaths.

1541
01:56:28,515 --> 01:56:31,086
Let me strongly
reiterate at this point..

1542
01:56:31,151 --> 01:56:34,257
..that India does not
believe in vigilante justice.

1543
01:56:34,521 --> 01:56:37,798
The media.
- I have an idea, sir.

1544
01:56:38,892 --> 01:56:40,098
M r. Roy.

1545
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,538
Sir, Daniyal Khan just called.

1546
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:45,906
He says he's going to surrender
himself to the Pakistani government.

1547
01:56:45,966 --> 01:56:49,573
..and admit that the Indian government
is behind both the killings.

1548
01:56:49,637 --> 01:56:51,981
Nonsense!
- Sir, Daniyal has threatened to do so.

1549
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:54,815
He said he'll surrender
in half an hour.

1550
01:56:58,078 --> 01:57:02,220
If your leave's been approved,
why would we object.

1551
01:57:05,853 --> 01:57:06,957
Stop. Stop-

1552
01:57:09,923 --> 01:57:11,197
Sir. Yes, sir.

1553
01:57:11,258 --> 01:57:13,295
I'll wait for your call.

1554
01:57:14,261 --> 01:57:17,105
Prime Minister's office...
is talking to the Navy.

1555
01:57:17,698 --> 01:57:19,302
So...where are you coming from'?

1556
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:21,110
Yes, sir.

1557
01:57:21,168 --> 01:57:24,081
Show me your license.
- Yes.

1558
01:57:24,137 --> 01:57:29,917
LEA...1901.

1559
01:57:31,078 --> 01:57:32,557
Samit.
- Yes, sir.

1560
01:57:32,579 --> 01:57:35,287
There's a navy plane waiting
for you at Palam Air base.

1561
01:57:35,549 --> 01:57:37,961
It will take you
to Western Naval Base.

1562
01:57:39,686 --> 01:57:40,255
Me?

1563
01:57:40,954 --> 01:57:42,558
The licenses made in Lahore.

1564
01:57:42,623 --> 01:57:43,294
Yes.

1565
01:57:43,557 --> 01:57:44,297
Go on.

1566
01:57:44,558 --> 01:57:45,628
Let them through.

1567
01:57:47,027 --> 01:57:48,529
White Suzuki?

1568
01:57:49,029 --> 01:57:50,531
Stop!

1569
01:58:02,008 --> 01:58:04,716
8990!

1570
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:07,952
Fine, go on.

1571
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:10,755
Where are you heading?
- Ivlauripur.

1572
01:58:10,951 --> 01:58:13,056
Take one of our men along.

1573
01:58:13,153 --> 01:58:14,029
Yes.

1574
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,293
Come on, get in.

1575
01:58:17,891 --> 01:58:19,837
Have some shame.
There's a lady inside.

1576
01:58:19,893 --> 01:58:21,099
Sit at the back.

1577
01:58:21,895 --> 01:58:22,965
Get in.

1578
01:58:23,197 --> 01:58:24,107
Sit.

1579
01:58:32,205 --> 01:58:33,684
Go!

1580
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:45,897
You're brave...done be a fool.

1581
01:58:46,253 --> 01:58:47,129
Come on.

1582
01:58:49,089 --> 01:58:49,965
Come on.

1583
01:58:54,928 --> 01:58:55,998
Come, Khalid!

1584
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:30,167
I'll sign this. Keep the rest.

1585
01:59:41,041 --> 01:59:42,111
Open this.

1586
01:59:42,209 --> 01:59:44,086
They're getting away.

1587
01:59:44,144 --> 01:59:45,282
Hurry UP-

1588
01:59:50,284 --> 01:59:52,286
We'll take you across
Pakistani waters.

1589
01:59:52,552 --> 01:59:54,554
And the Indian navy
will pick you up from there.

1590
01:59:54,621 --> 01:59:55,998
My satellite phone is on.

1591
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:59,696
They will know our
location and get to you.

1592
02:00:00,293 --> 02:00:01,704
Thank you.

1593
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:12,144
The car was heading
towards Ivlauripur.

1594
02:00:12,172 --> 02:00:14,709
I think they're heading
towards Ivlanora jetty.

1595
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:16,117
They will get out using a boat.

1596
02:00:16,176 --> 02:00:19,680
Alert Naval command to
stop all boats in this area.

1597
02:00:19,746 --> 02:00:20,816
It will be a big problem, sir.

1598
02:00:20,881 --> 02:00:22,690
Numerous boats leave
from Ivlanora and Ivlauripur.

1599
02:00:22,749 --> 02:00:24,057
I don't care!

1600
02:00:24,818 --> 02:00:28,231
Stop all the boats
sailing in the water.

1601
02:00:28,855 --> 02:00:30,027
Each one!

1602
02:00:30,089 --> 02:00:32,126
Samit!
- Yes, sir.

1603
02:00:34,027 --> 02:00:34,971
Yes.

1604
02:00:35,862 --> 02:00:37,170
That's the boat's position..

1605
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,540
..vvhich we're getting
through their satellite phone.

1606
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:40,202
Okay, sir.

1607
02:00:40,233 --> 02:00:43,077
Within 1O minutes this boat
will enter international waters.

1608
02:00:55,849 --> 02:00:56,884
Pakistan Navy!

1609
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:06,167
Why did it stop?

1610
02:01:10,564 --> 02:01:11,736
Why are you so far
away from the shore?

1611
02:01:11,798 --> 02:01:13,675
We're fishing, sir.

1612
02:01:13,733 --> 02:01:15,007
It's really difficult these days.

1613
02:01:15,068 --> 02:01:16,775
Check now.
- Okay, sir.

1614
02:01:23,677 --> 02:01:24,951
Check at the back.

1615
02:01:29,716 --> 02:01:31,024
Back there too.

1616
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:35,096
Were there any other
boats in front of you?

1617
02:01:35,155 --> 02:01:37,635
Don't know,
sir...there are lots of them here.

1618
02:01:37,691 --> 02:01:39,170
The boat's clear, sir.

1619
02:01:43,529 --> 02:01:45,099
I think they've been stopped.

1620
02:01:45,932 --> 02:01:47,605
Both the boats have stopped.

1621
02:01:52,039 --> 02:01:53,017
Sir.

1622
02:01:53,974 --> 02:01:55,214
Turn the light that way.

1623
02:02:11,958 --> 02:02:13,528
Fire that way in the water.

1624
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:28,184
Dammit.

1625
02:02:28,608 --> 02:02:30,212
The boat is still
in Pakistani waters.

1626
02:02:30,277 --> 02:02:31,813
But we can't go there.

1627
02:02:31,945 --> 02:02:33,015
L-low far is it'?

1628
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:34,487
Not too far.

1629
02:02:34,715 --> 02:02:37,719
But we don't have
orders to go beyond this.

1630
02:02:38,018 --> 02:02:40,089
They'll have to come
into international waters.

1631
02:02:42,555 --> 02:02:43,966
Stop firing.

1632
02:02:44,558 --> 02:02:46,231
Turn the boat towards Karachi.
- But, sir...

1633
02:02:46,493 --> 02:02:47,733
I said turn it around.

1634
02:02:47,794 --> 02:02:49,774
Follow me.
- Fine, sir.

1635
02:02:49,929 --> 02:02:51,237
Show me your navigation charts.

1636
02:02:53,700 --> 02:02:54,735
Get in.

1637
02:03:01,942 --> 02:03:03,250
Wait a minute.

1638
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:06,718
Why are they heading
back to Pakistan?

1639
02:03:24,764 --> 02:03:25,742
We'll have to go back.

1640
02:03:36,876 --> 02:03:37,820
Sir they are right here.

1641
02:03:37,878 --> 02:03:38,652
There.

1642
02:03:38,712 --> 02:03:40,555
DaniyaPs at the exact
location where the boat stopped.

1643
02:03:40,613 --> 02:03:41,591
We just have to go there.

1644
02:03:41,648 --> 02:03:42,922
I am sorry.

1645
02:03:43,049 --> 02:03:45,825
We don't have orders
to enter Pakistani waters.

1646
02:03:45,952 --> 02:03:48,023
Turn us around, we've to go back.

1647
02:03:48,622 --> 02:03:51,159
Sir, we're just 5
minutes away from him.

1648
02:03:51,224 --> 02:03:52,532
We can't leave him behind.

1649
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:55,937
I said we don't have permission
to enter Pakistani waters!

1650
02:03:56,096 --> 02:03:57,575
Turn back!

1651
02:03:58,064 --> 02:03:59,270
No!

1652
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:10,920
Sir...where were you on the
night of 26th November, 2008'?

1653
02:04:12,946 --> 02:04:14,687
Where were you that night.

1654
02:04:14,881 --> 02:04:18,260
..when 1O men humiliated
1 billion Indians.

1655
02:04:22,555 --> 02:04:24,831
Wherever you were, I'm sure..

1656
02:04:24,891 --> 02:04:28,805
..even you felt weak,
helpless and humiliated.

1657
02:04:30,196 --> 02:04:33,575
Your blood must have boi
ed...
ike
mine, like the entire country.

1658
02:04:37,036 --> 02:04:42,952
This man...
whom we're leaving to die..

1659
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:47,250
...he single-handedly
killed all those people.

1660
02:04:48,782 --> 02:04:51,763
..who brought India
to its knees that day.

1661
02:04:55,622 --> 02:04:59,593
Sir, if we can't
save this man today.

1662
02:05:02,529 --> 02:05:08,741
..then what's the point
of this technology, this power?

1663
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:11,708
It's all useless!

1664
02:05:26,919 --> 02:05:29,559
I think we won't have
that tea at the Taj.

1665
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:31,828
No!

1666
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:35,465
I'll have tea with you.

1667
02:05:37,129 --> 02:05:39,837
Even if we have to swim all
the way to Mumbai.

1668
02:05:46,072 --> 02:05:48,177
Okay then, Navvaz Ivlistry...

1669
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:53,652
...have a cup for me as well.

1670
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:14,980
"A traveler of the night."

1671
02:06:16,669 --> 02:06:24,884
"Says goodbye in the morning."

1672
02:06:26,746 --> 02:06:35,564
"l couldn't be yours
while I was still alive."

1673
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:45,767
"But carried out
his duty while dying."

1674
02:06:46,299 --> 02:06:51,299
"Couldn't be yours...nor
could be yours."

1675
02:06:57,143 --> 02:07:02,143
"I couldn't endure
this atrocity of love."

1676
02:09:32,699 --> 02:09:35,043
Do you know why I
agreed to this mission?

1677
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:44,645
Because I want to see the same respect
in Dilavvar Singh's eyes for me.

1678
02:09:49,649 --> 02:09:51,686
I want him to salute me again.

1679
02:09:55,254 --> 02:09:58,531
With the same enthusiasm...
the same passion.

1680
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:05,131
Ma'am, we're here to
escort you to the base.

1681
02:10:11,271 --> 02:10:14,275
Can you take me somewhere else?

1682
02:10:27,053 --> 02:10:31,593
This is the same place that
was attacked on 26/11..

1683
02:10:31,657 --> 02:10:33,659
People have gathered here
today in thousands

1684
02:10:33,726 --> 02:10:37,606
First morning after the
masterminds of 26/11 were killed.

1685
02:10:37,664 --> 02:10:38,802
Around here are
the people of lvlumbaL.

1686
02:10:38,865 --> 02:10:40,208
..who are here to pay
condolence to the victims.

1687
02:10:40,266 --> 02:10:42,542
People from all over the
city are gathering around here..

1688
02:10:42,601 --> 02:10:44,740
..to express their happiness.

1689
02:10:44,804 --> 02:10:46,044
L-low do you feel'?

1690
02:10:46,105 --> 02:10:48,142
God has given us justice.

1691
02:10:48,207 --> 02:10:50,847
But we shou
d've
killed those murderers.

1692
02:11:18,070 --> 02:11:19,913
Here's a cup tea, dear?

1693
02:11:22,308 --> 02:11:23,719
But I don't have money.

1694
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:25,153
It's alright.

1695
02:11:25,277 --> 02:11:27,655
I am not charging anyone today.

1696
02:11:27,747 --> 02:11:28,725
Take it.

1697
02:11:35,221 --> 02:11:39,192
My son worked at
the Taj as a waiter.

1698
02:11:40,059 --> 02:11:43,040
That night they killed him too.

1699
02:11:44,063 --> 02:11:47,943
Today when I learned that those
murderers have been killed...

1700
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:53,507
..it felt like my son's
soul attained peace.

1701
02:11:53,839 --> 02:11:56,615
So I won't charge anyone today.
Yes.

1702
02:12:00,179 --> 02:12:02,159
Uncle.
- Yes.

1703
02:12:03,216 --> 02:12:04,627
Can I get another cup of tea?

1704
02:12:04,684 --> 02:12:06,630
Of course.

1705
02:12:07,086 --> 02:12:08,622
Here.

1706
02:12:08,921 --> 02:12:10,229
Thank you.
