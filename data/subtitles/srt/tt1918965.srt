1
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:54,804
''l hope this night comes to a halt.''

2
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:58,720
''l hope the conversation stops.''

3
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:02,762
''ln your arms.''

4
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,846
''Desires have aroused
on the thirsty lips.''

5
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:18,264
''l want to burn
myself in your desires.''

6
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:25,597
''Come and embrace me today.''

7
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:30,347
''Who knows what will
happen tomorrow?''

8
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,887
''Come a little closer.''

9
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:37,680
''We have fortunately
got these moments.''

10
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:41,598
''Come a little closer.''

11
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,263
''We have fortunately
got these moments.''

12
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:49,263
''Let's live them.''

13
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:07,683
''Forgetting this world..''

14
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:15,559
''..let's be with
each other all night.''

15
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:23,350
''We are companions for
a few moments.''

16
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,641
''Both of us are here now..''

17
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:30,266
''..but we don't know where
we might be in the morning.''

18
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:37,726
''Come and engross yourself in me.''

19
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:42,726
''Who knows what will
happen tomorrow?''

20
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:46,265
''Come a little closer.''

21
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,183
''We have fortunately
got these moments.''

22
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:54,227
''Come a little closer.''

23
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,475
''We have fortunately
got these moments.''

24
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,935
''Come.''

25
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:05,268
''We have fortunately
got these moments.''

26
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,475
''Let's live them.''

27
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:12,517
''l hope this night comes to a halt.''

28
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:16,392
''ln your arms.''

29
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:40,604
Hello.

30
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,604
Merry Christmas.

31
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:49,855
lt's good that you put
marble on your family's grave.

32
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:53,437
Yes. But it's futile.

33
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,562
People would walk over it.

34
00:05:56,854 --> 00:06:00,520
People have no
respect for living or dead.

35
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,563
No respect.

36
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,563
Yes, Daniel. Tell me.
- Boss.

37
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:10,562
Did you get the parcel?
- The foreigner is being fussy.

38
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,438
He is not paying. There
seems to be a problem.

39
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:14,604
All right. l am coming.

40
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,814
What are you doing?

41
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,273
Tell him what l am saying.

42
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:35,440
No, Arjun. Arjun, do you
want to kill him?

43
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:36,731
Tell this idiot..
- Arjun, let go of him.

44
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:39,357
That he is a scoundrel.

45
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,523
He shouldn't mess with me. He
shouldn't try to usurp my goods.

46
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:45,813
Or else people will say that
there used to be a scoundrel.

47
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,607
Because l will kill him.

48
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,856
l will kick him out of
this country in such a way..

49
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,858
..that he won't even think
about coming back to this country.

50
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,274
Tell him!

51
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,149
Thank you.

52
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:05,859
Super. Super. Amazing. Amazing.

53
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,776
Very good. Very good.

54
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:10,859
Wow! What a scene.

55
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:14,859
Why don't you try
acting in Hindi films?

56
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:18,942
Because l charge a lot.
lt's not easy to afford me.

57
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:21,442
Who knows that better than me?

58
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,525
Then talk to the point and leave.

59
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,610
Hey, hero. Don't try
to act smart with me.

60
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:30,610
Or else l pop your eyes out
and stitch them to your shirt.

61
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:33,317
l know that your father had
a shop in a red light area.

62
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,441
He would stitch blouses
for girls for Rs. 20 each.

63
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,399
Are you trying to be funny?

64
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,609
Can we come to the point?
- This one.

65
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,568
This one.

66
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:46,151
See this.

67
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:47,818
lt's been 20 days.

68
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:51,651
And see this one. This
girl's name is Jyoti.

69
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:54,611
She had gone to a man yesterday,
but hasn't come back yet.

70
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:56,693
There's no news of anyone.

71
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:00,609
And seeing these people, even
the other girls are refusing to go.

72
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,153
Someone has cast an evil eye.

73
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:04,195
Someone has cast an
evil eye on my business.

74
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:07,153
That too during these days.
During holidays.

75
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,694
Christmas and New Year.

76
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:12,778
When girls are highly demanded,
they are not ready to go.

77
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:16,485
So, your girls are
disappearing one by one. - Yes.

78
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,568
And you want me to find them.
- Yes.

79
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:22,152
And also the man who is
kidnapping them. - Absolutely.

80
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:25,362
l had called for eight girls
from Mumbai a few days back.

81
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,363
Four of them have gone missing.

82
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:30,778
But your hired
henchmen can also do this.

83
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:34,736
Then why me?
- You are a working policeman.

84
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,362
You work even during holidays.

85
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:39,571
You make money.

86
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,613
lt's my necessity to work
during the last days of the year.

87
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:45,904
You won't understand.

88
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:49,488
And l am not a policeman. l was.

89
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:50,903
Ex-cop.

90
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,196
How does that matter?

91
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,197
You have just lost yourjob.

92
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,695
But the policeman
within you still exists.

93
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,404
There are many people within me.

94
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:03,614
l do all the bad things in the
world besides dealing in women.

95
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,278
Anyway, did you lodge a
complaint with the police?

96
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,821
Do you want to get me in trouble?

97
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:12,403
lf l had to take their help,
then why would l call you here?

98
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:14,780
What if they frame me?

99
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,738
All right. Pay me Rs.
200000 in advance.

100
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:20,238
Rs. 300000 after the work is done.

101
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:23,279
Give me some discount, brother.

102
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,739
lt's Christmas time. l
am in a lot of demand.

103
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:29,363
And anyway, if there's
anything more important than God..

104
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:31,197
..then that's wealth and money..

105
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,780
..and not a certificate of honesty.

106
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,947
Tell me if you agree, or else..

107
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:37,447
Or else you go your way
and l go mine.

108
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:39,239
l know. l know.

109
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:42,906
Yes, boss?
- Give it to him.

110
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,156
He is a useful man.

111
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,782
Ask and you shall receive.

112
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:21,324
lf you ask for it, you will get it.

113
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:23,530
lf you look for it,
you will find it.

114
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:28,572
lf you knock on the door,
it will open for you.

115
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:33,240
No, Mother. lf God is
not with the orphan kids..

116
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,241
..then it's better that
He's not with me either.

117
00:10:39,283 --> 00:10:40,574
For the kids.

118
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:46,781
Arjun, God takes, but He also gives.

119
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,449
He has given you this life.

120
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:53,741
He helped you so that
you can help someone.

121
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:58,284
Don't you know how He
uses you to help others?

122
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,659
Make peace with Him, my child.

123
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,617
lt's been 20 years
since that happened.

124
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:09,660
No, Mother. l can
never forget this day.

125
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,742
The relationship
between God and me is over.

126
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:14,618
And there's no question of peace.

127
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:16,408
Because l am not going
to forgive Him.

128
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:18,200
You are impossible.

129
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:21,703
Whenever you talk,
you talk negatively.

130
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,576
Not interested.

131
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,659
Now something can happen only
when God comes to me Himself..

132
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:28,744
..and repairs my life.

133
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:31,286
Until then, He goes
His way and l go mine.

134
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:53,418
Yes, Daniel. Did you
get the other parcel?

135
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:55,459
No, boss. Not yet.
- Okay. l am coming.

136
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,417
That's it?

137
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:07,167
You got what you wanted?

138
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:10,753
You did what you wanted to and left.

139
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:15,252
Of course. Do you eat food at a
hotel and then keep sitting there?

140
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:16,752
No, right?

141
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,669
This is how it should be.

142
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:24,420
Take this. Buy a new
AC and TV for yourself.

143
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,628
l don't want your money.

144
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,210
l can take care of myself.

145
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,378
Take it.

146
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,253
Or else l won't show you my face.

147
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,878
You will yearn for me and l won't
even turn around and look at you.

148
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,587
Emotional blackmail?

149
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:54,212
Call it whatever you
want to. l don't care.

150
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,669
You go your way and l go mine.

151
00:15:57,962 --> 00:16:00,170
My way is your way.

152
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,336
Tell me something.

153
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:04,587
lt's been three years.

154
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:10,295
l don't understand whether l
am your love or your need.

155
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:13,921
My habit.

156
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:16,294
Nothing else.

157
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,587
l can't take care of myself.

158
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:23,504
Why should l take up
your responsibility?

159
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:25,921
Because l am like you too.

160
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,298
Destroyed.

161
00:16:29,463 --> 00:16:30,756
When two destroyed people meet..

162
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,590
..they take care of each other.

163
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:35,213
Or fall in a pit together.

164
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:38,422
Your work is going on so well.

165
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:41,298
You get half-naked
pictures clicked and make money.

166
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:42,714
Earn money and have fun.

167
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:44,838
Or marry a rich man.

168
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,383
lf you depend on me, you will repent.

169
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:53,796
Perhaps, l might usurp your money.

170
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,881
Usurp it. l don't care.

171
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:04,923
But for that, you
will have to be with me.

172
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:07,715
This life is better.

173
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:10,341
Friendship from a distance.

174
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:14,675
And anyway, l don't have
fun for free.

175
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,298
Thanks.

176
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:23,173
lt's still where we began from.

177
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:29,882
lt never began that it
would reach to a conclusion.

178
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:33,922
That's why enjoy if you want to.

179
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:36,549
lf you want a family, then get
it published in the newspaper.

180
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,760
All right. l'll think about it.

181
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:52,217
But come in the evening if you can.

182
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,341
lt's Christmas Eve.

183
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,633
And this year, l want to
celebrate it only with you.

184
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:05,425
Yes. Tell me.
- Boss, Jyoti's taxi has been found.

185
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,717
Where are you?
- Near Mozim Cross.

186
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,759
Sir, Jyoti got down over here.

187
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:11,885
Then a car came from here.

188
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:15,593
..and stopped right here
where your car has pulled up.

189
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:19,635
The driver honked and she
sat in the car and left.

190
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,466
She said she would be
back in an hour.

191
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:28,426
Yes sir. She forgot
her mobile in haste.

192
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,885
Do you remember the driver's
face or the number of the car?

193
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:34,176
No sir. l didn't see properly.

194
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,387
Look, the police is investigating..

195
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,597
..Ana Safin disappearance.

196
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,928
'State's best
officers are carrying out..'

197
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,261
'..this joint operation
with the Russian Embassy.'

198
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:50,513
'We will solve this case very soon.'

199
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,428
'There is nothing to worry.'

200
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:56,681
'And let me assure that
every foreign tourist..'

201
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,930
'..visiting Goa is being
given tight security.'

202
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:01,305
'Absolutely, the best
arrangements have been made.'

203
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,807
'So there is nothing to worry.'

204
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,221
'l am telling you that we
will have a very great season.'

205
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,471
'Wish you a merry Christmas
and an ever happier new year.'

206
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:08,346
'Thank you so much.'

207
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:10,639
Goat.
- Yes. Scapegoat.

208
00:20:10,846 --> 00:20:13,929
Just as a goat is used as
a bait to attract a lion..

209
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:18,223
..we will have to use your call
girls to catch this man of yours.

210
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:22,263
And l feel this is not the
case ofjust your girls.

211
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,222
This is a case of human trafficking.

212
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,430
But why should l take
such a big risk?

213
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,807
l might lose a few
more girls in the bargain.

214
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,639
And why should my girls
get involved in this mess?

215
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:33,765
They follow the same
principle that l follow.

216
00:20:33,972 --> 00:20:36,305
Pay extra money and get
the job done.

217
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:37,765
And you don't need to say much.

218
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:39,847
Just ask them to text
you the number..

219
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,182
..and address of the
house or hotel they go to.

220
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,599
l will handle the rest.

221
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:46,224
You have a twisted mind.
But you can think well.

222
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:48,348
That is a great idea.

223
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,765
Hey! Get the punching bag.

224
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,390
Hurry up.

225
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:54,472
Here you go.

226
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,223
Come on. Come on.

227
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:59,224
And this as well.

228
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:04,350
What is this for?
- From my side. As a reward.

229
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:06,681
Because you have
given a very good idea.

230
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:08,266
Keep it with you.

231
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:11,639
But tell me something.
- Yes.

232
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:16,433
What is the guarantee that
this man will call up again?

233
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:21,932
Only you have the stock of the
most beautiful girls in Goa.

234
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,432
He will call for certain.

235
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:33,474
Somebody please help me.

236
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:38,268
Somebody please help me.

237
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,643
Help me!

238
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:50,392
Help! Help!

239
00:21:56,477 --> 00:21:57,976
Brother. Brother.
- Yes. Go on.

240
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,477
The customer is calling.
Whom do l send?

241
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:03,643
Send the new girl Reshma
who was brought in yesterday.

242
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,810
Hello.
- Hello sister.

243
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:24,434
Mother still doesn't know
how t to call from a PCO.

244
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:27,435
Give it to me. Give it to me. Move.
- l also want to sister.

245
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:31,519
Hello.
- Reshma.

246
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:33,895
Aaliya and Shaheen. At this time?

247
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,435
Didn't the two of them go to school?

248
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,685
The flowers got withered this month.
So l couldn't sell them.

249
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,310
So couldn't play their fees.

250
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:43,476
But listen, l had sent your money.

251
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,270
Now forget all this.

252
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:49,561
Reshma, tell me.

253
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,936
Are you are absolutely fine?

254
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:55,809
Nothing is going to
happen to me, mother.

255
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:57,893
l am absolutely fine.

256
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,934
Why?

257
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:02,977
l had a weird dream today.

258
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,809
You were calling out to me.

259
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:06,726
Mother, where are you?

260
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,435
Mother, where are you?

261
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:11,269
l was standing right
in front of you.

262
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:14,645
But you were not looking at me.

263
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:17,855
They you just disappeared.

264
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,770
And l kept looking
for you here and there.

265
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:25,229
l couldn't find you anywhere.

266
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,771
Then l woke up.

267
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:32,314
Are you okay?

268
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:34,937
l am absolutely fine, mother.

269
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,689
And l have found a very good job.

270
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:41,771
l have to work forjust 4-5 hours.

271
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:44,397
And the salary is great.

272
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,813
l have sent you there to study.

273
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,314
You are not taking up
any job or anything.

274
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,939
The job is nice, mother.

275
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:54,938
And the salary too is very good.

276
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:58,397
And your worry will
also be done away with.

277
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,481
Don't worry, mother.

278
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,773
Everything will be alright now.

279
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:06,856
l will earn lots of money.

280
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:09,440
For you. For my sisters.

281
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:14,438
And you bet. We will send both
of them to a really nice school.

282
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:16,314
We will get them good education.

283
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:17,523
Right mother?

''You would be with me every evening.''

302
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:57,443
''My heart would cry silently.''

303
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:03,442
''You would be with me every evening.''

304
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:09,610
''l feel l can't live
without you anymore.''

305
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:17,192
''l feel like watching you every day.''

l am a woman after all.

307
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:47,697
l can't help but ask you.

308
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:59,613
Love or necessity?

309

Want.

310
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:05,281
Nothing else.

311
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:08,905
You could've lied on
this day at least.

312
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:11,862
Priya, getting used to a
person is also a fact.

313
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:19,446
Yes. lf that person is a good habit.

314
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:34,531
''l would pour my heart to you.''

''And l would

Why did you look away with

320
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:38,198
Were you jealous?
- Maybe.

Can't help it. l am a man after all.

322
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,825
''You are my shinning star.''

323

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,411
Come on.

335
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:17,371
Neither does he call me nor do l.

336

''How long do l use
dreams as a support?''

337
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:31,288
''Come to me at least
now for God's sake.''

''These two crazy eyes of mine

339
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:48,496
''How do l explain to them?''

340

''l can't control them.''

341
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:58,497
''l would pour my heart to you.''

00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:06,497
''lf l could tell you

''..l spend with you from time.''

Hey! l love you.

Yes. Tell me.

535
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:02,001
What did you do with the girls?
- He has gone crazy.

536
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,336
What did you do with the girls?
- Sit in the car.

537
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,875
Come on.

538
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:07,419
Come on.

539
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:08,670
Come on.

540
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:13,378
Carefully.

541
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,294
Come on. Sit here.

542
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:19,627
You fight on the road.
Sir is coming.

543
00:51:24,669 --> 00:51:26,044
Yes, sir.

544
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:42,544
What, hero?

545
00:51:47,962 --> 00:51:51,377
Your face shows..

546
00:51:52,004 --> 00:51:55,295
..that a woman has
slapped you very hard.

547
00:51:55,588 --> 00:51:56,837
Right?

548
00:51:57,837 --> 00:51:59,711
Yes. Your wife slapped me.

549
00:52:00,337 --> 00:52:01,837
l didn't sleep with her last night.

550
00:52:02,629 --> 00:52:03,794
She was infuriated.

551
00:52:04,878 --> 00:52:06,713
Scoundrel.

552
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,672
Don't take my wife's name.

553
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:10,297
No wife.

554
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,422
What charge did you
press against him?

555
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,922
He thrashed a man on the road.

556
00:52:18,548 --> 00:52:20,922
Tarzan.
- John, don't act too smugly.

557
00:52:21,298 --> 00:52:23,755
He is kidnapping Sameer's call girls.

558
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,298
Four girls have disappeared.

559
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:27,255
Ask him where he
lives and what did he do.

560
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:28,632
Not he.

561
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,006
But you did it.

562
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:33,423
Why do you blame a
decent man needlessly?

563
00:52:33,548 --> 00:52:34,798
You think he is decent?

564
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:35,965
You think he is decent?

565
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:37,922
What else? Are you decent?

566
00:52:38,048 --> 00:52:40,508
Tell me. Are you decent?

567
00:52:41,715 --> 00:52:44,673
You left police's job and
you became a drug peddler.

568
00:52:45,005 --> 00:52:46,922
You work with goons.

569
00:52:47,048 --> 00:52:49,007
You work for pimps.

570
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:52,881
l hate men like you. l hate them.

571
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:55,007
l am also not craving for
your love. Did you understand?

572
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,549
Ask him what he is
doing to the girls.

573
00:52:57,715 --> 00:53:00,256
l will ask him whatever
l have to ask. ln my way.

574
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:01,675
You just shut up.

575
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:04,506
Hey, hero.

576
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:06,716
Write down.

577
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:11,591
Write down what he did with you.

578
00:53:12,424 --> 00:53:13,757
l will put him behind bars.

579
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:17,422
l..

580
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:19,590
l..
- What?

581
00:53:20,547 --> 00:53:22,049
Your address. Your phone number.

582
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:23,507
Write down everything.

583
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:28,382
Sir, l don't remember my address.

584
00:53:28,507 --> 00:53:29,674
What?

585
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:35,341
l have brain tumor. So..

586
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:39,383
My memory is weak.

587
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:43,675
Okay.

588
00:53:44,548 --> 00:53:47,802
What special ailment do you have?

589
00:53:48,299 --> 00:53:50,759
That you don't remember
your address.

590
00:53:50,885 --> 00:53:53,299
Hit him a few times. He
will remember everything.

591
00:53:53,383 --> 00:53:54,801
Sir.
- l will hit you as well.

592
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,382
After some time.

593
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:57,968
Sir.
- What happened?

594
00:53:58,341 --> 00:53:59,718
These are his car's papers.

595
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:01,508
l found it next to the chemist.

596
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:08,426
Whose car is it?

597
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:09,844
Yours?

598
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:11,676
No, sir.

599
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:14,719
lt's my uncle's car.

600
00:54:14,842 --> 00:54:16,300
What's your uncle's name?

601
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,383
He had a nice name.

602
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:27,345
But l don't remember it right now.

603
00:54:29,926 --> 00:54:33,009
But l have a diary.

604
00:54:35,344 --> 00:54:36,967
l have written his name in it.

605
00:54:37,343 --> 00:54:39,008
But that diary is in my house.

606
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:42,009
Your uncle's name is in the diary.

607
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:45,011
The diary is at home.

608
00:54:45,884 --> 00:54:49,677
And you don't know your address.

609
00:54:54,552 --> 00:54:56,260
Hero.

610
00:54:56,551 --> 00:54:57,885
Tell me.

611
00:54:58,552 --> 00:54:59,926
Whose car is it?

612
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,426
Sir, l told you just now.
lt's my uncle's car.

613
00:55:02,552 --> 00:55:03,928
Mr. Amit Yadav.

614
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:05,718
Yadav.

615
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,885
Butjust now you said you
don't remember his name.

616
00:55:11,428 --> 00:55:12,761
No, sir.

617
00:55:13,927 --> 00:55:15,886
l said it's my uncle's car.

618
00:55:17,636 --> 00:55:18,804

619
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:21,385
l..

620
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,011
l don't know what has
happened to me.

621
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,472
Okay.

622
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:39,928
What did you do with Sameer's girls?

623
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:41,804
Who is Sameer, sir?

624
00:55:43,763 --> 00:55:45,430
Where did you sell them?

625
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:47,264
Where did you sell them?

626
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,514
Sir, l don't know Sameer. So..

627
00:55:51,303 --> 00:55:52,596
What did l sell, sir?

628
00:55:52,722 --> 00:55:54,597
Did you sell or not?

629
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:57,805
No, sir. l didn't sell.

630
00:55:59,512 --> 00:56:00,888
l didn't sell, sir.

631
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:05,680
l hacked and threw them away.

632
00:56:12,888 --> 00:56:15,598
What? He cut it?
- Yes, sir.

633
00:56:15,888 --> 00:56:17,473
He must be drunk. Ask him again.

634
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:20,055
No, sir. He confessed it
himself in front of Mr. John.

635
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:21,889
ls it?
- Yes, sir.

636
00:56:22,014 --> 00:56:24,640
Back off. Kadam,
tell them to back off.

637
00:56:24,723 --> 00:56:26,599
Sir, tell us. Please tell us.
- Back off.

638
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:28,723
We want clarity.

639
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:31,390
What happened, sir?

640
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:34,974
lt was Shinde's call.
Arjun is in the lockup.

641
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,598
Tilak, do you remember?

642
00:56:37,723 --> 00:56:40,725
We found the dead bodies
of four girls a year ago.

643
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,891
Someone's hand,
someone's leg or some other part.

644
00:56:43,016 --> 00:56:44,641
You will have to tell us.
You will have to tell us.

645
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:46,349
Which one, sir?

646
00:56:46,433 --> 00:56:47,891
ls this the Vasco case?

647
00:56:48,557 --> 00:56:50,349
But sir, that case was shut.

648
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:53,724
lt was shut. But it wasn't solved.
- Right, sir.

649
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:56,350
l want the file of the Vasco case.
- Okay, sir.

650
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:58,307
Come on.

651
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:17,974
What are you doing?

652
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:19,852
What do you think?

653
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,392
This girl is that boy's partner.

654
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:27,932
Don't you understand partner?
Girlfriend.

655
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:34,766
lf he sees it, then
you'll be in trouble.

656
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,266
John, don't waste time.
Come on. Open the lock.

657
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:57,768
Why? Will your earnings stop
if you stay here for a night?

658
00:57:57,894 --> 00:58:00,517
Are you jealous of my earnings?

659
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,767
You too are no less than a dealer.
Did you understand?

660
00:58:04,018 --> 00:58:05,685
You take bribes under-the-table.

661
00:58:05,768 --> 00:58:07,560
You take bribes from
the dealers of girls.

662
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:09,018
What's the difference
between you and them?

663
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:10,977
What did you call me?
You called me a pimp?

664
00:58:11,061 --> 00:58:13,350
Did it make you furious?
- You scoundrel!

665
00:58:13,476 --> 00:58:14,894
l will teach you a lesson!
- Sir. Sir.

666
00:58:15,017 --> 00:58:19,309
You abused me! l won't spare you!
You called me a pimp!

667
00:58:19,393 --> 00:58:20,727
l won't spare you!

668
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:22,726
John, what is going on?
What is going on?

669
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,310
Arjun, let go of him. Let go of him.

670
00:58:25,393 --> 00:58:27,018
What the hell is happening here?

671
00:58:27,894 --> 00:58:30,394
ls this a police station or
a boxing ring? - Sorry, sir.

672
00:58:30,684 --> 00:58:32,434
Come on. Come out.

673
00:58:33,853 --> 00:58:35,018
Oh.

674
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:40,311
So, you are here too.
Officer Arjun Bhaagwat.

675
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,517
Come. You also come.

676
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,518
You quit the police job,
but you didn't spare us.

677
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:51,395
Who is Dheeraj Pandey?

678
00:58:57,895 --> 00:58:59,313
Sada.

679
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:03,397
Sir.

680
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,729
What do you think?

681
00:59:05,062 --> 00:59:08,520
Nothing yet, sir.
But he has confessed.

682
00:59:08,729 --> 00:59:09,978
Use his confession.

683
00:59:10,062 --> 00:59:11,979
Gather evidence against him.
- Yes, sir.

684
00:59:12,063 --> 00:59:13,562
But remember something.

685
00:59:13,855 --> 00:59:15,812
Keep this news away from
the media and the public.

686
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,688
Do you understand?

687
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,562
But sir, this man is confessing
it himself. This is big news.

688
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:25,771
l know, Sada. But what can l do?

689
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:27,937
l have got the
orders from my seniors..

690
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:30,771
..to conceal this news
of the missing girls.

691
00:59:30,936 --> 00:59:32,521
Moreover, this serial killer.

692
00:59:32,895 --> 00:59:36,521
lf this news is leaked, then
both of us will lose ourjobs.

693
00:59:36,937 --> 00:59:38,480
We have no choice, Sada.

694
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:41,897
We will work on this case,
but on the sly.

695
00:59:42,522 --> 00:59:45,730
That too after Christmas
and New Year's. All right?

696
00:59:47,773 --> 00:59:50,438
Yes, dear. Yes. l have left.

697
00:59:50,563 --> 00:59:52,395
Yes, the party is at 1 1 o'clock.
- Right, sir.

698
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:53,813
The party is at 1 1 o'clock.
l will be there.

699
00:59:53,897 --> 00:59:55,397
On the way. Okay.

700
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,565
l am telling you. He
threw the phone on the road..

701
00:59:57,688 --> 00:59:58,772
..and ran away on seeing me.

702
00:59:58,897 --> 01:00:00,815
Who won't run away on seeing you?

703
01:00:00,896 --> 01:00:02,730
You are a hooligan.

704
01:00:02,855 --> 01:00:05,771
A man like you should be
beaten up with shoes on the road.

705
01:00:05,896 --> 01:00:07,563
Beat me. Beat me.
- Arjun.

706
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:09,314
Beat me.
- Arjun, come on. - Beat me.

707
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,732
Arjun.
- You lock him up.

708
01:00:10,855 --> 01:00:12,524
Scoundrel.
- He is talking nonsense.

709
01:00:12,607 --> 01:00:15,398
Listen to me.
- You don't know him. - Listen!

710
01:00:15,523 --> 01:00:18,272
Do you want to go to prison? Should
l pour cold water on your head?

711
01:00:18,397 --> 01:00:20,564
He is acting and fooling
everyone for the last three hours.

712
01:00:20,691 --> 01:00:23,566
Please. Listen to me. Please.

713
01:00:25,523 --> 01:00:28,399
Go and find Pandey. Look
for him wherever you want to.

714
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:31,315
l give you the permission.
Wear the uniform for a night.

715
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:34,067
Become the same officer.
Arjun Bhaagwat.

716
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:35,650
No.

717
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:38,359
Because these people
who are sitting inside..

718
01:00:38,441 --> 01:00:40,899
..only want to save
their reputation.

719
01:00:41,401 --> 01:00:42,859
No one will do anything
until Christmas and New Year.

720
01:00:42,942 --> 01:00:45,359
Only you can do something. Only you.

721
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:49,693
Just don't make noise.

722
01:00:52,525 --> 01:00:54,735
Did you understand?
- ''My heart is thirsty.''

723
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,360
Did you understand?

724
01:00:59,484 --> 01:01:04,401
''Your body seems like a cloud to me.''

725
01:01:05,899 --> 01:01:12,526
''Pour yourself on me.''

726
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,735
''You are my..''
- Hey, Dheeraj Pandey.

727
01:01:17,694 --> 01:01:19,985
l've heard that you
murdered seven women.

728
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,694
Yes, sir.
- Why?

729
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,860
Why did you murderjust women?

730
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:30,819
l feel like killing them.
So, l kill them.

731
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:36,527
Do you kill only call
girls or the others too?

732
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:41,568
l kill any woman.

733
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:48,943
Clean or tainted. Big or small.

734
01:01:50,694 --> 01:01:52,442
A prostitute or a decent woman.

735
01:01:53,484 --> 01:01:55,861
Anyone, sir. Anyone.

736
01:01:55,944 --> 01:01:59,650
Why weren't you caught till today?

737
01:01:59,986 --> 01:02:01,651
What do l tell you, sir?

738
01:02:03,443 --> 01:02:05,567
The police didn't find
any evidence till today.

739
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:08,819
So..
- How?

740
01:02:08,903 --> 01:02:14,862
Sir, the fun of killing someone
and getting away is different.

741
01:02:17,903 --> 01:02:20,779
No one can arrest me.

742
01:02:20,902 --> 01:02:26,652
What do you do with the
corpses of the people that you kill?

743
01:02:26,738 --> 01:02:28,486
The corpses..

744
01:02:30,487 --> 01:02:35,527
l cut them into small pieces
with the knife and throw them.

745
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:36,862
What else can l do? Tell me.

746
01:02:36,945 --> 01:02:39,819
l throw them in a gutter
or bury them in the ground.

747
01:02:40,402 --> 01:02:42,612
Someone's hand in some
place and leg in the other.

748
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:44,362
The head somewhere else.

749
01:02:44,446 --> 01:02:45,820
The skin of the head
in some other place.

750
01:02:45,904 --> 01:02:47,489
But l must say, sir.

751
01:02:48,487 --> 01:02:52,278
You need a lot of
strength to cut the body.

752
01:02:53,945 --> 01:02:55,528
But it feels good.

753
01:02:58,697 --> 01:03:00,737
Once you practice well, sir..

754
01:03:06,404 --> 01:03:07,530
Yes, boss.

755
01:03:07,947 --> 01:03:10,696
This is Jyoti and this is Sheena.

756
01:03:12,614 --> 01:03:13,779
But who of these is Reshma?

757
01:03:13,904 --> 01:03:16,029
We don't have her photo, boss.
- Why?

758
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:17,654
Because she joined just yesterday.

759
01:03:17,737 --> 01:03:19,615
She is a college student.
She stays at a hostel.

760
01:03:19,738 --> 01:03:21,447
And she has gone for the
first time today, boss.

761
01:03:21,572 --> 01:03:22,988
She is not regular.

762
01:03:30,363 --> 01:03:31,821
This is her room.

763
01:03:32,698 --> 01:03:33,989
This is Reshma.

764
01:03:34,904 --> 01:03:36,364
Any problem?

765
01:03:38,572 --> 01:03:39,865
What's her age?

766
01:03:39,946 --> 01:03:42,572
She must be 16 or 1 7 years old.

767
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,864
The girls of your hostel do
this work and you permit them?

768
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:51,904
No. All this doesn't
happen in my hostel.

769
01:03:52,904 --> 01:03:55,906
But Reshma's case is different.

770
01:03:56,574 --> 01:03:58,698
There are a lot of
problems in her family.

771
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:02,531
That's why l gave her
the permission at my risk.

772
01:04:04,824 --> 01:04:06,825
You risked her life at your risk.

773
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,532
Why? Did something happen?

774
01:04:11,074 --> 01:04:13,281
Don't worry. Easy money, baby.

775
01:04:13,407 --> 01:04:15,907
You risked the life of
a college girl?

776
01:04:16,032 --> 01:04:17,824
Couldn't you have sent someone else?

777
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:20,283
You should have at least
thought about her age!

778
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:22,950
The girl told me that
she needs money.

779
01:04:23,073 --> 01:04:24,867
So, if the customer calls,
l should send her.

780
01:04:24,951 --> 01:04:27,326
This is a case of human trafficking.
Do you understand?

781
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:30,034
We don't know how many
people are involved in this.

782
01:04:30,368 --> 01:04:31,909
You trapped a kid?

783
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:36,325
Oh, God! l didn't trap her. You
trapped her. Did you understand?

784
01:04:36,408 --> 01:04:39,034
You had said that if l
give the girl some money..

785
01:04:39,368 --> 01:04:41,743
..she will keep her
mouth shut, right?

786
01:04:44,826 --> 01:04:47,367
You had said that if l
want to hunt a lion..

787
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:48,700
..l must use a goat
as its prey, right?

788
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:52,951
But you didn't tell me what the
age and size of the goat should be.

789
01:04:53,076 --> 01:04:55,033
You are saying that l trapped her?

790
01:05:03,578 --> 01:05:04,827
Sada.

791
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:09,702
Where..

792
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,993
What did you do to Reshma?
What did you do? - Don't kill me.

793
01:05:13,077 --> 01:05:14,451
What did you do?

794
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,868
What did you do to Reshma?
- Don't kill me. - Where is she?

795
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:18,370
Arjun, let go of him.

796
01:05:18,451 --> 01:05:20,659
Arjun, let go of him.
- What did you do?

797
01:05:20,743 --> 01:05:22,537
Arjun. - What did you do
to Reshma? - Let go of him.

798
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:23,827
What's wrong with you, Sada?
- What did you do to Reshma?

799
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:25,910
l want to talk to you.
- She is a kid.

800
01:05:25,993 --> 01:05:28,995
Listen! This man is not normal.

801
01:05:29,452 --> 01:05:31,994
He killed notjust Reshma,
but also 1 1 other women.

802
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:33,577
He confessed it himself.

803
01:05:33,703 --> 01:05:35,704
And the way he
ruthlessly killed those women..

804
01:05:35,827 --> 01:05:37,410
..l don't think
anyone must have survived.

805
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,035
Sada!
- Keep quiet.

806
01:05:39,578 --> 01:05:42,412
Stop wandering on the streets.
Go home and sleep.

807
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,913
Sada, don't listen to him.
Just come with me.

808
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:48,704
Let's search at the place where we
found that taxi. l am telling you.

809
01:05:48,787 --> 01:05:50,537
We will find Reshma and the rest
of the girls over there, Sada.

810
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:51,870
Just come with me.
- Let go of my hand!

811
01:05:51,954 --> 01:05:53,330
Why don't you understand?

812
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:55,538
We are suppressing and
hiding every such case.

813
01:05:55,621 --> 01:05:56,870
And you are thinking
only about your benefit.

814
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,910
Yes. l am thinking
only about my benefit.

815
01:05:59,035 --> 01:06:01,496
l am concerned about
the lives of those girls.

816
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:05,621
l gave up the job of a policeman
to earn illegal money, Sada.

817
01:06:05,746 --> 01:06:07,496
But the matter is different today.

818
01:06:08,704 --> 01:06:10,621
Today something happened
that shouldn't have happened.

819
01:06:11,037 --> 01:06:14,911
Today, because of one mistake of
mine, all my principles broke.

820
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,410
And now l won't let that girl's
life be sacrificed for this city.

821
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:20,829
l won't let this case be suppressed.

822
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:23,705
To hell with your orders. To
hell with the business of this city.

823
01:06:23,786 --> 01:06:27,537
And to hell with all of you.
- Go! Do what you want to.

824
01:06:27,746 --> 01:06:29,455
Reshma is dead. She is dead.

825
01:06:29,578 --> 01:06:31,287
And the rest of them are dead too.

826
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:36,663
No, Sada. She is not dead.
She is alive.

827
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:39,372
She is in this city and is
calling out to me for help.

828
01:06:39,497 --> 01:06:41,329
And l want to help her.

829
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:45,621
Till today, l only heard
the voice of my brain..

830
01:06:45,746 --> 01:06:47,578
..and never the voice of my heart.

831
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:49,913
And the heart never lies.

832
01:08:12,374 --> 01:08:13,458
Dixit.

833
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,208
Who?

834
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,167
Arjun. Open the door.

835
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:25,042
You made a mistake by thrashing him.

836
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:29,917
The entire locality and
the police are the witness.

837
01:08:31,085 --> 01:08:34,294
On top of that you
are such a policeman..

838
01:08:34,751 --> 01:08:37,502
..who has a very bad track record.

839
01:08:39,252 --> 01:08:41,293
Whether he gets into trouble or not.

840
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:45,418
But the case can
surely go against you.

841
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:48,961
But anybody can be arrested
on the basis of suspicion.

842
01:08:49,086 --> 01:08:50,168
Right?

843
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,459
Can't we put him behind
bars for a few more days?

844
01:08:52,752 --> 01:08:54,044
Yes. Yes.

845
01:08:54,293 --> 01:08:55,586
But why?

846
01:08:56,584 --> 01:09:00,003
You are saying that
Dhiraj is responsible..

847
01:09:00,129 --> 01:09:01,545
..for Reshma and the
other girls' disappearance.

848
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:04,212
He will deny it.

849
01:09:05,461 --> 01:09:07,460
The court will ask for evidence.

850
01:09:08,419 --> 01:09:13,129
Or else it will ignore it thinking
that it's a crazy man's nonsense.

851
01:09:14,254 --> 01:09:17,421
And release him by
tomorrow afternoon.

852
01:09:17,711 --> 01:09:19,004
Oh, no.

853
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:21,504
There should be a way.

854
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:24,130
l don't want him to
be released so easily.

855
01:09:24,255 --> 01:09:26,379
Yes. There is only one way.

856
01:09:27,505 --> 01:09:30,421
You will have to gather
evidences against him.

857
01:09:31,379 --> 01:09:34,088
To make your case strong.

858
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:37,712
How will you do all this overnight?

859
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:40,171
Only you know that.

860
01:09:42,088 --> 01:09:43,170
Davar.
- Yes, boss.

861
01:09:43,256 --> 01:09:44,463
Did you get the
address of that number?

862
01:09:44,588 --> 01:09:45,670
No, boss. l am trying.

863
01:09:45,963 --> 01:09:47,546
Okay. l am going to Pororim,
to that girl's house.

864
01:09:47,629 --> 01:09:49,463
Okay, boss.
- Be ready.

865
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:51,337
l might need you.

866
01:09:51,422 --> 01:09:52,506
Okay, boss.

867
01:10:08,046 --> 01:10:10,588
The number you have
dialed is currently busy.

868
01:10:10,713 --> 01:10:12,963
Please try again later.

869
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,713
The number you have
dialed is currently..

870
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:35,380
Nirmala Pandit has sent me.

871
01:10:36,963 --> 01:10:38,546
Take this. Talk to her.

872
01:10:44,215 --> 01:10:45,255
Sister.

873
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,464
Friend.

874
01:10:49,257 --> 01:10:52,133
Friend. Friend. Friend.

875
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:53,923
How are you?

876
01:10:54,756 --> 01:10:57,424
l have heard they are
taking good care of you.

877
01:11:00,007 --> 01:11:01,298
How do l know?

878
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:05,381
A few of my men keep me up-to-date.

879
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:09,924
As it is, l keep all the
information of my community.

880
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,633
All.

881
01:11:12,174 --> 01:11:13,300
Listen.

882
01:11:13,423 --> 01:11:15,507
l am coming to your city. Yes.

883
01:11:15,591 --> 01:11:17,425
l will reach there in six hours.

884
01:11:17,715 --> 01:11:19,424
Don't worry.

885
01:11:19,547 --> 01:11:25,174
l will take you away
from there very easily.

886
01:11:27,214 --> 01:11:29,965
Friend, be patient.

887
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:33,257
The fruit of
patience is Nirmala Pandit.

888
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:36,133
Nirmala Pandit.

889
01:13:34,596 --> 01:13:36,429
You made such a grave mistake.
And you are telling me now.

890
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:38,054
Sir, at that time
the case wasn't so big.

891
01:13:38,138 --> 01:13:40,095
Some people complained
against Vasco in Pandey's case.

892
01:13:40,179 --> 01:13:42,096
The other officers and l
didn't take him seriously.

893
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:44,347
And sir, there was no solid
proof against him. That's why..

894
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,054
That's why you released him.

895
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,389
Ridiculous!
- Sorry, sir.

896
01:13:49,515 --> 01:13:51,263
Jai Hind, sir!
- Tell me.

897
01:13:51,388 --> 01:13:53,473
Sir, he is waiting since
a long time to meet you.

898
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,306
Mr. Khan.

899
01:13:57,554 --> 01:13:58,638
Yes. Tell me.

900
01:13:58,764 --> 01:14:00,556
l saw you on TV.

901
01:14:01,598 --> 01:14:04,516
You were searching for a
missing foreigner girl..

902
01:14:04,597 --> 01:14:06,222
..since many months.

903
01:14:06,349 --> 01:14:08,307
Yes. She is the
daughter of a French diplomat.

904
01:14:11,264 --> 01:14:12,931
l have been coming to
the police station..

905
01:14:13,056 --> 01:14:14,473
..for the past three months.

906
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:17,056
My 16-year-old
granddaughter is missing.

907
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,598
Leave him. Leave him.

908
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,098
Her father was in army.

909
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:23,556
He would protect all
of us at the border.

910
01:14:25,348 --> 01:14:28,724
His wife went crazy in grief.

911
01:14:29,099 --> 01:14:31,516
And all of you only
care about your politics.

912
01:14:32,015 --> 01:14:34,055
l have still not received any help.

913
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:40,722
She wasn't a rich man or
a foreigner's daughter.

914
01:14:41,432 --> 01:14:43,516
That's why all of
you couldn't find her.

915
01:14:46,558 --> 01:14:47,932
Jai Hind.

916
01:14:52,598 --> 01:14:54,430
All of you leave right now.

917
01:14:57,223 --> 01:15:00,099
To arrest someone, sir?

918
01:15:00,222 --> 01:15:01,391
No, you fool.

919
01:15:02,099 --> 01:15:03,724
To gather dismembered hands and feet.

920
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:05,932
To gather evidence.

921
01:15:08,349 --> 01:15:09,433
Yes?

922
01:15:09,556 --> 01:15:10,598
l am from the police.

923
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:13,224
l want to talk about Dhiraj Pandey.

924
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:19,348
Why?

925
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,017
ls he dead?

926
01:15:23,726 --> 01:15:25,309
No. He is alive.

927
01:15:26,349 --> 01:15:28,099
l want to know everything about him.

928
01:15:31,433 --> 01:15:33,267
l don't have any son.

929
01:15:33,599 --> 01:15:37,557
My husband, my
daughter and l live here.

930
01:15:38,516 --> 01:15:39,683
Bye.

931
01:15:40,393 --> 01:15:41,642
You can leave.

932
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,224
Don't use the formula of
saving your son on me.

933
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,682
Otherwise l will put
you behind bars.

934
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:47,599
Look. Look, actually..
- Mother. Father.

935
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,226
Demon.. Demon..
- Dear.

936
01:15:52,351 --> 01:15:54,060
Pooja. Pooja, what happened?

937
01:15:54,143 --> 01:15:55,269
Pooja. Pooja, what happened?

938
01:15:55,392 --> 01:15:56,434
Pooja.

939
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,934
No, dear. No. Don't do that.

940
01:15:58,059 --> 01:15:59,185
What happened?

941
01:15:59,269 --> 01:16:00,353
Pooja.

942
01:16:00,434 --> 01:16:01,560
No, dear. No.

943
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:02,934
No.

944
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,144
l saw.

945
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:05,727
That demon is in this room.

946
01:16:06,184 --> 01:16:07,477
That demon.

947
01:16:07,602 --> 01:16:08,933
No. No. Nobody is here.

948
01:16:09,058 --> 01:16:10,393
Mother.

949
01:16:10,477 --> 01:16:11,728
We thrashed him very badly.

950
01:16:12,018 --> 01:16:13,100
We thrashed him very badly.

951
01:16:13,227 --> 01:16:14,685
We thrashed and drove him away.
There is nobody here.

952
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:16,060
Nobody, dear.

953
01:16:16,183 --> 01:16:17,267
Nobody.

954
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:20,976
He locked me in the room.
He thrashed me very badly.

955
01:16:21,102 --> 01:16:23,351
He thrashed me very badly, mother.

956
01:16:34,185 --> 01:16:35,434
She is our daughter-in-law.

957
01:16:37,435 --> 01:16:39,603
We got her married two years ago.

958
01:16:40,269 --> 01:16:41,560
To Dhiraj.

959
01:16:45,311 --> 01:16:50,561
What did we know that we are
putting her in an animal's cage?

960
01:16:52,437 --> 01:16:55,104
He would keep her
locked for many days.

961
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:58,187
We didn't even know.

962
01:16:59,104 --> 01:17:00,520
When we found out..

963
01:17:01,688 --> 01:17:04,023
..we threw him out of the house.

964
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:06,646
And we made our
daughter-in-law our daughter.

965
01:17:08,603 --> 01:17:11,064
Now, whether he lives or dies..

966
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:14,479
..we don't care.

967
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:29,438
The number you have
dialed is currently busy.

968
01:17:29,522 --> 01:17:31,188
Please try again..

969
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:49,606
''Forgetting you.''

970
01:17:51,356 --> 01:17:57,650
''And not crying.''

971
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:02,439
''l have learnt it now.''

972
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,440
''Forgetting you.''

973
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:22,607
''And not crying.''

974
01:18:22,733 --> 01:18:25,983
''And smiling.''

975
01:18:26,106 --> 01:18:28,483
''l have learnt it now.''

976
01:18:29,441 --> 01:18:31,940
''l have learnt it now.''

977
01:18:32,065 --> 01:18:33,191
Amazing!

978
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:35,066
A scoundrel has come to
meet another scoundrel.

979
01:18:38,274 --> 01:18:40,315
lf it's for my benefit, we will talk.

980
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,317
lf it's for your benefit, go to hell.

981
01:18:46,483 --> 01:18:48,607
l suffered losses because
you conducted so many raids.

982
01:18:48,733 --> 01:18:50,399
You drove away my customers.

983
01:18:50,483 --> 01:18:55,066
You took all my men in remand.

984
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,399
One by one all the call girls
have disappeared from the city.

985
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,106
l don't know whether
they are alive or dead.

986
01:18:59,231 --> 01:19:01,525
lf this goes on, your
business will close down.

987
01:19:01,608 --> 01:19:03,024
AUR EK FHENl (GOAS
LlQUOR) Kl KHUL JAYEGl.

988
01:19:03,108 --> 01:19:04,232
Will you talk now?

989
01:19:04,357 --> 01:19:06,065
Or shall l pump all
three bullets in you?

990
01:19:06,191 --> 01:19:08,025
Let's talk. Let's talk.

991
01:19:08,108 --> 01:19:11,358
''Listen, betrayer,''

992
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:15,068
''l have decided.''

993
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:21,317
''l will live without you.''

994
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:26,317
''Now, l don't feel any pain.''

995
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:29,734
''Night has befallen.''

996
01:19:30,027 --> 01:19:37,235
''lt's the chasm between you and me.''

997
01:19:37,318 --> 01:19:44,192
''Getting rid of your memories.''

998
01:19:44,278 --> 01:19:47,985
''And not hurting my heart.''

999
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:50,111
''l have learnt it now.''

1000
01:19:50,237 --> 01:19:51,279
This..

1001
01:19:51,402 --> 01:19:53,236
This is the same number,
right? Yes. This is the one.

1002
01:19:53,361 --> 01:19:55,112
Sonia had gone with this person.

1003
01:19:55,237 --> 01:19:57,403
Sonia? - One moment. l
will show you her photo.

1004
01:19:57,486 --> 01:19:58,942
She is a private dancer.

1005
01:20:00,235 --> 01:20:01,651
She has not come here
since the past month.

1006
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,529
And you must have not
even inquired, right?

1007
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:07,485
You know in whose party she
danced the last time, don't you?

1008
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:10,570
l go to sleep after
taking my share of money.

1009
01:20:10,653 --> 01:20:12,318
l don't keep an eye on the girls.

1010
01:20:12,444 --> 01:20:14,277
She must have gone to another client.

1011
01:20:14,403 --> 01:20:15,487
Where will l find her?

1012
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:22,194
''You have left from
the abode of my heart.''

1013
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:28,568
''You don't dwell in it any longer.''

1014
01:20:29,445 --> 01:20:36,445
''Now, you are no longer
in my prayer.''

1015
01:20:37,027 --> 01:20:40,944
''You are a stranger.''

1016
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,235
''You have lost the right
to be in it.''

1017
01:20:44,361 --> 01:20:47,070
''Forgetting you.''

1018
01:20:47,485 --> 01:20:51,195
''And not crying.''

1019
01:20:51,278 --> 01:20:54,657
''And smiling.''

1020
01:20:54,782 --> 01:20:58,239
''l have learnt it now.''

1021
01:20:58,615 --> 01:21:01,071
''l have learnt it now.''

1022
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:03,531
''l have learnt it now.''

1023
01:21:03,613 --> 01:21:04,697
Sonia.

1024
01:21:07,281 --> 01:21:08,365
What do you mean?

1025
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:15,239
l mean, he was a man
only in name, sir.

1026
01:21:16,323 --> 01:21:17,532
But not otherwise.

1027
01:21:17,613 --> 01:21:19,157
l went with him.

1028
01:21:19,573 --> 01:21:21,158
To a hotel.

1029
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:23,572
We tried for a whole hour.

1030
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,657
He couldn't do anything.

1031
01:21:27,572 --> 01:21:28,614
He said..

1032
01:21:29,448 --> 01:21:31,242
''Remove your clothes and dance.''

1033
01:21:32,199 --> 01:21:35,365
When l started dancing, he beat me.

1034
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,115
With his slippers.

1035
01:21:37,573 --> 01:21:40,240
He jabbed the
cigarette butt on my chest.

1036
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,698
He ruined my face.

1037
01:21:43,615 --> 01:21:46,034
l ran away somehow.

1038
01:21:46,115 --> 01:21:47,241
Then?

1039
01:21:48,574 --> 01:21:49,658
What else?

1040
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,657
l didn't go for work
for many months.

1041
01:21:53,616 --> 01:21:54,990
Out of fear.

1042
01:21:59,034 --> 01:22:00,740
You didn't lodge a police complaint?

1043
01:22:03,491 --> 01:22:05,200
Let it be, sir.

1044
01:22:07,033 --> 01:22:11,948
lf a call girl is raped or if
she is murdered in the open..

1045
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:14,074
..the police don't do anything.

1046
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:17,199
Even pimps don't lock
horns with customers.

1047
01:22:17,408 --> 01:22:19,365
They are considered God.

1048
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:27,534
lf you see that man again,
will you be able to recognize him?

1049
01:22:29,742 --> 01:22:31,116
Yes, sir.

1050
01:22:31,784 --> 01:22:34,076
There is only one face of the devil.

1051
01:22:35,535 --> 01:22:37,326
l can recognize him in a throng.

1052
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:43,951
But why are you asking this?

1053
01:22:48,285 --> 01:22:49,745
Did he do something?

1054
01:22:51,326 --> 01:22:53,243
Has another girl got into trouble?

1055
01:22:54,492 --> 01:22:56,117
She won't survive.

1056
01:22:56,619 --> 01:22:58,993
Poor girl must have died by now.

1057
01:22:59,326 --> 01:23:00,744
She must have died, sir.

1058
01:23:01,034 --> 01:23:03,244
She must have died.

1059
01:24:38,746 --> 01:24:41,122
Priya, l told you..
- Arjun, wait.

1060
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:45,080
l want to talk to you.

1061
01:24:46,622 --> 01:24:48,078
Don't say anything.

1062
01:24:49,747 --> 01:24:50,996
Just listen to me.

1063
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:53,373
Priya, we can..
- Just let me finish.

1064
01:24:56,497 --> 01:24:57,746
Look, Arjun.

1065
01:25:00,455 --> 01:25:03,706
My mother loved my
foreigner father a lot.

1066
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:08,581
But father didn't love her at all.

1067
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:12,665
He only married her.
- Priya, please.

1068
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:14,248
Arjun, let me finish.

1069
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:22,082
One day..

1070
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:26,331
..my foreigner father
left my mother alone.

1071
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:29,957
And he fled to London.

1072
01:25:32,206 --> 01:25:34,291
My mother went insane in this grief.

1073
01:25:36,373 --> 01:25:37,541
As long as she was alive..

1074
01:25:40,043 --> 01:25:42,000
..she would remember only father.

1075
01:25:44,624 --> 01:25:46,332
My story is also the same.

1076
01:25:48,456 --> 01:25:50,000
Same to same.

1077
01:25:51,293 --> 01:25:53,665
lt's not that l
don't find another man.

1078
01:25:54,334 --> 01:25:55,957
Or there is some flaw in me.

1079
01:26:00,794 --> 01:26:03,250
l am my crazy mother's
crazy daughter.

1080
01:26:06,459 --> 01:26:08,209
l fell in love with a man.

1081
01:26:08,752 --> 01:26:10,667
And l weaved dreams of him.

1082
01:26:11,793 --> 01:26:13,209
And you.

1083
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:17,585
l don't know what your feelings are.

1084
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:20,419
You spend nights with me.

1085
01:26:21,459 --> 01:26:23,001
But you don't love me.

1086
01:26:24,502 --> 01:26:25,752
You suffer.

1087
01:26:27,168 --> 01:26:28,335
But you don't love me.

1088
01:26:30,044 --> 01:26:32,126
You say, ''Go and find somebody else.''

1089
01:26:35,251 --> 01:26:36,586
And you don't even leave me.

1090
01:26:38,085 --> 01:26:40,251
So now, Arjun.

1091
01:26:41,711 --> 01:26:43,169
Just tell me.

1092
01:26:44,376 --> 01:26:45,586
What should l do?

1093
01:26:49,753 --> 01:26:51,043
Where do l go?

1094
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:53,293
Priya, l am wandering in darkness.

1095
01:26:53,377 --> 01:26:55,252
How will l show you the way?

1096
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,669
You are talking about your mother.

1097
01:26:59,419 --> 01:27:01,710
My mother used to sell
candles outside the church.

1098
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:03,628
So that there is light
in other people's houses.

1099
01:27:03,753 --> 01:27:05,002
What happened to her?

1100
01:27:05,127 --> 01:27:06,752
My mother and my sister
consumed poison and died.

1101
01:27:07,045 --> 01:27:08,753
So that l could live and survive.

1102
01:27:10,169 --> 01:27:11,711
My father committed suicide.

1103
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:13,585
To escape from the shock.

1104
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,502
Everybody left me alone.

1105
01:27:16,628 --> 01:27:17,712
And you..

1106
01:27:22,127 --> 01:27:23,545
Do you know? Today, because of me..

1107
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:27,046
..because of me a
girl has disappeared.

1108
01:27:28,253 --> 01:27:29,543
l am searching for her.

1109
01:27:30,627 --> 01:27:32,544
Her story is also
similar to mine, Priya.

1110
01:27:34,128 --> 01:27:37,004
Her family will starve to
death if anything happened to her.

1111
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,044
Her mother will ask for an answer.

1112
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:40,254
And l don't have it.

1113
01:27:41,004 --> 01:27:43,086
Nobody has any answer.

1114
01:27:43,754 --> 01:27:46,461
Priya, l have neither any
cure for your loneliness..

1115
01:27:47,088 --> 01:27:48,546
..nor do l intent to
return your love.

1116
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:55,503
Priya, please. Please leave.

1117
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,546
Don't.

1118
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,755
Hello.

1119
01:28:39,048 --> 01:28:41,337
Yes, boss. l have got
the address of that number.

1120
01:28:41,464 --> 01:28:43,255
The SlM card is
registered in this address.

1121
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,172
The number was
purchased around a year ago.

1122
01:28:45,504 --> 01:28:48,255
But some Mohan Borkar stays here.

1123
01:28:52,006 --> 01:28:53,088
Who is it?

1124
01:28:53,756 --> 01:28:55,047
Who is it?

1125
01:28:55,548 --> 01:28:57,422
l want to talk about Dhiraj Pandey?

1126
01:29:02,297 --> 01:29:03,423
Who is it?

1127
01:29:03,506 --> 01:29:04,588
Open the door.

1128
01:29:09,007 --> 01:29:10,590
l am here to talk about Dhiraj.

1129
01:29:10,715 --> 01:29:14,381
Just a second.

1130
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,426
Trying to run away.

1131
01:29:39,551 --> 01:29:40,675
Trying to run away from us.

1132
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:42,133
Where are the girls?
- l don't know.

1133
01:29:42,259 --> 01:29:43,468
You have ruined business.

1134
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:45,051
l don't know anything.

1135
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:46,384
Don't lie or else l will beat you.

1136
01:29:46,467 --> 01:29:48,341
Tell me.
- No.

1137
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:50,300
Where is Reshma?

1138
01:29:50,425 --> 01:29:51,676
Where is Reshma?
- Reshma who?

1139
01:29:51,802 --> 01:29:53,176
l don't know any Reshma.

1140
01:29:53,301 --> 01:29:54,383
l am a sculpture.

1141
01:29:54,467 --> 01:29:55,551
Then why did you try
to run after seeing me?

1142
01:29:55,634 --> 01:29:57,011
l didn't run after seeing you, sir.

1143
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:59,342
l ran seeing that Dhiraj.

1144
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,134
He is insane. l am scared of him.

1145
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,593
He is not human. He is a devil.

1146
01:30:05,052 --> 01:30:06,759
He doesn't have a soul.

1147
01:30:07,717 --> 01:30:09,052
How do you know, Dhiraj?

1148
01:30:13,135 --> 01:30:14,635
We met two years ago, sir.

1149
01:30:15,594 --> 01:30:18,470
We both used to work
in a sculpting shop.

1150
01:30:19,053 --> 01:30:20,260
He was fine at first, sir.

1151
01:30:21,634 --> 01:30:23,677
But wonder what happened to him.

1152
01:30:24,218 --> 01:30:26,676
The boss would ask him to
make the Goddess's idol.

1153
01:30:29,552 --> 01:30:31,470
And he would make the witch's idol.

1154
01:30:33,218 --> 01:30:35,135
He would make idols of demons.

1155
01:30:35,635 --> 01:30:37,552
One day the boss stopped him.

1156
01:30:38,218 --> 01:30:41,429
And he hit an iron rod
on the boss's head, sir.

1157
01:30:41,677 --> 01:30:43,428
The boss died on the spot.

1158
01:30:44,303 --> 01:30:46,135
l didn't do anything.

1159
01:30:46,803 --> 01:30:50,719
l...l stole some idols, sir.

1160
01:30:51,761 --> 01:30:54,679
l thought l will sell
them and earn some money.

1161
01:30:55,719 --> 01:30:58,094
But l couldn't sell them, sir.

1162
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,470
No one bought them.

1163
01:31:04,471 --> 01:31:08,554
Sir.
- So you killed those girls?

1164
01:31:13,805 --> 01:31:16,136
Hey. l am talking to you.

1165
01:31:17,429 --> 01:31:19,054
Has the cat got your tongue?

1166
01:31:19,762 --> 01:31:25,138
Pandey, tell sir
everything you told me.

1167
01:31:25,305 --> 01:31:26,638
What did l say?

1168
01:31:28,305 --> 01:31:30,429
l didn't say anything, sir, l..

1169
01:31:32,346 --> 01:31:34,554
l am seeing him for the first time.

1170
01:31:37,221 --> 01:31:39,429
Do l look like a fool to you?

1171
01:31:42,222 --> 01:31:44,262
Now tell me clearly
where you buried them?

1172
01:31:45,307 --> 01:31:47,762
Otherwise l will make
your plight really bad.

1173
01:31:51,471 --> 01:31:53,303
l didn't murder anyone, sir.

1174
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,430
l have a tumour in my brain, sir.

1175
01:32:03,469 --> 01:32:05,181
A big one, sir.

1176
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:10,470
And...why will l murder anyone, sir?

1177
01:32:14,388 --> 01:32:16,139
There is just one cure
to his tumour.

1178
01:32:16,264 --> 01:32:19,222
Call Dr. Sajia and make him confess.

1179
01:32:19,347 --> 01:32:21,348
Look, the police are investigating.

1180
01:32:21,471 --> 01:32:23,182
Sir, l called them.

1181
01:32:23,307 --> 01:32:25,222
They won't make it here.

1182
01:32:25,306 --> 01:32:26,432
Sir.

1183
01:32:27,347 --> 01:32:29,097
Announce on television.

1184
01:32:29,347 --> 01:32:31,056
A serial-killer has been caught.

1185
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:33,180
So, Dhiraj Pandey.

1186
01:32:35,555 --> 01:32:40,762
Where are you from?
- Kanpur.

1187
01:32:43,473 --> 01:32:46,391
How did you come here?
- My father brought me here.

1188
01:32:46,475 --> 01:32:53,557
He...got a job here
so...he brought me along.

1189
01:32:54,057 --> 01:32:55,266
Are you married?

1190
01:32:57,058 --> 01:32:58,349
Are you married?

1191
01:33:01,724 --> 01:33:03,017
l was.

1192
01:33:05,726 --> 01:33:07,140
l left my wife.

1193
01:33:07,599 --> 01:33:11,098
l see. Then why did you marry her?

1194
01:33:12,809 --> 01:33:14,516
My parents forced me to.

1195
01:33:15,558 --> 01:33:17,016
That's why l did.

1196
01:33:17,309 --> 01:33:19,017
Are you ashamed of woman?

1197
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:24,560
Or are you impotent?
- Both.

1198
01:33:30,183 --> 01:33:35,225
l made myself...impotent.

1199
01:33:37,185 --> 01:33:39,392
One night the Goddess
visited me in my dreams.'

1200
01:33:41,184 --> 01:33:43,143
She told me to do so.

1201
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:49,309
So l went to a eunuch called Nirva..

1202
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:53,267
..and said to her
''Make me one of you''.

1203
01:33:55,143 --> 01:33:57,518
So she did.

1204
01:34:12,312 --> 01:34:14,102
And the reason behind this deed?

1205
01:34:14,768 --> 01:34:19,353
The addiction of women. The habit.

1206
01:34:22,104 --> 01:34:24,270
l used to go to women day and night.

1207
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:27,728
Day and night. Day and night.

1208
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:31,603
Then on the night the
Goddess visited me in my dreams..

1209
01:34:32,396 --> 01:34:34,644
..l got rid of the
root of this problem.

1210
01:34:39,064 --> 01:34:40,603
Women are devils, doctor.

1211
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,564
They make men stray.

1212
01:34:46,729 --> 01:34:48,770
That's why l hate them.

1213
01:34:49,647 --> 01:34:51,437
l hit them with my shoe.

1214
01:34:52,022 --> 01:34:54,687
l show them their right place.
- No, no.

1215
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:58,438
You do much more than that.

1216
01:34:59,647 --> 01:35:01,605
You kill them.

1217
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:06,062
You severe their hands
and legs and discard them.

1218
01:35:07,271 --> 01:35:10,396
You bury them in a way
that no one can know.

1219
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:15,979
You are a woman after all.

1220
01:35:18,604 --> 01:35:20,397
That's why you are
taking sides of prostitutes

1221
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:26,021
l am not taking sides just
showing you your real image.

1222
01:35:27,565 --> 01:35:30,604
l want you to see
the fiend inside you.

1223
01:35:31,147 --> 01:35:33,021
To see your filth.

1224
01:35:33,605 --> 01:35:39,648
To recognise your ugly face.
- Stop it now.

1225
01:35:42,731 --> 01:35:46,396
Why?
- l feel sleepy.

1226
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,189
You can't tolerate it?

1227
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,730
l am amazed.

1228
01:35:52,773 --> 01:35:56,148
There is no shame or
regret in your eyes.

1229
01:35:57,732 --> 01:36:01,316
Even after doing all this
you can look me in the eye.

1230
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:03,691
Stop your nonsense now.

1231
01:36:06,564 --> 01:36:09,066
You got rid of the root of problem.

1232
01:36:11,148 --> 01:36:12,690
But the hunger is still there.

1233
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:17,439
You still need a woman.
- l said stop it.

1234
01:36:17,523 --> 01:36:21,692
You cannot do anything
now...that's why you kill them.

1235
01:36:23,273 --> 01:36:26,732
You severe their hands and legs.
- Be quiet.

1236
01:36:27,605 --> 01:36:29,232
And then have fun.

1237
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:33,648
They kept screaming
and you closed your ears.

1238
01:36:33,773 --> 01:36:35,024
Stop it now.

1239
01:36:35,149 --> 01:36:38,318
Men like you should be left
on the streets. - Be quiet.

1240
01:36:38,443 --> 01:36:41,192
So the people can
tear you limb from limb.

1241
01:36:41,317 --> 01:36:43,107
l cannot repeat the same
thing again.

1242
01:36:43,191 --> 01:36:44,442
You should be burnt.

1243
01:36:44,525 --> 01:36:46,274
Hanged by the noose.

1244
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:48,442
Rascal, l said stop.

1245
01:36:48,567 --> 01:36:50,025
Trying to mock me.

1246
01:36:50,148 --> 01:36:51,773
You think you are very brave.

1247
01:36:52,065 --> 01:36:53,356
You

1248
01:36:53,484 --> 01:36:54,693

1249
01:36:54,816 --> 01:36:56,274
l will kill you.

1250
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:57,983
Who do you think you are?

1251
01:36:58,108 --> 01:37:00,067
l told you to keep quiet.

1252
01:37:00,192 --> 01:37:01,316
Leave me. Leave me.

1253
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:02,607
But you don't seem to listen.

1254
01:37:02,693 --> 01:37:05,026
Are you okay.
- l am fine.

1255
01:37:06,651 --> 01:37:08,150
Take him to the police station..

1256
01:37:08,276 --> 01:37:09,608
..and l will get the other witnesses.

1257
01:37:10,316 --> 01:37:12,234
l am going to Dhiraj's
home to get his father.

1258
01:37:13,276 --> 01:37:14,483
And inform Sameer.

1259
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,109
Understand.
- Okay.

1260
01:38:07,154 --> 01:38:08,485
Sakhi.

1261
01:38:10,321 --> 01:38:12,196
You are making a big
mistake by saving him.

1262
01:38:12,322 --> 01:38:16,113
You are making a mistake by
entrapping the devotee of Goddess.

1263
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,737
l will levy a curse on you
that will make you suffer badly.

1264
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:28,070
Go. Tell your
sycophants to let him go.

1265
01:38:28,363 --> 01:38:30,487
l am here to take him back.

1266
01:38:30,612 --> 01:38:32,780
And close these cases.

1267
01:38:33,486 --> 01:38:39,197
Remember, there's a red
beacon on my car as well.

1268
01:38:42,405 --> 01:38:43,738
What can you do?

1269
01:38:45,488 --> 01:38:48,111
How can you harm me? Tell me.

1270
01:38:48,613 --> 01:38:50,154
You want to see.

The phone will ring right now.

And your plight after that.

1274
01:38:59,488 --> 01:39:03,198
You will dance at
marriages at nights..

1275
01:39:03,321 --> 01:39:05,696
..and beg at traffic
signals during the day.

1276
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:26,196
Hello. - Khan, l told
you to leave this case.

We will first go to the
temple in front of your house.

1293
01:41:11,742 --> 01:41:13,367
What are you staring at?

1294
01:41:13,493 --> 01:41:15,034
Don't you want to visit
the Bahucharaji temple?

1295
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:16,327
The same temple that l constructed..

1296

..from the money l
earned from my dancing.

1297
01:41:18,451 --> 01:41:20,201
And you constructed the idol in it.

1298
01:41:20,327 --> 01:41:21,369
The same temple.

01:42:36,289 --> 01:42:37,538
l don't know.

1315
01:42:37,663 --> 01:42:39,455
He is a terrible man.

1316
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:41,122
He lives around.

1317
01:42:41,247 --> 01:42:43,747
He tried to kill a girl.

1318
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:46,789
She was saying that he
has killed many girls.

1319
01:42:47,331 --> 01:42:48,996
What has this age come to?

1320

Boy, have l

01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:30,166
Hey boy, l am asking you.

''The eyes convey.''

1334
01:44:20,585 --> 01:44:24,250
''What the lips don't.''

1335
01:44:31,751 --> 01:44:35,458
''Try to hear it.''

1336
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:43,501
''You won't sleep tonight.''

1337
01:44:44,501 --> 01:44:46,751

How did you escape?

Move aside.

Sada, tell them.
- Let him come.

1350
01:47:11,092 --> 01:47:12,466
Don't go there now.

1351

Don't go there.

01:47:18,093 --> 01:47:19,593
Arjun, don't go there. Arjun.

01:47:44,093 --> 01:47:58,133
''And went...astray.''

1355
01:48:09,844 --> 01:48:14,552
''What is this uneasiness
in my heart?''

1356
01:48:14,677 --> 01:48:18,468
''Mistakes seem a part of my nature.''

1357
01:48:18,552 --> 01:48:23,260
''l was the one that
didn't trust your grace.''

1358
01:48:23,343 --> 01:48:32,260
''Lord, l stumbled. l stumbled.''

1359
01:48:32,345 --> 01:48:36,636
''As l drifted apart from You.''

1360
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:43,177
''l was ruined. l was ruined.''

1361
01:49:00,595 --> 01:49:05,427
''l made so many mistakes.''

1362
01:49:05,511 --> 01:49:09,510
''Like money was my only God.''

1363
01:49:09,636 --> 01:49:14,594
''Every moment was like a breeze.''

1364
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:20,593
''You walked under
the influence of evil.''

1365
01:49:20,677 --> 01:49:22,304
Son, you dropped your packet.

1366
01:49:22,385 --> 01:49:25,219
''You did as you wished.''

1367
01:49:25,345 --> 01:49:26,554
God bless you.

1368
01:49:26,677 --> 01:49:32,304
''You were your own culprit.''

1369
01:49:32,429 --> 01:49:41,556
''Lord, l stumbled. l stumbled.''

1370
01:49:41,681 --> 01:49:45,681
''As l drifted apart from You.''

Let me know if there is any
assignment or photo shoot.

01:49:55,847 --> 01:49:57,513
But you had refused.

1374
01:50:00,682 --> 01:50:05,139
l didn't refuse, l had faith.

1375
01:50:05,225 --> 01:50:06,599
Fine, l will tell if
there's something.

1376
01:50:19,432 --> 01:50:24,140
''Why are you so
attached to this world?''

1377
01:50:24,223 --> 01:50:28,557
''One day it will pass away.''

1378
01:50:28,683 --> 01:50:33,140
''No matter how much
you try to gather.''

1379
01:50:33,265 --> 01:50:38,140
''lt will slip through your fists.''

1380
01:50:38,266 --> 01:50:40,183
Reshma.

1381
01:50:42,681 --> 01:50:47,226
''Every person's made of elements.''

1382
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:51,683
''And later reduces into it.''

1383
01:50:51,808 --> 01:50:56,475
''This is the truth.''

1384
01:50:56,556 --> 01:51:01,101
''Why do you try to defy it?''

1385
01:51:02,141 --> 01:51:04,725
''No matter how many
wishes you fulfil.''

1386
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:07,016
''This nature will never cease.''
- Reshma.

1387
01:51:07,142 --> 01:51:09,309
''You will be reduced to dust.''

1388
01:51:09,516 --> 01:51:14,015
''You will never be
able to fill this void.''

1389
01:51:14,141 --> 01:51:23,103
''Lord, l stumbled. l stumbled.''
- Reshma.

1390
01:51:23,226 --> 01:51:27,560
''As l drifted apart from You.''

''l was ruined. l was ruined.''

1392
01:51:33,436 --> 01:51:34,766
He would beat them brutally.

l managed to escape somehow.

1394
01:51:37,227 --> 01:51:39,518
He is a dangerous man.

1395
01:51:39,643 --> 01:51:41,684
Tell me your name.

'We both used to work
in a sculpting shop.'

1410
01:53:22,355 --> 01:53:24,605
'The boss would ask him to
make the Goddess's idol.

1411
01:53:24,688 --> 01:53:26,313
'And he would make the witch's idol.'

1412
01:53:26,438 --> 01:53:28,063
'He would make idols of demons.'

1413
01:53:28,189 --> 01:53:30,313
He is not human. He is a devil.

1414
01:53:30,397 --> 01:53:32,479
He doesn't have a soul.

1415
01:53:41,230 --> 01:53:50,106
'l will love you...until dawn.'

1416
01:54:00,815 --> 01:54:02,482
Excuse me.

1417
01:54:03,065 --> 01:54:06,108
Where is this address?

1418
01:54:10,607 --> 01:54:17,274
''My lonely heart.''

1419
01:54:20,108 --> 01:54:22,107
So you are here as well.

1420
01:54:26,149 --> 01:54:27,483
Come in.

1421
01:54:27,567 --> 01:54:29,190
Come here.

1422
01:54:37,233 --> 01:54:40,483
You took too long.

1423
01:54:59,068 --> 01:55:00,484
Getting ready.

1424
01:55:02,067 --> 01:55:03,651
Who are you waiting for?

1425
01:55:04,735 --> 01:55:06,318
Another girl.

1426
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:08,526
Another prey.

1427
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:10,694
That's what you do, isn't it?

1428
01:55:11,776 --> 01:55:13,361
Sometimes you pose as a woman.

1429
01:55:13,777 --> 01:55:15,485
Sometimes a customer.

1430
01:55:16,692 --> 01:55:19,027
You set out like a wolf on a hunt.

1431
01:55:22,361 --> 01:55:24,237
Where did you kill her?

1432
01:57:12,698 --> 01:57:13,823
Arjun.

1433
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:24,739
Arjun.

1434
01:57:31,782 --> 01:57:34,282
Priya, let's go. Let's go.

1435
01:57:35,366 --> 01:57:37,448
Get out of here, please.

1436
01:57:40,449 --> 01:57:42,030
Arjun!

1437
01:57:44,822 --> 01:57:47,114
No! No!

1438
01:57:47,197 --> 01:57:49,282
Come on. Come on.

1439
01:57:49,656 --> 01:57:53,031
You shouldn't step out of
the house at this late hour.

1440
01:57:54,198 --> 01:57:56,491
You must be thinking
what is she doing here?

1441
01:57:56,574 --> 01:57:58,074
l called her here.

1442
01:57:58,199 --> 01:57:59,490
l called her.

1443
01:57:59,574 --> 01:58:02,780
So that you can see. You
would ask what l do with girls.

1444
01:58:03,074 --> 01:58:04,156
Take a look.

1445
01:58:04,282 --> 01:58:06,450
First l bring them here.
- Leave me.

1446
01:58:06,531 --> 01:58:08,618
Quiet.
- Then l tie them up. - Leave me.

1447
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,493
Not because l am scared.

1448
01:58:10,577 --> 01:58:12,116
They scream a lot.

1449
01:58:12,242 --> 01:58:14,075
Leave me.
- Louder.

1450
01:58:14,201 --> 01:58:16,074
l like it. l like it a lot.

1451
01:58:16,494 --> 01:58:18,242
Arjun.

1452
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:22,326
After that l tie their legs.

1453
01:58:22,451 --> 01:58:23,744
They writhe a lot.

1454
01:58:23,867 --> 01:58:25,617
This is how l killed Reshma as well.
- Leave me.

1455
01:58:25,701 --> 01:58:27,451
Leave me.

1456
01:58:27,535 --> 01:58:29,283
Leave me.
- Quiet.

1457
01:58:37,452 --> 01:58:40,034
She screamed just like this.

1458
01:58:46,828 --> 01:58:49,117
But no one heard her.

1459
01:58:49,201 --> 01:58:50,619
No one heard her.

1460
01:58:50,702 --> 01:58:52,284
And she kept screaming.

1461
01:58:52,367 --> 01:58:54,368
And you just keep watching her.

1462
01:58:54,493 --> 01:58:56,244
She will scream too. Your girl.

1463
01:58:56,369 --> 01:58:58,577
You wanted to know how l kill them.

1464
01:58:59,368 --> 01:59:01,077
l will show you.

1465
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,451
l will show you.

1466
01:59:09,327 --> 01:59:15,785
''When l sever you.''

1467
01:59:17,452 --> 01:59:25,744
''lt will be such fun..''

1468
01:59:25,869 --> 01:59:28,662
Get up.

1469
01:59:29,535 --> 01:59:33,827
Scream. Scream.

1470
01:59:35,701 --> 01:59:37,493
Scream. Scream.

1471
01:59:38,287 --> 01:59:41,121
No.
- Scream. Scream.

1472
01:59:41,203 --> 01:59:43,577
Leave me.

1473
01:59:44,787 --> 01:59:47,036
Leave me.

1474
01:59:47,661 --> 01:59:49,703
No.

1475
01:59:50,704 --> 01:59:53,455
Arjun.

1476
01:59:55,497 --> 01:59:57,329
Scream.

1477
01:59:57,413 --> 01:59:59,372
Scream!

1478
02:00:06,122 --> 02:00:08,497
Arjun.

1479
02:00:19,329 --> 02:00:21,161
Arjun, stop.
- Arjun, no.

1480
02:00:21,247 --> 02:00:23,164
Stop, Arjun.
- No.

1481
02:00:23,287 --> 02:00:25,664
Don't kill him otherwise l will
be helpless to shoot you, Arjun.

1482
02:00:26,205 --> 02:00:28,749
Let him go, Arjun. Let him go.

1483
02:00:29,497 --> 02:00:31,164
Let him go.

1484
02:00:32,705 --> 02:00:34,662
No, no, you won't kill him.

1485
02:00:34,748 --> 02:00:36,496
The other police
officers are coming.

1486
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:37,705
Keep it down.

1487
02:00:40,412 --> 02:00:43,455

''Accept me with open arms.''

''You say you are
surrounded by shadows.''

''l am the light that guides you.''
