GOOD EVENING STUDENTS!

6
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,570
GOOD EVENING!

7
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,330
It's time for the biggest 
sports competition of the year...

8
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,410
...where eight colleges compete for the 
Dignity cup and today is the grand finale.

9
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,450

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,890
Come on guys, lets do this.

13
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,940
On my count.

14
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,330
ONE...TWO...

15
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,570
Come on Rohan!

16
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,330
Go, Rohan! Go!

17
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,250
-R-

18
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,690
-O-

19
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,450
-H-

20
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,450
-A-

21
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,370
-N-

22
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,410
ROHAN! ROHAN!

23
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,770
ROHAN! ROHAN!

24
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,570
Go Rohan.

25
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,970
ROHAN! ROHAN!

26
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,170
ROHAN! ROHAN!

27
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,090
ROHAN! ROHAN!

28
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,170
The ones who don't 
go after their own dream....

29
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,250
Spend their entire lives 
in fulfilling someone else's.

30
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,810
So pick your own dreams...

31
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,010
...and go after them.

32
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,650
So that one day when it turns to reality, 
you're the first one to notice.

33
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,130
STUDENT OF THE YEAR 
IS - ROHAN SACHDEV!

34
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,280
But this Student 
trophy isn't my dream.

35
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,650
My dream will turn to reality the day

36
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,890
Mia Chawla from plot 
C-4 Jhula Ghar Mussorie,

37
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,410
personally walks up to me and says...

38
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,610
Rohan Sachdev, 
from plot C-23 Jhula Ghar Mussoorie,

39
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,530
I Mridula Chawla

40
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,770
kind-of love you.

41
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,330
(Popular Hindi Poem)

42
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,490
And in the next paragraph 
the poet is trying to say...

43
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,930
Stupid kids! 
You boys will never learn!

44
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,570
Ughhhh...gaahhhhh gaahhhh...

45
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,450
INDIRA! Hand over the chalk Indira!

46
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,730
Hand over the chalk Indira!

47
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,290
Hand over the chalk Indira!

48
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,450
CHALK DE O CHALK DE INDIRA

49
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,810
CHALK DE O CHALK DE INDIRA.

50
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,170
CHALK DE O CHALK DE INDIRA.

51
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,660
Hello! Should I smack 
you with my socks?

52
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,180
It's barely been sixty 
days since she's left college.

53
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,380
And you're already pining for her.

54
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,900
From the looks of it, you'll 
be doomed by the end of the semester.

55
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,150
I'm not like the other 
hopeless romantics.

56
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,460
Who brood and cry

57
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,420
I will end up with Mridula.

58
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,280
She's your future sister-in-law 
and my girlfriend.

59
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,640
We've been together 
for twelve years Puggi...

60
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
Almost our entire schooling

61
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
Pishorilal Chamandas may just 
be a school-college for you guys.

62
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,120
For me it was a shrine.

63
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,200
The love temple.

64
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,800
Mr. Drama! She hasn't 
moved to another country.

65
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,920
Her new college is just an hour away.

66
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,120
In order to close 
the distance between us,

67
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
I'll need a twenty lac cheque.

68
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,080
And i'm just a poor little boy who 
will never be able to afford the fees.

69
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,440
These Barriers!

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hello Mr.! 
Do you think this is a charity show?

71
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,480
Would you like to 
get an award kind sir?

72
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,360
Get away from the gate!

73
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,080
Even their gatekeeper 
looks down on us here.

74
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,440
The day I enroll in this college, 
the very same day...

75
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,040
...I'll take a smiling 
selfie with you, right here.

76
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,400
Ok sure! And the day that 
happens i'll shave off my moustache.

77
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,080
Remove your hand.

78
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,680
Selfie with me, huh!

79
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,560
Lets go!

80
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
Wow! St. Teresa.

81
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
If your'e planning to mortgage 
your house then do let me know.

82
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,200
My uncle will get you a great deal.

83
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,430
Yeah sure, mock me all you want.

84
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,720
The day's yours...

85
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
but I'll seize the year.

86
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,020
You fool!

87
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,600
Don't try to be over smart.

88
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,000
You better watch out.

89
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,360
I've applied in 
the sports quota Puggi!

90
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:33,950
Hello.

91
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,110
Hello.

92
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,670
Oh Migh! You all look so lovely 
this fine morning.

93
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,920
Madam! Did you'll 
tie the knot last night?

94
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,550
Oh god. How many times should I say this? 
Get this cleared the previous evening.

95
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,150
You continue please.

96
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,790
Good morning dear students and our....

97
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,990
Teachers!

98
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,470
You think you'll are here for a party?

99
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,110
Please stand up. Show some respect.

100
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,270
Our respected teachers!

101
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,150
And once again eight colleges 
of Dehradhun and Mussoorie...

102
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,950
will be competing against each other 
for the Dinity Cup

103
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,790
DIGNITY! DIGNITY CUP!

104
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,510
Yes! Exactly that Cup. 
The competition has been announced.

105
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,590
Hello.

106
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,350
Hello.

107
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,990
The rats have nibbled 
on the wires once again.

108
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,870
Get my special mic.

109
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,030
Someone get it.

110
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,710
Yes...

111
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,110
And this year...

112
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,150
we have to show our rival college,

113
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,270
Ghamshyam College, that 
this year we won't be the last team.

114
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,470
This year, we will be SECOND LAST!

115
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:47,030
ALL TOGETHER! Praise the lord...

116
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,790
Praise the Lord!

117
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,270
And Rohan all our 
hopes are in you now.

118
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,590
All together! Three cheers for Rohan!

119
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,150
- Hip hip 
- HOORAY!

120
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,550
- Hip hip

121
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,150
- Hip hip 
- HOORAY!

122
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,430
Come on Rohan, let's get them.

123
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,310
Get him.

124
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,270
Let's go, very good.

125
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,950
Quick! Quick!

126
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,470
YAY!

127
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,670
Yay, Rohan.

128
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,710
Go Go Go Abhishek...

129
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,110
Take down four guys. Let's go!

130
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,110
- Yes Puggi! Look left. 
- Come sweety come.

131
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,590
You fool not my left, your left.

132
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,270
Puggi, here. Catch.

133
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,470
Yes... Get in!

134
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,110
ABU!!

135
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,950
What are you guys doing.

136
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,870
Great! You guys should 
join ballroom dancing.

137
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,230
Wow... such graceful movements.

138
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,990
Get him Abu.

139
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,710
Choke him. Sit on him.

140
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,510
Yes!

141
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,790
I'm telling you guys, follow my lead.

142
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,190
What are you doing Rohan... 
Why didn't you catch him!

143
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,710
What do you mean by that?

144
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,510
Are you guys playing 
Kabaddi or is this tug of war?

145
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,910
That you'll just hold me 
but not pull.

146
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,110
You said it right!

147
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,510
In the name of defenders 
they are just a bunch of duffers

148
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,110
I've left it coach.

149
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,190
You can't blame the darkness if 
you choose to keep your eyes shut.

150
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,030
You're right...

151
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,150
Wait a sec, 
are you telling me off or them?

152
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,710
Sir Mridula was right.

153
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,630
The real world is 
outside this college!

154
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,270
Then go... Mr. Romeo... You're Juliet 
is waiting for you in that college

155
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,270
Hey! Stop it.

156
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,430
Stop it.

157
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,550
AH! AH! I'm dead.

158
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,630
You guys are going to kill me. 
Kill me!

159
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,070
You fools...

160
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,950
even if you show half 
this enthusiasm on the field...

161
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,470
then you could not only 
compete you could actually win.

162
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,270
Get me a cold bottle... a hot bottle.

163
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,670
PLEASE HELP!

164
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,710
Helping. Now repeat Kamdev 
mantra (prayer) after me

165
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,390
and in sharp 5 days, Johnny 
will fall and call... I love you Mary.

166
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,070
No. It's Jenny. Not Johnny.

167
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,670
Whatever I say, you say.

168
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,710
Now close all your eyes

169
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,510
and repeat.

170
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,110
Kaamdev Kaam Vasham

171
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,790
Kaamdev kaam vasan

172
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,710
Amukshay karaey har dum..

173
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,270
Amukshay karey hrudhummm..

174
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,150
What happened?

175
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,230
What happened?

176
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,190
My spiritual instinct says, 
you had a bad day

177
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,310
My spiritual you bad.

178
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,550
The red envelope on the 
table looks auspicious for you.

179
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,350
Table... auspicious.. you?

180
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,310
Yes Yes. Go ahead. Pick it up!

181
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,270
Yes Yes. ahead. Up.

182
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,550
My scholarship application?

183
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,470
Read it! Go Ahead

184
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,750
Read. Go.

185
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,070
I don't believe this.

186
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,350
Aunty!

187
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,990
I go into St. Teresa.

188
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,590
Sports scholarship!

189
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,910
Amen!

190
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,820
Amen

191
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,910
You're a fool!

192
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,590
You're a--

193
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,710
Careful, you'll drop her.

194
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,310
Sports scholarship! I'm so happy!

195
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,470
I'll see you'll later!

196
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,390
Where are you going?

197
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,990
To tell Mridula.

198
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,110
You just wait and watch... 
Mridula will be his key to success.

199
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,430
Can you please write it down.

200
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,110
Sorry.

201
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,110
Son, i've got an expensive 
main door built for the house.

202
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,390
Just to see it, why don't you 
try using it at least once in a while.

203
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,830
Next time for sure Aunty! Sorry!

204
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,830
Where do you think you're going?

205
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,110
We'll take that selfie in the evening.

206
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,630
Mridula?

207
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,550
No Mridula here bro. 
Is she a teacher?

208
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,310
No, I meant.. Mridula Chawla..

209
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,590
Do you mean Mia Chawla?

210
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,470
Dude! Her real name's Mridula.

211
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,870
Check the audi. 
Her comp try outs are on.

212
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,690
Mridula?

213
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,130
CUT!

214
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,970
Cut the sound.

215
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,290
What's wrong Mikey baby?

216
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,090
Are you ill?

217
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,890
Haven't slept enough...

218
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,490
or did your girl dump 
you for someone else?

219
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,090
Huh?

220
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,650
Huh?

221
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,730
Why is the tempo so fast?

222
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,570
Shreya, this has always 
been the original speed.

223
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,730
Who's on speed, I know.

224
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,570
Now shut up and take it from the top.

225
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,100
She's good han.

226
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,610
MRIDULA!

227
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,730
Rohan?

228
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,890
Okay! Who's the duffer now? Huh?

229
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,770
Er... Sorry. I was just 
calling out to my girlfriend.

230
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,050
Wa- wait, wait, wait, wait.

231
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,730
Aren't you that Pishori boy?

232
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,290
You're here for a donation?

233
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,970
I'm a new student. I've just enrolled.

234
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,370
Wow! Teresa's standards 
have really dropped.

235
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,930
Yes of course! 
If you're the one setting it.

236
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,330
WHAT?

237
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,770
The tempo isn't fast! You're slow.

238
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,930
Oh really? 
Why don't you come and show us then?

239
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,650
Mikey... the same tempo, please!

240
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,010
Send the bill to my dad.

241
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,610
Subway! In the college? 
Are you kidding?

242
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,890
It's just a college Ro.

243
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,970
Why are you overreacting?

244
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,410
Your cold coffee..

245
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,370
Ro that's a Frappe.

246
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,770
Ok so Ro...no offense han...

247
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,570
But... my dad owns a 
couple of petrol stations...

248
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,290
so I managed to get here.

249
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,370
But you... Here?

250
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,690
Sports scholarship.

251
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,970
Ahhhh!

252
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,170
Okay! What's the deal with her?

253
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,210
Her!

254
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,210
What are you looking at?

255
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,810
It's best to avoid her.

256
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,690
Hmm.

257
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,330
Have you noticed the College 
Founder statue with the broken hand?

258
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,610
Last week some guy parked 
his car in Shreya's spot.

259
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,890
Woah!! Then why do 
you'll tolerate her?

260
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,810
Because her dad is 
the college trustee!

261
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:29,890
That explains it.

262
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,530
By the way Ro...the girls here...

263
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,290
way out of your league.

264
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,450
so don't try too hard... ok?

265
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,570
Ok but... why would 
I approach anyone else?

266
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,410
In fact you know what?

267
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,490
We should pair up in the 
dance competition and take her down.

268
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,130
What Say?

269
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,290
You know what? 
I have a math class...

270
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,050
I'll see you. Okay Ro?

271
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,730
Mridula?

272
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:07,850
Hey!

273
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:11,770
What's wrong?

274
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,130
Why do you sound so different?

275
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,370
Not different.

276
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,650
I've just evolved.

277
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,730
Life does not always 
stay the same Rohan.

278
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,170
We have to grow up sometime. 
Right?

279
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,890
But the only reason i'm here...

280
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,130
...is for you.

281
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,170
Did I ask you to?

282
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,810
Listen!

283
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,970
I'd kind of respect you more 
if you did it for yourself Ro.

284
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,730
I don't need this right now.

285
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,130
I'm here to make something 
of myself...

286
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,090
not for anyone else.

287
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,370
Mridula, i'm here for...

288
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,410
It's MIA!

289
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,770
Bye Ro.

290
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,410
Bro. Get the dip!

291
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,010
George Wickham!

292
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,090
Who's that?

293
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,570
You see, If Mr. 
Darcey does everything for Elizabeth

294
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,810
...and she turns around and says 
"thank you but... I'm not interested ".

295
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,890
It means her agenda has shifted 
from Mr. Darcey to Wickham

296
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,170
Guys... Mia is just confused, okay.

297
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,050
You continue hopping on rooftops...

298
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,410
But she has taken the real leap!

299
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,450
Good morning students!

300
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,210
GOOD MORNING SIR!

301
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,450
It gives me great pleasure to announce

302
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,690
that this years sports team for 
the Dignity Cup has been finally...

303
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,330
- Shortlisted. 
- What?

304
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,530
Shortlisted.

305
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,010
CHOSEN! The team has been chosen!

306
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,410
DIGNITY! DIGNITY! DIGNITY!

307
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,810
And the team will be lead 
by this years Sports Captain—

308
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,050
Who has been our lucky 
mascot and strength.

309
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,490
Dude!

310
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,570
You're the guy right...

311
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,730
that had a dance off with Shreya?

312
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,090
Uh... yeah! But—

313
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,690
Put it there.

314
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,050
Respect bro!

315
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,130
Thanks.

316
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,130
He has also won the trophy 
for the 'Best player'.

317
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,890
She seems really crazy.

318
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,090
I should know. She's my sister.

319
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,610
Who has won Student of 
the Year title twice in a row.

320
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,410
But well... 
i'm sure she has a heart of gold.

321
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,450
Chill bro...

322
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,050
--- the star amongst stars... 
the one and only...

323
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,210
- Manav! 
- Who?

324
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,370
Manav Singh Randhawa.

325
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,170
MANAV SINGH RANDHAWA!

326
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,170
MANAV! MANAV! MANAV! MANAV!

327
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,690
Who's Manav?

328
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,770
That's my cue.

329
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,690
MANAV! MANAV! MANAV! MANAV!

330
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,850
MANAV! MANAV! MANAV! MANAV!

331
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:28,130
MANAV! MANAV! MANAV! MANAV!

332
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,010
Duffer! You're trying 
to impress the wrong girl.

333
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,770
You're not my type.

334
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,970
Not me... coach Kuljeet!

335
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,850
The college coach buddy!

336
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,210
She is really into fair boys.

337
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,690
Show her this.

338
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:55,930
My bone?

339
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,050
Your Tricep buddy!

340
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,690
Strong boys, are her weakness.

341
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,090
If you impress her, you can 
compete for the student trophy...

342
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,810
and then Mia will 
be all like...

343
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,770
Rohan... I love you Rohan!

344
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,490
One second, why are you—

345
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,770
I'm just feeling bad for you!

346
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,330
And our issue is 
still not sorted, okay!

347
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,370
DUFFER!

348
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,410
Ahhh...

349
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,210
Seriously ma'am...

350
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,170
seriously!

351
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,610
I was the best sportsman of Pishori .

352
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,130
You need to look into 
my achievements more clearly.

353
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,690
Anyway, what do you think?

354
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,850
Will I be able to compete for Student?

355
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,650
Will you allow me?

356
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,810
Oh! Hi sir, good morning.

357
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,210
Baby your coffee.

358
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,170
Thanks babe.

359
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:38,890
Ma'am

360
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,370
Ma'am's ma'am.

361
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,810
Duffer!

362
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,450
Great! But late.

363
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,050
You've missed the deadline.

364
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,130
You were competing 
with amateurs to this day.

365
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,570
Your a senior now...

366
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,130
You're going to compete 
with seniors now.

367
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,290
Get It?

368
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,010
Yeah.

369
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,450
Our college holds the record 
time for the 100 meters race!

370
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,530
11.6 Seconds!

371
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,130
Held by Manav Singh Randhawa!

372
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,410
But this year, 
this year we're going to beat that.

373
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,650
Can we do that boys?

374
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,370
Yes Coach.

375
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,330
Can we do it boys?

376
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,410
Yes Coach!

377
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,970
You're going to run in these shoes?

378
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,170
Yes ma'am.

379
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,770
On your marks...

380
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,450
Set...

381
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:37,730
GO!

382
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,930
And it's a new record.

383
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,130
Dude! I think we all need 
to change our shoes, not you.

384
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,570
Thanks.

385
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,170
Epic stuff man!

386
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,050
I'll see you soon.

387
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,610
Ok. So which tattoo do you want? 
My treat!

388
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,370
Uhhh..

389
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,130
Tattoo's are not really my scene.

390
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,330
I mean you like one thing today... 
you hate it tomorrow!

391
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,530
Tattoo's stay forever.

392
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,450
So look for something 
that you'll always like.

393
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,850
Ok.

394
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,690
Ok.. So which country 
would you like to visit?

395
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,050
My treat!

396
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,570
More than seeing the whole world,

397
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,650
I want the world to see me Ro.

398
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,730
Once I win the dance competition...

399
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,770
...then there'll 
be like no turning back.

400
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,370
I'll make all my dreams come true.

401
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,210
Even I have just one dream.

402
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,610
What?

403
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,290
Student of the Year?

404
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,650
To make all your dreams come true.

405
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,410
It was their day.

406
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,650
But we'll seize the year.

407
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,170
I promise you.

408
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,180
What's your height?

409
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,020
I'm 5'10.

410
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,380
And weight?

411
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,820
Ok relax ma'am.

412
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,220
I'm the king of Kabaddi.

413
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,820
It's really no big deal.

414
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,140
This isn't track and field.

415
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,420
It's a completely different sport.

416
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,580
Better watch out.

417
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,220
Come.

418
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,820
She's just messing with your head bro.

419
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,980
If you prove yourself 
in Kabaddi then you're in the team.

420
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,180
And in this event...

421
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,940
Kabaddi is king.

422
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,540
So do not screw up.

423
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,180
Don't worry...

424
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,380
I have my lucky shoes.

425
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,820
Get over them man.

426
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,100
Lets go!

427
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
On the whistle!

428
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,580
Okay guys concentrate.

429
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,300
Get him! Get him!

430
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,980
Okay next raid... Rohan.

431
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,940
Okay.

432
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,500
Come on, Rohan.

433
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,380
Get him.

434
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,780
Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi

435
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,900

436
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,940
Left! Left!

437
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,580
Move.

438
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,260
- You ok? 
- Yeah.

439
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,340
Good play.

440
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,460
- You sure? 
- Yeah.

441
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,500
Sorry man... Sorry

442
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,820
Thanks.

443
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,380
Hurting?

444
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,860
Ro, Is it hurting?

445
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,620
What?

446
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,700
Can you hear?

447
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,580
Huh?

448
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,060
YUCK!

449
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,820
Take it from the left...

450
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,820
Hey!

451
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,940
Sorry bro!

452
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,020
You're out of the team 
because of me.

453
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,220
It's okay man. You guys are superb.

454
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,540
You're a total kabaddi pro.

455
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,300
Team bro!

456
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm nothing without the others!

457
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,820
It's all team!

458
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,500
Anyways, ice it and get some rest.

459
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,380
I'll see you.

460
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,460
And listen...

461
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,900
tonight, Jeffrey's!

462
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,260
Let me make this up to you.

463
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,380
Jeffrey's?

464
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,020
It's a new nightclub, on Rajpur road.

465
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,380
It's my birthday tomorrow.

466
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,220
And you both are invited.

467
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,900
And it's a Superhero theme party. 
So dress cool.

468
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,940
Superhero theme party?

469
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,820
I'll come as Flying Jatt. 
(indian superhero)

470
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,820
NO!

471
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,580
Mia please take care of him.

472
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,700
Yes... of course

473
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,900
Lets go guys?

474
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,620
I'll see you'll later.

475
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,620
He's a really cool guy!

476
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,100
Wow! Nice car!

477
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,700
Whose is it?

478
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,500
Uh... It's mine!

479
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,820
I didn't like the 
color so I rent it out.

480
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,300
It's actually Manav's car.

481
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,820
Look at you Mr. Dapper, found 
a babe so forgot your friends?

482
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,420
Why are you wearing a bed sheet?

483
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,180
Abu!... It's the rich boy party look!

484
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,420
Hey Mridula! 
You're dressed as Bappi Lahri?

485
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,940
He said it's a singles 
night at the club today...

486
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,660
...but there's a private party inside.

487
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,020
Whose party is it?

488
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,580
It's my friend's party. Manav.

489
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,100
A friend's friend is also a friend!

490
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,260
Get us in brother!

491
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,100
Er.. how can I?—

492
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,500
Rohan! Let's go?

493
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,940
Rohan, wait listen please—

494
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,380
Let's go home guys... 
No ones going to get us in.

495
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,620
Yeah, from London?

496
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,860
Hi Manav!

497
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,580
Hey! you guys made it! 
Hows it going?

498
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,140
Hey Manav, Happy Birthday!

499
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,700
Thank you so much!

500
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,940
Hey! Rohan's friends right?

501
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,140
Why are you guys standing 
like a valet service?

502
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:04,820
Come in!

503
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,860
It's a private party 
of someone called Manasvi.

504
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
So we can't get in.

505
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,060
Rohan has got all you guys in.

506
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,980
But what about costumes?

507
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,540
We are not dressed.

508
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,100
That's ok...

509
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,660
We'll go as regular people. Superheros 
need to rescue someone right?

510
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,700
So cute!

511
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,900
I told you Abhishek?

512
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,620
The boy may have left Pishori

513
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,260
but Pishori hasn't left the boy.

514
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,660
Hit me!

515
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,220
Bro, what's in the brown bottle?

516
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,180
Vinegar

517
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:45,900
We'll have it if its free

518
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,900

519
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,220

00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,860
Happy birthday Manasvi!

546
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,620
Happy birthday to you...

547
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,020
Happy birthday dear Manasvi...

548
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,340
Happy birthday to you.

549
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,460
You were born in the zoo...

550
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,820
With monkeys and donkeys like you...

551
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,260
And when your girlfriend dumps you...

552
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,340
We will do you!

553
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,860
Lets go guys... 
That's enough.. Get out of here.

554
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,340
Before the cake cutting ... No way!

555
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,540
We'll cut a cake outside. Lets go!

556
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,700
Oh hello! You box.

557
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,500
Show some respect! We are the guest.

558
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,540
Whose guests?

559
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,020
Manav didn't invite you guys.

560
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,260
We're Rohan's friends! 
And Rohan is Manasvi's friend.

561
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,940
That makes us friends too.

562
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,700
You green lump of slime! 
Wait! Let me show you.

563
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,420
Fight! Fight! Fight!

564
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,380
Are you'll crazy?

565
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,420
Leave him!

566
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,580
Come on!

567
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,940
Leave it! Leave!

568
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,060
MANAV!

569
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,380
That's great Rohan! 
Just stand there and stare?

570
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,620
Why don't you go join the crowd?

571
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,220
You got us in and that's why we came. 
Isn't it true?

572
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,900
Guys I didn't—

573
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,260
I knew it! Chameleon!

574
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,340
Such a shame.

575
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,380
Guys stop it... Please.

576
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,300
Just leave!

577
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,340
Rohan! Tell them!

578
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,940
That's just great.

579
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,820
If I had a good come back I 
would have said it just about now.

580
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,660
I'll think about 
it and text you later.

581
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,220
Such a shallow guy.

582
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,860
Let's go.

583
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,700
He's not our friend anymore.

584
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,340
Let's go.

585
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,820
- Mia? Listen to me! 
- You know what Rohan?

586
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,020
Make up your mind! 
Either you're here or there.

587
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,420
Mia I am with you.

588
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,260
Listen...I didn't get them in—

589
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,340
Then who did?

590
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,500
Hey Duffer!

591
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,100
That's my spot.

592
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,580
Oh! Reserved for ladies? Is it?

593
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,700
You've messed with 
the wrong girl. DUFFER!

594
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,420
The leading economic 
indicators are income and wages...

595
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,660
- Unemployment rate.. 
- ROHAN! ROHAN! Your bike.

596
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,980
Just come. Come fast.

597
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,660
Now here's a lady-like bike. 
Park here now.

598
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,820
Princess!

599
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,820
Er.. Sir tea?

600
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,620
It's getting cold.

601
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,020
Mr.Gujral, please talk.

602
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,020
You see normally... 
I ignore all her childish tantrums.

603
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,660
I'm confused about what to do. 
On one hand your son Manav.

604
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,340
He's the pride of St. Teresa.

605
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,500
and her?

606
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,020
She's his--

607
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,620
Uhh... Sister sir.

608
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,380
SIBLING!

609
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,820
Sibling sir.

610
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,820
Totally opposite.

611
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:09,900
Manav--

612
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,140
Can you understand 
where I'm coming from.

613
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,140
Sir.

614
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,820
Sir-- Mr. Randhava please--

615
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:39,060
The next time, I get the 
smallest complaint against you...

616
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,020
I'll break your face.

617
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,420
Your damages will be taken care of.

618
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,820
You're leaning on the wrong leg.

619
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,420
Shreya?

620
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,020
I know we hit it 
off on the wrong foot...

621
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,540
But you hate me that much?

622
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,100
Listen cant we-

623
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,980
Can't we just be friends?

624
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,500
The dance competition is in four days.

625
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,980
Don't go soft now.

626
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,700
Or I'll loose the thrill 
of taking you down.

627
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,420
Bro she crossed the line 
and you're on a guilt trip?

628
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,220
Just chill out man.

629
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,460
She wants to join some dance 
school in the UK, for two years.

630
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,620
No wonder she's taking 
the competition so seriously.

631
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,100
Dad has allowed her to participate only 
on one condition. It has to be with me.

632
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,260
Whoa!

633
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:04,940
So...

634
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,300
That means... We are going 
to be rivals in the dance competition?

635
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,940
Aha... But dude...

636
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:11,220
Word of caution...

637
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,500
my doctor has advised 
me against losing.

638
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,140
Then you need to consult a new one.

639
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,450
Because Mia's dream 
is greater than your ego...

640
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,150
Which I will fulfill for her.

641
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,990
We'll win right?

642
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,110
Should I sign it off for you?

643
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,830
Yes please!

644
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,770
Good thing you cut 
your name short to Mia.

645
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,570
Mridula would have been complicated.

646
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,690
Ladies and gentlemen...

647
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,730
The judges have made their decision.

648
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:26,890
And the winners 
of the dance competition are...

649
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:30,970
Shreya and Manav!

650
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,770
Smile.

651
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,330
Mia?

652
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,690
Losing is not in my blood.

653
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,970
Rohan! 
The dean has called you.

654
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:45,370
Did you hit Manav Randhawa last night?

655
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,370
Yes sir...

656
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,290
But sir that happened 
outside college premises.

657
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,690
Does it really matter Rohan?

658
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:52,610
Outside.

659
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:53,530
Inside.

660
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,650
You know who his father is right?

661
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,010
Sir, I do... but he was 
with my girlfriend and--

662
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,210
I know!

663
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,770
But this issue has 
escalated to the board.

664
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,450
And I'm really helpless.

665
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:07,490
Here.

666
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,530
Your expulsion letter.

667
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:19,530
You've been thrown 
out of St.Teresa.

668
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,170
S-Sir... This is not fair.

669
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,450
I'm sorry.

670
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:53,290
Look i'm sorry ok.

671
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:54,690
But I had warned you...

672
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,370
I don't like to loose.

673
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,890
Listen! Why don't 
you get lost you cheat.

674
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:01,450
Cheat?

675
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:03,850
That's your come back?

676
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:05,490
Really?

677
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:08,290
What were you expecting?

678
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:12,770
You'll get in here with a 
charity scholarship and fit right in?

679
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:14,930
Just look at him guys.

680
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:19,050
The loser of Pishori... is 
out to become the stud of Teresa.

681
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,130
Did you forget your place.

682
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,330
What are you looking at?

683
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,970
I took pity on you and 
got you under my wing...

684
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,250
Invited you to my Birthday... 
included you in the team.

685
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,530
You know why?

686
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,450
Because you would have 
been a good sidekick.

687
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:43,450
But you were out to trample on me?

688
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,610
Teresa's champ!

689
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,170
Rohan Sachdev?

690
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,970
Why did you have to involve Mia?

691
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:00,770
Do you still think 
I had to do anything?

692
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,090
Bro, look at you.

693
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:05,690
And look at me.

694
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:09,530
She just chose man.

695
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:11,610
Fair and square.

696
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,050
Let go!

697
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:51,010
Let go!

698
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:50,450
Girlfriend in one hand 
and trophy in the other.

699
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,730
And this college as a backdrop.

700
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:55,370
That was your aim in life right?

701
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,930
But this is who you are... 
a small town boy.

702
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,610
Not Student...

703
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:13,890
Loser of the Year!

704
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,520
Come on Rohaaaannn!

705
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,240
Come on you can do it.

706
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,760
Come on Ro!

707
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:15,680
Not Student... Loser of the Year!

708
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,240
Let it be.

709
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,280
Before cleaning all this up, 
clear your head.

710
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,400
Rohan!

711
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,280
My son, she was trying 
to find her own self.

712
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,640
She wanted to do a lot of things.

713
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,760
But... what do you want to do?

714
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,560
Have you thought about that?

715
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,800
What do you call "Talent" in english?

716
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,080
Talent.

717
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,880
Work on your talent son... 
destiny will fall in it's place.

718
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,480
What had you called me?

719
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,280
Loser of the year?

720
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,640
But the year isn't over yet my friend.

721
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,080
Look Hero...

722
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,200
What had to happen, happened!

723
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,280
And to be honest, it shouldn't have.

724
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,160
So for that...I'm sorry.

725
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,040
And anyway...

726
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,520
Let's just move on buddy.

727
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,920
What's the connection 
between us anyhow?

728
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,200
The connection is made my friend.

729
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,200
Which can't be broken now.

730
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,440
Mia will always remain 
my ex girlfriend.

731
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,560
And you...

732
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,000
The Stud of Teresa...

733
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,400
...who will lose 
the Diginity trophy...

734
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,520
...to Pishorilal Chamandas College.

735
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,200
And...

736
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,840
...the Student of 
the Year title to me.

737
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,640
I've won two years in a row buddy.

738
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,040
I'm going to get the hat-trick too.

739
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,400
I had just one dream in my life.

740
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,200
You snatched from me.

741
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,480
So I have to return the favor, right?

742
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,280
I guess after my trashing...

743
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,800
...you've lost your mind 
and forgotten your place.

744
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,680
It's not about that anymore.

745
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,000
It's now about my self respect.

746
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,320
And the day I get into 
your side of the court...

747
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,360
I'll strip you off your pride and 
you wouldn't even know what hit you.

748
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,520
The day was yours,

749
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,760
But I'll seize the year!

750
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,000
I knew it from the very beginning...

751
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,200
That after going on this sabbatical 
my Rohan would definitely come home.

752
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,840
Now that you're back, take over your 
team and get back to your captaincy.

753
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,400
No Ma'am, 
Let Abhishek remain the captain.

754
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,400
I just want to stay in 
the team and compete for Student.

755
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,960
Son, think of it this way, 
you weren't expelled.

756
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,320
You were sent back to us for a reason.

757
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,200
Now with your help, 
we'll thrash Ghanshyam.

758
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,200
Hey! looked all over for you.

759
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,520
I needed a favor.

760
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,560
Just as you got Rohan 
expelled from college...

761
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,440
...can you get Manav out too?

762
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,600
What?

763
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,360
I'll pay you!

764
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,360
Cash!

765
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,640
I didn't get Rohan expelled.

766
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,320
Of course! you just betrayed him.

767
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,880
Cheated me.

768
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:14,800
Right?

769
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,120
Oh I'm so sorry.

770
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,920
You got all that you 
desired because of me.

771
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,680
And you won the trophy.

772
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,600
Tch... tch... tch...

773
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,120
With your bloody charity?

774
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,120
Your life must be so difficult right?

775
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,560
You're just a poor little rich girl, 
who kind of has a problem with everything.

776
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,440
Wow!

777
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,520
You have no clue what you did. Right?

778
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,760
Listen, I know exactly 
what I've done. Okay?

779
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,520
How I did it was wrong.

780
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,040
And I regret only that.

781
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:44,800
Cool?

782
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,520
Well... even I have a regret...

783
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,320
That you couldn't win the trophy.

784
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:50,960
So here!

785
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,560
To the best sister-in-law.

786
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,240
Of the week.

787
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,840
Puggi your boxers have a hole!

788
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,120
Puggi your boxers have a hole!

789
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,960
Puggi your boxers have a hole!

790
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,800
Romeo! Take a number 
and sit in the reserve.

791
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,160
I'll call you when it's your turn.

792
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,040
What are you looking at?

793
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,760
It's your 'Captains' order.

794
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,040
Come on guys, 
What are you'll looking at me for?

795
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,200
You'll want to sit there too?

796
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,000
Practice your in-turn out-turn.

797
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,120
Come on.

798
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:48,880
Come on!

799
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,240
Let's go... 
or I'll send you'll out too.

800
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,280
Nice College. NOT!

801
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,760
Come here fast.

802
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,560
Chill!

803
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,920
Couriers are expensive so I thought...

804
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,880
Ohh...k...

805
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,520
Look!

806
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,200
I know it's not easy.

807
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,200
Mutual disrespect and all that.

808
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,280
But the common point is that...

809
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,760
...as cheated and hurt as you are...

810
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,240
I am too!

811
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,200
Because even I didn't know!

812
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,640
But now I know...

813
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,360
...that there's only one way 
to get back at Manav and Mia.

814
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,840
Dehradhun's biggest dance competition.

815
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,120
Even bigger than college one!

816
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,000
Pair up with me.

817
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,120
Your talent and my hard work.

818
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,280
We'll win it and show those cheats!

819
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,160
What say?

820
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,440
Whatever.

821
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,920
Hey Juliet!

822
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,640
This is perfect.

823
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,760
Take this loser's 
help to become a winner.

824
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,200
Go for it! Go for it!

825
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,080
Loser?

826
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,080
Really?

827
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,000
Because he trusted someone blindly?

828
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,280
And gave up everything for her?

829
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,760
And what about the 
fact that he betrayed us?

830
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,880
What was our fault?

831
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,320
You saw it all at 
Jeffrey's that night right?

832
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,520
Dorks! That was all my doing.

833
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,320
I used Rohan's name 
and sent you'll in.

834
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:41,200
You'll ruined a life long friendship 
over few minutes of misunderstanding?

835
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,080
What a line, anyway...

836
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,760
Loser! Loser! Loser! Loser!

837
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,160
Duffer!

838
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,040
Idiot!

839
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,960
I made a mistake by coming here.

840
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,120
Abhishek, 
I think I have a weird cramp.

841
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,680
Please let Rohan play instead of me?

842
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:18,080
Come on guys! Take your positions.

843
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,840
Let's begin with defense practice.

844
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,080
Come on!

845
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,560
Come on, let's play.

846
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,480
Come on boys!

847
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,120
Thigh hold.

848
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,840
- What the hell is she doing? 
- What is she doing?

849
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,280
You're just taking 
advantage of us since we forgave you.

850
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,280
Out of all the places 
you get us to Jeffrey's?

851
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,080
Let's stay together or 
we'll get beaten up again.

852
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,240
If you have to prove something, 
prove it to yourself.

853
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,880
Not to anyone else.

854
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,600
Especially to the both of them.

855
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,800
You're real competition is the mirror.

856
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,840
Sorry. Can't hear you.

857
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,840
He still affects you so much?

858
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,080
Manav tell me the truth ...

859
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,920
Do you love me or is this 
all just to teach Rohan a lesson?

860
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,040
I love this small 
town girl insecurity.

861
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,160
Yes! Yes! I know. We've 
got only 5 minutes to go!

862
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,280
Come! Lets go!

863
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,560
Cake?

864
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,760
Rusty's birthday.

865
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,320
Want some?

866
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,440
Man! You do need 
to get some friends.

867
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,160
And by friends...

868
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,800
I don't mean Rohan.

869
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,440
All the attention 
that he's giving you...

870
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,240
I hope you know why.

871
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,200
Just to get to me.

872
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,480
Attention?

873
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,560
One must respect women.

874
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,680
Because even dogs can give attention.

875
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,680
Come my boy. Come! Come! Come!

876
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,960
Sit! Wait! Stay!

877
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,800
Happy birthday to me...

878
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,520
Happy birthday to me...

879
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,960
Happy birthday dear Shreya...

880
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,040
Happy birthday to me!

881
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,640
Thank you! Thank you everyone!

882
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,560
You are all 
here for my birthday?

883
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,280
Really means a lot guys!

884
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,760
This first bite...

885
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,680
For my mom...

886
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,560
Then dad...

887
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,120
Manav who I hate...

888
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,010
And finally! My main man.

889
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,730
Come here Rusty. Come here!

890
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,560
Happy birthday! Shreya!

891
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,600
Happy birthday to you.

892
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,240
Happy birthday dear Shreya...

893
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:29,040
Happy birthday to you.

894
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,400
What did you think?

895
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,600
If you didn't mention it, 
I wouldn't find out?

896
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,680
But how did you find out?

897
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,640
I had sent you a friend 
request on facebook.

898
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:37,760
Such a dead birthday?

899
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,400
I mean how come no 
big Jeffrey's party?

900
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:44,000
Dad was insisting 
but I didn't want to.

901
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:46,520
Come.

902
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,000
Thank you duffer.

903
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,240
But why don't you 
say something to her?

904
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,480
You have every right to.

905
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,720
What can I say that 
she already doesn't know?

906
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,880
Insulting Mia is like 
insulting my love for her.

907
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,560
Which I can never possibly do.

908
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,160
People can say whatever 
they want Shreya...

909
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,960
but twelve years of love... 
doesn't turn to hate in four days.

910
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,440
Twelve years of love 
versus four days of hate?

911
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,160
That's sick!

912
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,760
Sick? Who is sick?

913
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,240
Dude!

914
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,440
I've surely fallen for you.

915
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,680
My tweleve-year timer starts, NOW!

916
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,440
Well, I'm serious!

917
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,320
The way you have loved Mia...

918
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,840
If someone gives me 
ten even percent of that...

919
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,960
just ten percent of that...

920
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,840
then i'll never let go of him.

921
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,080
What?

922
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,240
Do you understand life long?

923
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:21,840
When you're 91 years old and lying 
in a hospital on your death bed...

924
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:27,760
you won't have your uncle and aunt or your 
lame Pishori friends holding your hand...

925
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,240
But instead just one person..

926
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,600
Nurse Nancy?

927
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,640
It's confirmed! You are a duffer.

928
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,480
Dude!

929
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,080
I'm so so so happy!

930
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,440
You know... the stupid toy 
that you win in a cornflakes box...

931
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,000
I've never even won that!

932
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,840
- What? Really? 
- Yes!

933
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,440
The entire house is filled 
with Manav's trophies.

934
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,840
But now...

935
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,360
Here!

936
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,920
What? Why are you giving it to me?

937
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:41,840
It's yours.

938
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,040
If I take it home... 
It will create a scene.

939
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,680
What is it? 
Where did it come from?

940
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,120
You're lying and all that drama.

941
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,040
I mean but--

942
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,680
You've worked so hard for it.

943
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,080
No Rohan.

944
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,760
It won't matter to anybody!

945
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,520
The men in my house?

946
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,240
They're not like you.

947
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,600
And your Mom?

948
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,280
While giving birth to me she...

949
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,440
Dad calls me 'Jinxed'.

950
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,960
Now you understand why 
we don't celebrate my birthday.

951
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,840
Mia?

952
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,680
I'm not with Manav anymore Ro.

953
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:01,960
Wow!

954
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,000
Now?

955
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,560
I'm really sorry Ro!

956
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,400
I had no idea Manav 
would behave like that.

957
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,960
Please! 
Let me handle her!

958
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:12,240
- You know what I can't believe-- 
- Can we talk someplace else?

959
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:19,800
Please.

960
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,280
Yeah. Sure.

961
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,000
Couldn't you just send a text message?

962
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,040
Ok guys. 
This is really awkward.

963
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,480
So I'm just gonna 
explain the rules once.

964
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,960
Please no one is going to cry 
or scream... are we clear?

965
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,080
- Shreya please. I don't-- 
- Why are you looking at me?

966
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,080
Why would I cry?

967
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,000
She'll cry.

968
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,080
Drama queen!

969
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:47,320
Shreya...

970
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,000
Please... Calm down...

971
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:50,760
Please...

972
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,000
Ro...

973
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,000
I was wrong.

974
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,280
And you were right.

975
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,720
I was just looking 
out for myself and...

976
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,200
I got carried away.

977
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,440
Oh my god!

978
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,040
What I did to you...

979
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,800
And what I lost in return—

980
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,040
Oh my god! 
Are you serious?

981
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Look!

982
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,160
I know I've lost you Ro.

983
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,960
If you don't want 
to get back with me...

984
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,000
Don't.

985
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,040
If you don't want to talk to me...

986
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:28,720
Don't.

987
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,080
Ok cool! 
So you're done right?

988
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,040
Come Rohan! Let's go.

989
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,000
Shreya please.

990
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,560
Please.

991
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,840
Continue.

992
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,360
But please..

993
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,080
Don't hate me Ro. 
Just...

994
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,600
Please don't hate me!

995
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,240
Rohan... 
Don't fall for this.

996
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,600
This is all just a game.

997
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,720
Shreya please... 
I still love him.

998
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,120
And guess what? 
So do I!

999
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,760
What?

1000
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,440
You had your chance 
and you messed it up.

1001
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,480
Now its my turn.

1002
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:55,880
It's fair!

1003
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,400
Shreya stop behaving like a child--

1004
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,920
Yes! 
And you're being very mature right?

1005
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,080
Rohan- Manav-Rohan! 
Are you a girl or a shuttlecock?

1006
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,480
Rohan, you don't have 
to explain anything to her...

1007
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,840
You know what... Instead 
of sorry have some coffee!

1008
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,240
ARE YOU CRAZY? 
HAVE YOU TOTALLY LOST IT?

1009
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,240
Mia I'm so sorry... 
Are you ok?

1010
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,320
Did you burn your hand?

1011
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,640
Leave Shreya!

1012
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,320
I want to go to London...

1013
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,640
To a dance school.

1014
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,960
I've kept repeating myself...

1015
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,360
Don't you get it?

1016
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,400
Should I explain it 
to you another way?

1017
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,440
Ahhh... 
Excuse me sir!

1018
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,240
Sir... May I come in please?

1019
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,520
You?

1020
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,280
What has she done this time?

1021
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,080
This Sir!

1022
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,360
'Your Daughter' has done this.

1023
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:53,800
What is this?

1024
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,320
Sir, 'Your Daughter' 
won this trophy last night...

1025
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,960
'Your Daughter' isn't just the best 
dancer in Teresa... but of the entire city.

1026
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,120
I'm sure this must be a 
very proud moment for you...

1027
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,680
Isn't it sir?

1028
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,800
But can you believe it?

1029
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:13,040
She was afraid to tell you.

1030
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,320
But I told her sir...

1031
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,800
If your father feels so happy 
on his sons smallest achievements ...

1032
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:23,320
then just imagine...

1033
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,640
how happy he would feel 
for his daughter's first big win.

1034
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,080
Isn't it sir?

1035
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,960
Right sir! 
I'll make a move.

1036
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,120
Sorry to take your time.

1037
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,000
And Shreya...

1038
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,600
Congratulations!

1039
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,600
Sir I don't know about your son...

1040
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,760
But your daughter is incredible.

1041
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:31,160
Good Morning Students!

1042
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,400
Good Morning Sir!

1043
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,240
Being the official hosts 
of this great event...

1044
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,880
It gives me great 
pleasure to declare...

1045
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,320
The 29th... Annunal...

1046
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,800
Inter College... Dignity Cup...

1047
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,600
OPENNNNN!!

1048
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,000
The Dignity tournament 
will commence in one month .

1049
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,440
Ohhh! 
Manasvi?

1050
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,400
Happy birthday dear Manasvi.

1051
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,840
Happy birthday to you...

1052
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,480
Happy birthday to you...

1053
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,960
Ole oleole! 
How old is the diva now?

1054
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,320
Enjoy this moment for now!

1055
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,800
By the end of the competition you'll 
forget your name too.

1056
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:16,400
Awwwww...Manasvi is offended.

1057
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,040
What's the diva doing in that team?

1058
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,680
Do one thing, come on to our team.

1059
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,280
No one will tease you here.

1060
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:22,600
Go Puggi... 
Give him a hug.

1061
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,840
Come my baby doll.

1062
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,560
Awwwww.

1063
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,970
Wishing all the teams best of luck...

1064
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:33,680
May the best team win.

1065
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,880
Bro did you see his face?

1066
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,840
It turned this small?

1067
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,360
Who did that?

1068
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:41,400
Who did it?

1069
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,760
Bro, why are you hitting us?

1070
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:58,400
Hey...

1071
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,360
Abu, run.

1072
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,000
I'm sorry Ro!

1073
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,240
Please just forget about it.

1074
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,560
Rohan!

1075
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,760
Manav and the Teresa 
boys are beating Puggi.

1076
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,400
Go! Go!

1077
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:44,800
Go quick!

1078
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,520
Go!

1079
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,800
Come.

1080
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,680
Please let them go.

1081
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:13,600
Now do you remember my name?

1082
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,840
Did you recollect it?

1083
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,160
Hit him.

1084
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,960
Come on Rohan! 
Come on hit him!

1085
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,440
Rohan... Rohan stop.

1086
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:55,330
Stop son! Let go!

1087
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:57,360
Pull him away.

1088
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,360
Hi!

1089
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,560
Hi!

1090
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,200
How's he?

1091
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,600
He's got six stitches on his head.

1092
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,840
But the doctor says not to worry.

1093
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,560
Guys, anyone wants a coffee?

1094
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,080
- Yes i'd like a cappuc--... 
- NO!

1095
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,680
Nevermind...

1096
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,240
I've stopped drinking Coffee...

1097
01:41:58,440 --> 01:41:59,680
Too much caffeine.

1098
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:04,120
Listen Mia...

1099
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:07,280
I'm really so sorry... 
I was just being so stupid.

1100
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,840
You love him right?

1101
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,160
Love?

1102
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:24,720
It's a big word.

1103
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:29,440
But the way Rohan loves you...

1104
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,960
My love seems like 
a small schoolgirl crush.

1105
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,120
Summer love I guess.

1106
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,760
But Mia...

1107
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,680
If you try to hurt him again...

1108
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:48,960
I swear to god...

1109
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,200
I wont let you get away with it...

1110
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:51,280
nor this duffer!

1111
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,320
Great!

1112
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,800
Here!

1113
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,040
Don't blush.

1114
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,800
It's not for you, It's for Abhishek.

1115
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,160
He'll be fine.

1116
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,000
Shreya!

1117
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,360
Don't tell me!

1118
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,800
She ran away with the doctor?

1119
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:48,840
You ok?

1120
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,600
Thanks for talking to my dad.

1121
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,960
Thanks to you dad's 
sending me to London.

1122
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,280
What?

1123
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,960
To graduate from 
London School of Dance.

1124
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,520
That's great!

1125
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,520
Your dream!

1126
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Finally!

1127
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,440
When?

1128
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,280
At the end of this term.

1129
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:17,000
But don't worry...

1130
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,800
I wont miss the joy of 
watching you lose Student.

1131
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,280
I'm a Teresaite after all.

1132
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:30,960
Shreya...

1133
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,440
I love you.

1134
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:39,760
But I don't.

1135
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:03,640
Abhishek.

1136
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,940
Thank god! His eye is not hurt.

1137
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:10,320
That's all ok now...

1138
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,680
But why don't you ask 
these idiots what happened?

1139
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,880
Idiots! Will you'll 
tell us what happened?

1140
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,120
Sir...How should I put it?

1141
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,160
Rohan's challenge 
backfired on all of us.

1142
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,250
The challenge was Rohan's...

1143
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:41,850
but the team is ours right?

1144
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:51,170
My least favorite player 
in this room is Rohan.

1145
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:56,090
But he is the one 
who came to my rescue.

1146
01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:01,370
Those Terisaites... 
they play as a team.

1147
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:02,930
And we?

1148
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:06,930
We have lost even before we started.

1149
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:09,450
You know guys...

1150
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:15,970
Just once in our lives 
let's play as a team.

1151
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:18,130
Then we'll see what happens.

1152
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:21,770
That's the spirit.

1153
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:26,130
Lets all say together, 
'Praise the Lord!'

1154
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:27,210
Praise the Lord!

1155
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:29,170
Silence! This is a hospital.

1156
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,090
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

1157
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:36,410
'Praise the Lord!'

1158
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:37,610
Praise the Lord!

1159
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:50,170
The three important rules of Kabaddi.

1160
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,410
Number one... RESISTANCE!

1161
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:55,170
Become invincible!

1162
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:57,770
So that no one can ever get to you.

1163
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:34,130
Team work!

1164
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:35,650
Play like a team...

1165
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:36,970
If you stay together...

1166
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:38,290
you'll survive longer.

1167
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:40,570
COME ONNNNNN!

1168
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:59,810
Power! Use your strength 
in such a way...

1169
01:47:59,930 --> 01:48:03,410
that you destroy your opponent!

1170
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:25,610
And it's finally the big day!

1171
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:29,370
Welcome to the Dignity Cup 2019!

1172
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:32,210
I am Dimpy, your ex student.

1173
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:35,690
And i'm, 
the one and only Jeet Khuraana!

1174
01:49:35,770 --> 01:49:38,770
Eight colleges from Dehradhun and Mussoorie, 
will compete against each other...

1175
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:42,290
for the years biggest sports competition... 
which will be held for three days!

1176
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:45,050
Athletics on day one and Kabaddi 
on the remaining two days!

1177
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:49,170
The team that scores the highest points 
in both events... will win the Dignity Cup!

1178
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:52,840
And the best player of the best 
team will win STUDENT OF THE YEAR!

1179
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:56,410
The first race of the first day.

1180
01:49:56,490 --> 01:49:57,690
Hundred meter race!

1181
01:49:57,770 --> 01:50:01,130
Manav Singh Randhawa 
holds the record for this.

1182
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:05,090
And he is competing for his Student 
of the year hat-trick this year!

1183
01:50:06,650 --> 01:50:08,410
- Come on, come on! 
- Let's go Rohan!

1184
01:50:12,330 --> 01:50:13,330
The race begins!

1185
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:15,090
The competition underway...

1186
01:50:15,170 --> 01:50:15,970
And oh my god!

1187
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:18,010
Rohan's just taken off.

1188
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:19,450
He is in the lead.

1189
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:21,970
Wait! hold on!

1190
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:32,570
WHAT A FINISH!

1191
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:36,250
Manav wins the hundred meters 
for the third time in a row!

1192
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:38,970
Too good!

1193
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:40,690
Manav has broken his own record!

1194
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:43,650
But no worry.

1195
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:45,210
The day
