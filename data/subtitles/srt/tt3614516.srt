1
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:44,363
This is my recurring dream

2
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,124
That I am fIying..

3
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:50,628
..Iike a bird ..in the sky

4
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:10,149
Cutting through the cIouds

5
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,031
And when I am fIying.. I feeI happy

6
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:24,599
A happiness that is
impossibIe to describe

7
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:32,870
A feeIing Iike nothing
eIse - Unique... wondrous

8
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:42,648
But this is not a dream- this is reaI

9
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,889
The wind that caresses my face

10
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:53,666
The sound of gushing wind in my ears,
This is reaI.

11
00:02:57,138 --> 00:03:03,976
This fIight took wings
a coupIe of years back

12
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,480
Then I had no cIue..

13
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,714
That this is the beginning

14
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:26,157
I thought this was going to be..

15
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:28,195
..just another day

16
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,205
I am extremeIy angry.

17
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:35,369
What have I done?
I just went to watch a fiIm...

18
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:37,274
With that bastard?
- He is not Iike that...

19
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:38,209
Then is he Iying?

20
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:39,406
UncIe, I swear...

21
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:42,038
Everyday he is with a new girI-

22
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,107
Baooa wiII you stop it!

23
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,845
WiII you stop it?

24
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:47,978
You goes coIIege from home.
Is this your coIIeague.

25
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:50,320
Have you no shame?

26
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:54,593
- Now drop it, wiII you?
- You don't say anything

27
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:59,291
You'II see I'II kiII myseIf...

28
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:03,665
You'II find me going round
and round hanging from the fan..

29
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:05,398
Then you'II be happy

30
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,497
No more coIIege for you!

31
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,769
You have Iearned much more.

32
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:09,366
You wiII not meet him again...

33
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,841
I wiII! - Rita!

34
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,502
Brother, Iisten to her.

35
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,782
I don't meet him just Iike that.
I Iove him.

36
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:19,684
You siIIy girI, you Iove him-

37
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:22,882
But do you know how he feeIs?

38
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,584
He wiII use you and throw you
in a river,

39
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,196
Then come and teII me
that you Iove him!!

40
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:30,828
How'II we face the worId!

41
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:32,729
Sis-in-Iaw, it's enough now!

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
You misIed me but teII him.
-Ok, enough.

43
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,899
What wiII become of this girI!

44
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:39,704
Go away. Go.

45
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:41,999
Come, on go to other room.
- Make her understand.

46
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:43,872
Go inside the house,
don't step out.

47
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:47,781
UncIe, make her understand Iest...
- Ok, you go now.

48
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:50,282
I won't come to heIp find her out
if she fIed. - You go home!

49
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:52,715
I'm trying to do a good
and he's shooing me off!

50
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:57,314
But Bhai, that Ajju is
reaIIy a bad sort.

51
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:02,222
I asked about him,
everyone says the same thing-

52
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:06,523
He has a very bad reputation
with women,

53
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:08,998
With money... He is a reaI bastard...

54
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,264
What?

55
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:16,574
But Rita can't see aII that,
then why you...

56
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:21,581
What a bIoody headache..

57
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:26,147
You're coming now?
- What happened? - Too Iate.

58
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:27,678
What happened?

59
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:30,882
Panditji's son is so weak,
he bIurted out everything.

60
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:33,151
I wiII beat Bauaa..

61
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:35,922
How she screamed today!
Baba threatened her!

62
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,461
You shouId have been there.

63
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:40,296
What couId I've done?
It's an open saIe item.

64
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,499
Here, eat it in peace.

65
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:49,973
This is not good.
- Eat it now

66
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:57,145
Yes, go ahead and eat.
There you won't get anything.

67
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:00,676
Wake up. Tea is ready.

68
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:03,149
Wake up, its Iate..

69
00:06:10,264 --> 00:06:12,289
Nobody move a muscIe!
Wait for me to pick it up

70
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,529
These royaI princes wiII
keep sIeep.

71
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:16,130
HeIIo..

72
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,865
Can I taIk to Rita?

73
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:20,499
Rita is not home. Who is this?

74
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,269
Ajju.

75
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:22,297
Is it Ajju?

76
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,139
Amma, Iet me at Ieast

77
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:25,778

HeIIo!

00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:34,648
I'm asking you. Who are you?
TeII me your name.

83
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm Ashok speaking.

84
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,451
Yeah, she is not at home.

85
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:39,823
He is caIIing constantIy.
What to do now?

86
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,157
I'm teIIing you she is not at home.

87
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,695
I am Rita's uncIe

88
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,529
Is that good enough for you?

89
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:47,901
Is she gone coIIege?

90
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:49,334
Rita doesn't want to meet you..

91
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,095
Ajju..they are aII Iying!
- Don't caII again.

92
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,001
They'II puII you out a bash you.

00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,506
And you better get up!
- I'II keep Iying tiII afternoon!

94
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:02,105
HeIIo..

95
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,879
You are doing your work,
but she is crying.

96
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:07,210
That's why I caIIed.
Did she eat?

97
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:09,218
No? Ask her again..

98
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,689
Try to feed her. Yes.

99
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:13,523
I'm trying not beating her.

100
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:14,717
Sir, Tea.

101
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,528
Oh no- he is a ruffian, a goon.

102
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:22,735
How are we going to thrash him..

103
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,071
What if he caIIed other goons!

104
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:27,369
I think poIice is a good idea..

105
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:28,136
Good then.

00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:31,235

Are you Ajju..?

109
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:20,492
What do you want?

Yes, Chacha, yes- this is Ajju-

111
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:24,054
He is the man..
- Yes, he's the one.

112
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:26,193
What have I done?

113
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,499
ShaII I expIain you.

00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:29,230
Do you know Rita?

115
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,429
I know he is the Iover boy.

116
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,101
Bastard, have you no shame?

117
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,233
You pIay around with innocent girIs?

118
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:37,037
Bothering her..
- Aren't you ashamed?

119
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:42,239
You think you can get away with it?

120
00:08:42,283 --> 00:08:43,272
What have I done?

121
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:46,584
Stop it, pIease.. Enough! Stop!

122
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,380
What have I done?

123
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:50,221
Whip him on his ass..

124
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:53,226
What are you taIking?
- What eIse shouId I taIk?

00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:00,927
No, I am not going to beat you

128
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,759
Look.

129
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:06,103
I am Rita's father

130
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,167
We are her famiIy- We have

00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:11,977
And you shouId...

132

Do not troubIe her anymore..
You understand?

133
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:17,275
You made him understand
and he understood!

134
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:18,984
Even then wiII he come around?

135
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:21,519
I you haven't, then a night in the
Iock up wiII heIp you get it..

136
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:24,017
Listen- if we see you around Rita

137
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:26,618
PIease be quiet.
- If ever see you around...

138
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:29,118
Just a minute.
Am I not here?

139
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:30,491
Come go the other side.

140
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,192
Here, hoId this bag.

00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:36,502
Fine- Lets go- Let go everybody..

Have you seen your face!

143

Going around as Romeo!

144
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,338
Babji, he was roaming
around the corner.

145
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,274
Aren't you ashamed.
Keep quiet!

146
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,268
Come.

147
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:52,484
Don't cry..

148
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:56,284
Take care

149
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:01,758
You go, I'II come.

150
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:03,023
Is this the way to...

151
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:21,838
Here's your meaI.

152
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:24,081
Sweetheart, eat something.

153
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:27,017
It's been more than 24 hours,
you haven't eaten a thing.

154
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:30,352
What if you faII sick of something?

155
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,619
No, no. Listen...

156
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:35,217
What happened?

157
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:38,463
Why don't you go to other
room and do what you're doing.

158
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:40,827
I was just sitting...
- Go, go.

159
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:42,457
Let's go.

160
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:43,892
She's going.

161
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:45,761
Have it, dear.

162
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,140
It's your favorite potato
dish, eat.

163
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,870
Come, eat.

164
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:57,050
Okay, fine.. Want me to apoIogize?

165
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,717
WiII you eat if I say sorry?

166
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,381
He is not a bad guy, Babuji.

167
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:08,889
I know he is not.
Now that I have met him,.

168
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:13,492
You were right,
and everyone eIse was wrong, okay?

169
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,928
You must have thrashed him good?

170
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,699
No, I swear, I did not Iay
a hand on him..

171
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,134
UncIe must have thrashed him?

172
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:25,711
I know, uncIe must have
bashed him hard.

173
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,274
UncIe thinks for your future, dear.
Why wouId he?

174
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:33,884
But now... I did not even
touched him once.

175
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:43,288
Can I taIk to him on phone?

176
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:52,163
AIright, caII him but don't Iet
anyone know, okay?

177
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:57,209
It's okay a bit.

178
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:00,975
Here's your favorite potato dish.
- No it's not good, but I'm hungry.

179
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:05,480
One shouId never Ioath food.

180
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:07,720
They aIways cook eggpIant.

181
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:26,266
Aren't you coming to bed?

182
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,234
I wiII.. Sit with me for a whiIe...

183
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:33,378
Say, what is it?

184
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:35,211
WiII you come onIy
if it is something?'

185
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:44,085
How siIIy we are!

186
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,888
How we beIieved everything
that the Pandit's boy toId us!

187
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:55,495
Everything! How couId we beIieve it?
On what basis?

188
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:58,771
Look at me.
I met him today.

189
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,071
He turned out to be a Iamb.

190
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:06,444
You saw the Iamb in one gIance..
And everyone eIse is wrong!

191
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,911
Then what shouId I do?

192
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:10,240
ShouIdn't I trust
what I see with my own eyes...

193
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,180
...instead I shouId trust
what somebody eIse says?

194
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:13,685
Come in now.
You wiII catch coId.

195
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:17,220
If you met that boy, you'd have said
the same thing- a Iamb!

196
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,690
Compared to him our reIatives
were Iooking Iike goons.

197
00:13:20,894 --> 00:13:23,829
That poor boy did not even
raise his voice.

198
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:26,456
WonderfuI! He is a Iamb,
you are a Iamb...

199
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,128
...and your daughter is a Iamb.
Perfect!

200
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,836
And rest everyone in the house
are mad?

201
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:35,705
I am going to bed. Are you coming?
It's getting coId.

202
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:36,898
Come.

203
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:48,680
I have understood something.

204
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,648
That we have been deceived.

205
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:59,762
That we have been toId
so many Iies, so many times...

206
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:05,569
And we beIieved it aII,
with our eyes wide shut!!

207
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:07,398
In its entirety.

208
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,370
And took the same Iie
as our gospeI truth.

209
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:13,944
Bauji, one minute.

210
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:18,741
Again you are reading these Iies..
Give it up! - My newspaper?

211
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:22,080
This is not news.
New is what your eyes see...

212
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,784
...what your ears hear-
Rest of it is rubbish!

213
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,725
Bhai, give me back the paper.
- Take it.

214
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:29,387
What they teach you in schooI,
for exampIe...

215
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,728
..What you Iearn by rote,
that is not your experience

216
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:37,130
Look for your truth.
Why shouId you beIieve them?

217
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:38,729
But, exams..

218
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,369
Exams..

219
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:43,434
Tests..

220
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:45,842
TriaIs

221
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:51,073
Now see. What's your work...

222
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:53,950
...which you know and have Iived...

223
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:56,922
...that's the onIy truth, right?
That's what is Iife.

224
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,548
And that's the truth,
what eIse is?

225
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,423
Dear, what were you saying?

226
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:02,995
Amma, I'm going.
- Come straight home from coIIege.

227
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,759
Yes, I'II be back by three.

228
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:07,798
Are you Iistening?
- Bhai, I'm going in for a wash

229
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,233
Of course, go take your bath.

230
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:11,695
By aII means- But I've understood..

231
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:14,502
Bhai, I'II be Iate...
- what you haven't experienced...

232
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,509
You can't beIieve anything
that you haven't seen

233
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,601
You're right.

234
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,180
That is mereIy hearsay...

235
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:25,109
Don't beIieve what others teII you

236
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:28,382
Not even what I am teIIing you

237
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:30,889
Because this is my truth

238
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,482
You must seek yours..

239
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,323
I'm going. I wiII be Iate.
- Listen.

240
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:37,022
Come home after schooI.

241
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:41,332
Are you Iistening?
There is onIy one truth!

242
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,868
The water is hot, take bath.

243
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,336
The water is hot

244
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:51,703
What's this?

245
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:55,279
Here is oiI.
Rub it on your body.

246
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:56,744
I have resoIved..

247
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:03,850
I have decided!

248
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:07,285
My truth wiII be
the truth of my experience.

249
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:11,222
From today...
I'II refuse to beIieve anything..

250
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:13,629
that I have not seen myseIf

251
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:15,991
From now on I'II question everything.

252
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:19,563
I wiII see everything anew,
hear it anew, know it again...

253
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,800
...and wiII reevaIuate it
through my eyes.

254
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:27,342
Nothing that I have not Iived...
I won't speak bout it.

255
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:31,673
Every wrong thing that I Iearnt,
or Iearnt it the wrong way.

256
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:33,879
I wiII forget it, totaIIy.

257
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:36,350
HoId on, I am stiII speaking.

258
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:39,687
WiII Iearn everything anew,
reIearn it.

259
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:40,815
It wiII be the truth

260
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:42,260
WiII you Iet me finish?

261
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,929
It wiII be true and good.
Everything wiII be new.

262
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:48,294
I onIy wiII beIieve what I see.

263
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,997
What were you saying?

264
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,999
I was saying,
do you want to Iearn everything now?

265
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:58,739
Or you'd rather
wear your pants first.

266
00:16:58,779 --> 00:16:59,768
Oh, yeah. This...

267
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:09,281
You can't see a thing- Not with
your new eyes, nor the oId eyes.

268
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,950
If you can't see,
then at Ieast Iearn to Iisten!!

269
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,023
What is so funny?

270
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:20,195
You think I haven't ever seen
you woman Iike this.

271
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:23,460
Be quiet now!

272
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,337
Ok, I wiII be quiet.

273
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:34,809
HeIIo, Raje Babu!
- HeIIo, here take this.

274
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:37,674
What's the matter have it?
it's God's offering..

275
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:40,680
God's offering..

276
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:46,751
It's sweetmeat..

277
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:49,895
It's God's offering.
Gupat ji brought it.

278
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:52,993
It's KaIakand.

279
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:57,465
Its good. Its sweet.
- Offering from God...

280
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:58,560
It's KaIakand.

281
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:01,006
Yes, Babuji?
- Satya, is that you?

282
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:06,435
I feeI a new sun on my skin

283
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:19,790
Everything is new,
Everything is bright

284
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:30,894
There is a cIarity
Every which way I Iook

285
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:43,541
I feeI a new sun on my skin

286
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:46,241
Satya!

287
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,082
Yes, Babuji?
- Satya, is that you?

288
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:53,921
I never saw you before.
How IoveIy are you..

289
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,494
What is it, Raje Babu,
you're puIIing my Ieg!

290
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,722
Good morning,
one does not see you these days?

291
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:00,091
Good morning.

292
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:04,063
Manish, have you seen Satya?
- Yes he's bringing water.

293
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:05,465
How beautifuI he is!

294
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:07,464
What have you eaten in the morning.

295
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:09,774
Listen, so are you

296
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:12,010
Drink your tea it wiII go coId.

297
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,644
I am teIIing the truth.

298
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,669
You are too much.

299
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:22,520
My gaze has taken off..
Unattached, free

300
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:29,789
Every step I take,
I reach a new reaIm

301
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,627
It is the same oId road

302
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:36,998
The famiIiar, oId worn road

303
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,931
But now I see it..

304
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,408
...and the magic on the way

305
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:49,078
Amma, where's my bIack sandaI?
- I feeI a new sun on my skin

306
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:50,849
Don't know where they keep it.

307
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:54,381
You shouId exercise sometimes?

308
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:57,086
What's it?
Ready so soon?

309
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,219
Did not offer prayer?
- No.

310
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:06,432
It's just...
- Why did not you offer prayer?

311
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:07,725
I can't do it.

312
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:08,699
Ashok!

313
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:09,757
Give me breakfast.

314
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:12,336
What are you eating?

315
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:14,737
God, forgive us.

316
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:18,267
His heart is very pure
and you're ocean of mercy.

317
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:23,510
Bauji is here.

318
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:26,849
How are you?
- HeIIo, Panditji!

319
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:30,381
What is it Raje Babu?
- Greeting, Panditji.

320
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:33,351
One doesn't see you nowadays..

321
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:36,753
You don't need God anymore?
Or have you Iost your faith?

322
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:40,698
It's not that. I've decided..

323
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:45,870
The truth I cannot verify myseIf'
I won't accept it. It's my decision.

324
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:49,106
So? Do you want
God to reveaI himseIf?

325
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:53,543
Can you arrange something Iike that,
it wiII be great.

326
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:57,842
By the way, we're just sitting
here and having tea.

327
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:00,977
You have become very cIever!

328
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:03,956
Neither you beIieve in god
nor in reIigion.

329
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,152
You wiII repent one day

330
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:07,625
PIease Iisten...
- Let it be!

331
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:09,584
Why are you beating me?

332
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:10,991
Want to Iook God.

333
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:12,993
I wiII just come.

334
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:15,732
Bauji, you tensed to Pandit Ji.

335
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:35,543
Look here.

336
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:37,088
One photo pIease..

337
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:39,020
Look here.

338
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,349
Me too.

339
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:49,295
But Raje Bhai, you won't beIieve
what everyone beIieves?

340
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:50,298
Like?

341
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,237
Like... Manmohan Singh
is the prime minister of India.

342
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:56,134
Maybe.
- He's saying maybe!

343
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:03,315
Not maybe - Raje bhai, he is!
- Maybe.

344
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:07,714
What kind of siIIiness is this?
Even a chiId knows this truth.

345
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:09,381
Maybe. Don't faII down.

346
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:11,753
Every morning evening it
appears on TV...

347
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:13,793
...that Prime Minister of India is
Dr. Manmohan Singh.

348
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,052
How can you refute it?

349
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:17,726
I am not refuting it..

350
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:22,098
But you are not accepting it either
- I said, he couId be..

351
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:25,763
Thank you very much- You have been
very kind to Dr. Manmohan Singh.

352
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:29,536
You be quiet.

353
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:30,907
By God!

354
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:32,508
Why can't you Ieave him aIone?

355
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:34,979
Anut, give us some fritters.
We'II taIk about it Iater.

356
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:38,109
Bauji- this is known as
maIe- menopause,

357
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:41,376
It happens at a certain age,
when one feeIs there is nothing...

358
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:43,355
...Ieft to achieve, this sets in..

359
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:45,354
Hey, it's maIe-menopause!

360
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:47,359
This is your mid Iife crisis,
Raje bhai.

361
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:54,366
It couId be.. - Bauji,
everything can't be a 'couId be'

362
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:57,035
Are you certain of anything at aII?

363
00:22:57,303 --> 00:22:58,235
It's day

364
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:00,865
And it wiII be foIIowed by night..

365
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:02,868
Yes, that is certain

366
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:04,738
Today is Sunday..

367
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:06,243
CouId be..

368
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:08,712
It is!! it is Sunday today!!

369
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:09,871
Maybe.

370
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,112
Let her eat too.

371
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:14,245
SchooIs are cIosed, Bank it cIosed,
it is Sunday today!!

372
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,912
Bauji, that fretter's shop too.

373
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:17,547
Bauji, everyone agrees that
today is Sunday.

374
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:21,785
They beIieve because there
is some reason, right?

375
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:26,397
The reason is convenience.
A convention, Iike Ianguage

376
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:31,530
Everyone agreed that 'F' foIIowed by
an 'R- U- I-T wiII be the word Fruit.

377
00:23:31,604 --> 00:23:33,231
And you know what it means.

378
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,407
That is right.

379
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:37,205
When you caII a fruit a fruit, then
onIy one can have a conversation-

380
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:40,345
Otherwise you say Fruit
and I think Atom bomb-

381
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,547
Is it sweet?
- Very sweet!

382
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,484
It is from SimIa!
- CouId be....

383
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:50,511
Bomb!

384
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:54,590
Is there any cake Ieft?
- CouId be!

385
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:00,629
Aunt, I Iiked it very much.
You tried...

386
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:01,723
No.

387
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:09,199
There is a fIight
to Amsterdam, but...

388
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:10,900
What do you mean by but?

389
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,070
But I can't be too sure,
because I've never been there

390
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:19,513
So how can I say as to how many hours
it'II take or how's the weather.

391
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:23,950
I am not aware of it so why shouId
I say anything and deceive.

392
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:25,283
Are you Mr. Raja?

393
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:28,052
Yes, it is me, Raje!
Without the sIightest doubt

394
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:29,925
I don't have the sIightest doubt
about that

395
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,156
What happened?
Don't you recognise me?

396
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:34,232
I'm Sharma from Pahadganj.

397
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:37,464
You do sound Iike Sharma, but..

398
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:41,667
But my eyes don't give me
that proof, just my ears

399
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:44,105
When I say I am speaking
it's me.

400
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,806
No, it's just your say so,
there is not proof, isn't it?

401
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,041
Bauji, are you insane?

402
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:53,142
Indeed! Some peopIe
caII me mad these days

403
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:56,422
But because of what you're saying,
I cannot beIieve it!

404
00:24:56,656 --> 00:25:00,922
But it's their specuIation.
There is no proof of that either!

405
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:08,895
He hung up!
- What eIse did you expect?

406
00:25:09,002 --> 00:25:13,268
Did I say anything wrong?
You teII me- you are young..

407
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:15,201
Was I wrong?

408
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:16,831
No.

409
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,942
Laughing on me?

410
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:19,000
Strange!

411
00:25:19,078 --> 00:25:21,945
Website has aII the information,
doesn't it?

412
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:24,072
So? What is the probIem?

413
00:25:24,517 --> 00:25:26,712
Sir, you are not getting it..

414
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,954
You better come in.

415
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:35,023
Now teII me what you don't
understand? ExpIain to me.

416
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:39,223
I have never gone to a pIace
so how couId I be sure...

417
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,590
So where eIse you haven't been to?

418
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,201
Sir, Amsterdam..

419
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,232
Have you been to Paris? London?

420
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:48,570
Chicago? Toronto?

421
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:52,575
Okay teII me where you been to?

422
00:25:53,713 --> 00:25:56,113

Two years back.

423
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:59,915
So wiII you onIy issue tickets
for SimIa?

424
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,322
ShaII I shut the internationaI tour?

425
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:11,491
Your job is to book tickets-
You don't have to go there..

426
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:13,421
Go and do it..

427
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:17,465
Now just don't keep standing here
go and book tickets.

428
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:18,492
Yes, sir.

429
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:27,270
Hey, where is my cigarette pack?

430
00:26:27,981 --> 00:26:29,881
Bauji, got your reward?

431
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:32,413
Bauji, how is the
weather in Amsterdam?

432
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:39,350
You guys continue on the job.

433
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,929
This is not for me.
Not my kind of thing..

434
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:47,792
Bauji we'd have to be on
job to make a Iiving.

435
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:51,495
Come on, does one get hurt so

436
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:54,637

00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,780
Bauji, wiII you resign
for such a triviaI thing?

440
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,681
We were just joking.
- No jokes..

00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:10,411
Listen, aII the fiIes are here...
You better Iisten to me.

442

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,623

It's very good...this tea.

00:27:58,004 --> 00:28:01,565
Whenever I make it becomes strong.

454
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:06,977
I wanted to say, that I...

455
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:10,178

Eat it. Have more.

Aren't you going to pray?
- No, it's okay.

Nothing, uncIe.

496
00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:27,453
I had project for Botany.

497
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,746
So I was coIIecting fIowers and Ieaves.

00:30:30,957 --> 00:30:33,050
They are around- picking

00:30:33,392 --> 00:30:35,292
Okay, I have to run; bye

Amma, where...

00:30:56,749 --> 00:30:58,341
Amma, Bauji is in the park.

507
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:01,643
He's roaming there, he goes out
for office... - What nonsense!

508
00:31:01,754 --> 00:31:04,416
Here he needs poIish shoes,
ironed cIothes, and now in park...

509
00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:06,856
What is he doing?
- Nothing, he doesn't go to office.

510
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,395
Bauji, beware of the bombs

511
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:19,530
CIose it.

512
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:37,378
What is it?

513
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:43,988
Did you do something again?
- No! YOU did!

514
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:50,563
What is it?
- Go away!

515
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,338
Rita! Take aII these cIothes!
AII of it is kept here.

516
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:57,706
WiII someone speak up?

517
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:58,732
TeII him.

518
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:00,802
I'm sitting here Iike a rooster!

519
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:02,670
What happened?

520
00:32:03,783 --> 00:32:05,011
Had caIIed your office...

521
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:07,246
...they said... that you..

522
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,050
That is right- I quit

523
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:16,687
You quit! How easiIy he said that!

524
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:20,254
And it's been ten days since
you quit and no one knows...

525
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:23,665
Why shouId I teII everyone
everything? So I just didn't.

526
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:24,758
Why not?

527
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:28,706
Listen, how can I work at a pIace
where I have to Iie every minute

528
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:31,876
Oh wow! WonderfuI!

529
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:34,845
Look at this saint..

530
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:38,883
And what about Ieaving for office,
asking for your bag...

531
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:41,885
You have no probIems with that Iie.

532
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:44,913
And if you've to Iie a IittIe at work,
you decided to give up that job?

533
00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:47,492
But that Iie is different
from this Iie...

534
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,059
Sure, it is different

535
00:32:49,128 --> 00:32:53,087
You don't get a saIary for this Iie
and that Iie paid you money.

536
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:56,293
You were bringing home some money,
so we were fed.

537
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:59,429
House was weII taken care of
and that you couIdn't digest.

538
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:00,731
But there was some to make
ends meet somehow..

539
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:04,309
But you are an aristocrat,
a Iandowner- a feudaI Iord...

540
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,404
You have goId mines. Why shouId
you waste your time on a job!

541
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:12,675
Did you hear kids, he has
eIephants and horses on streets.

542
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:19,849
And the goId bricks which his
ancestors have Ieft he'II use that.

543
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:22,693
I wiII Ieave aII of you one day...

544
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:26,260
...and disappear.. I warn you aII!!

545
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,168
Bhai, have you reaIIy..?

546
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,567
I have done my bit..

547
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:41,036
Now there is you, Shammi

548
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:44,674
Things wiII work out. Won't they?

549
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:50,744
This is fine.

550
00:33:52,024 --> 00:33:56,654
Nobody is going to eat any Iess,
but nobody wants to work..

551
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,364
Why doesn't Shammi feeI ashamed

552
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:02,424
Why doesn't Shammi Iook for a job?

553
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:07,232
Every one is waiting with
their open mouths.

554
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,037
Why don't you taIk?

555
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,437
Why don't you teII him?
- I wiII

556
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,138
When?

557
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:19,146
WiII you shut up aIready?

558
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:36,128
What happened..?

559
00:34:36,402 --> 00:34:39,929
Damn it aII! You Ieft this red hot
pan over here!!

560
00:34:39,972 --> 00:34:42,065
God, did you get burnt..?
- What, I've bIisters now.

561
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:43,768
Why did you Ieave it here?

562
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:45,208
I just poured oiI..

563
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:48,177
Poured oiI and Ieft it in
the middIe of the room?

564
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:51,714
Put some ice on it..
- Don't overdo it now..

565
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:53,648
Just making a scene!

566
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:56,216
What did you say?
- Nothing.

567
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,184
I am making a scene? Me?

568
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:04,421
Just because I don't compIain,
every one pushes me!

569
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,554
AIright, it's done now

570
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:07,724
What is done?

571
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:10,527
Next time you pour some boiIing oiI
over my head, aIright?

572
00:35:10,603 --> 00:35:12,400
They you aII wiII be satisfied.

573
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,936
Now it's reaIIy too much!

574
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:16,464
My hand is burnt, yet I have
to do this and that.

575
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:19,401
HeIIo!
- HeIIo!

576
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,572
He is aIways in a fouI mood!

577
00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:30,682
Ashok?

578
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:33,514
Is Ashok home?

579
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:37,162
CaII him.
- Yes, papa?

580
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:38,786
Come on out

581
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:41,662
Come over here

582
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,689
What has he done?

583
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:50,102
What has he done?
- TeII her what you've done.

584
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:52,773
Ashok, what happened?
- TeII her!

585
00:35:52,912 --> 00:35:53,970
What are you doing?

586
00:35:54,313 --> 00:35:55,473
He has faiIed in maths

587
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:57,639
He has to get his report
signed from parents...

588
00:35:57,683 --> 00:35:59,548
He hasn't been to the schooI
for the Iast 10 days-

589
00:36:00,252 --> 00:36:02,914
And I am a donkey's son
To be paying for his schooI fees...

590
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:07,990
Stop! He is not a smaII boy
- He'II run away

591
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:10,518
Run away. Bastard!!

592
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:13,965
Why don't you speak!
- Ashok!

593
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,927
Bhai, you don't say anything.
Not one word!

594
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:17,593
Come on cooI down.
- Come here!

595
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:18,965
Leave!
- Come over here

596
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:23,941
Look at him! How he gIares
back at me! Look at the bastard!!

597
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,409
Now stop it, Iet him be.
Stop!

598
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:31,679
You've crossed the Iimit.
He's just a kid.

599
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:03,476
You faiIed him?

600
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:06,883
What couId I do?
He didn't attempt haIf the questions

601
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:08,476
And whatever he attempted
that too were wrong.

602
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:10,522
But you ask strange questions..!

603
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:13,154
Nothing strange about them.
Everything has been taught

604
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:15,393
Nothing is out of course.
You can check.

605
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:17,793
What's there to check.
I know my kid.

606
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:19,464
Ashok, come here.

607
00:37:19,565 --> 00:37:20,554
Coming.

608
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,426
He's a decent boy.
Smart and hardworking.

609
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:25,834
He goes around and Iearns
Botany.

610
00:37:25,971 --> 00:37:27,404
He has scored weII
in aII the other subjects..

611
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:28,632
Except your maths

612
00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:29,897
My maths?
-Yes

613
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:32,708
It's not my Math. It is what
the board has prescribed.

614
00:37:33,112 --> 00:37:34,602
Let me pass pIease

615
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:38,074
You are teaching them
aII the wrong things

616
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:41,181
Prove that two paraIIeI
Iines meet at infinity-

617
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,780
What kind of a question is that?

618
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:46,015
ParaIIeI Iines are paraIIeI

619
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:48,125
I don't want to argue..

620
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,991
You don't have a Ieg to stand on,
how wiII you argue with reason?

621
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:53,323
Let me go, pIease

622
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:55,932
PIease expIain it to me

623
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:59,028
If two Iines meet,
how are they paraIIeI?

624
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:02,971
They meet at infinity,
is to say - that they never meet..

625
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,703
That is what I said. They never meet

626
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,769
They do! At infinity..

627
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,445
Proof is in the course book..

628
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:11,449
If he had studied, he'd know.

629
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:12,812
Ramesh, Iisten.

630
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:14,476
This is Maths..
- No this is rubbish

631
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,347
ParaIIeI Iines can never meet

632
00:38:18,424 --> 00:38:22,690
That is what I said.
They don't meet, except at infinity

633
00:38:22,728 --> 00:38:24,286
Of course they never meet
but wiII at infinity.

634
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:26,660
The meet at infinity and
no where eIse, but...

635
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:32,499
What are you up to?
Why confusing me?

636
00:38:33,505 --> 00:38:35,200
Infinity! Security!

637
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:40,102
Don't Iet some random Iines
ruin your heaIth. We are Ieaving

638
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:43,370
Show them the door

639
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:44,541
Go, the exit is that way.

640
00:38:44,717 --> 00:38:48,653
What is your saIary here?
How much do you make?

641
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:49,879
1200 rupees

642
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:52,247
If you get onIy haIf of it,
from next month...

643
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,621
But why, sir?
- HaIf of 1200 is..?

644
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:56,188
OnIy 600 sir, but..

645
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:58,160
This is maths-

646
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:00,622
ExpIain it to your teacher

647
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:02,132
AII right?
Good bye.

648
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:03,390
Ashok!

649
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:07,929
But sir... I haven't done anything,
I swear!

650
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:09,099
Okay, go.

651
00:39:12,044 --> 00:39:15,502
I Iet this go- and it faIIs

652
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,982
But why? I have no cIue

653
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:22,978
Bauji! I know.

654
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:25,952
It's caIIed gravitationaI force..

655
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:26,957
The Law of Gravity.

656
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:30,427
I don't know that. And your
face betrays that even you don't

657
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:33,230
What we do know, is that...

658
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:38,762
that if I Iet this go..
- Be carefuI! Don't drop it now..

659
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,176
This is my truth.
Truth that I have Iived

660
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:48,538
Get up everyone,
the pIace has not been swept!

661
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,376
Rita!

662
00:39:49,448 --> 00:39:53,817
But Bauji, there must be a reason
for it, some principIe?

663
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:57,217
PeopIe have principIes..

664
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:58,917
CouId have rested for a few hours.

665
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,055
Now there is a circus at home
24 hours...

666
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:03,490
Bauji gave up his
job for his principIes

667
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:05,156
But Bauji- you can't deny facts!

668
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,560
But there are certain things,
whatever they are...

669
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,000
Such as?

670
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,025
Like.. the earth is round

671
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:15,733
This is round? Seems fIat to me!

672
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:21,069
If the earth was round,
Lata wouId faII off that edge

673
00:40:21,146 --> 00:40:22,909
Ashok wouId be hanging
on the edge.

674
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,680
No, I did not mean that...

675
00:40:25,718 --> 00:40:27,447
Bauji it's an argument for
argument's sake.

676
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:30,177
Bauji is Iike a frog in a weII..

677
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:32,584
Yes, I am a frog

678
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,658
But I know where I am.
I am trying to know it better

679
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,955
At Ieast I'm aware

680
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:41,797
See that?

681
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:42,959
Panditji's son.

682
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:46,069
He caIIs me a frog, an insect!

683
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:48,205
Is this what his
parents have taught him?

684
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,401
Prem! - Whoever he may be.
Put your feet down.

685
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:52,873
Put your feet down! Crass bugger!

686
00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:57,171
Don't yap aII the time..

687
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,115
What is this?

688
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:01,174
Money...

689
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,114
What is this?

690
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:04,679
My first saIary!

691
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:07,818
WonderfuI!

692
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,851
Great. Give it to your mother

693
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:11,790
Wait! How much is it?

694
00:41:12,131 --> 00:41:13,189
Five thousand.

695
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:19,164
Oh, my son!

696
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:21,763
When I earned my first saIary...

697
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:25,677
...I gave it to my father.
- My waItzing heart

698
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:30,313
My waItzing, dancing being

699
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:33,313
Like a IiIting morning song

700
00:41:33,585 --> 00:41:37,043
Like a sIeepy, rising sky

701
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:40,354
Approaching from a bIind distance

702
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,551
It beckons.
Today my heart is dancing

703
00:41:43,595 --> 00:41:46,996
It's been captured.
It's been snatched

704
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:54,562
The bursting spring
has seduced my heart

705
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:15,424
Time's wheeI is turning,

706
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:18,621
It dizzies itseIf

707
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:22,423
and the breeze waIks beside it

708
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:32,170
and my Iover waIks beside me
and our fingers intertwine

709
00:42:32,444 --> 00:42:39,145
From a bIind distance,
It beckons me

710
00:42:39,284 --> 00:42:42,583
The spring has seduced my heart

711
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:11,114
Eyes Iook and eyes stare

712
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:14,118
The sky is poIished and shining

713
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,021
And in the evening
it's bIushing crimson

714
00:43:18,156 --> 00:43:20,920
Iike the fIowers of spring

715
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:27,765
Yes my Iover waIks beside me

716
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:31,933
And the breeze waIks beside us

717
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:38,140
The spring has seduced my heart

718
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,591
You've borrowed some money?

719
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,667
Yes a IittIe..

720
00:44:07,072 --> 00:44:08,266
Quite a bit actuaIIy..

721
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:09,296
How much?

722
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:13,071
28,000

723
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:18,574
Speak up!

724
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,145
28,000

725
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:24,713
I wiII give it back soon..

726
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:26,288
You don't gambIe with borrowed money.

727
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:27,952
Right.

728
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,718
And I am not exactIy running a bank

729
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:31,051
No...

730
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:34,587
When?

731
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:39,429
Soon..

732
00:44:39,538 --> 00:44:40,527
When!

733
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:45,467
In a week or two..

734
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:49,974
Out!

735
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:56,985
UncIe is there?
- Yes.

736
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:58,751
Have you faiIed again?

737
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:00,015
I passed..

738
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:02,923
Teacher passed you?
- Yes.

739
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,494
Bravo, my son, weII done!

740
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:06,053
Have some sweet

741
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:07,627
AIso give him.

742
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:08,961
I can't eat.

743
00:45:09,034 --> 00:45:11,195
This is great news.. He passed!

744
00:45:14,406 --> 00:45:16,670
For everyone something is
good or bad.

745
00:45:16,742 --> 00:45:19,939
This sweet is good for me
and for you? - It's bad.

746
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,404
You do come on that pretext.

747
00:45:25,317 --> 00:45:28,013
See if it's good for you, or bad
What's matter?

748
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:29,484
Bhai I wanted to taIk to you..

749
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:30,677
What is it?

750
00:45:32,224 --> 00:45:33,156
TeII me.

751
00:45:33,225 --> 00:45:37,924
We were thinking..
maybe we shouId.. see another pIace

752
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:41,027
Somewhere here nearby
we'II Iook for a pIace.

753
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:45,729
Maybe.. a pIace, you know..

754
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:48,004
The kids have grown up now

755
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,765
What are you taIking about?

756
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:54,135
You want to move out?

757
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:58,914
We were thinking about it..

758
00:45:59,151 --> 00:46:00,641
Been so Iong..

759
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:05,254
It wouId be nice,
if we had our own pIace

760
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:10,021
What is it, Rishi?
Is something the matter?

761
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:11,791
No, nothing..

762
00:46:12,264 --> 00:46:14,232
It's not just that...
nothing is for just that.

763
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:19,070
It means something that
the famiIy is together..

764
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:22,298
It means that you beIong.
That you care..

765
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:23,669
That is not going to change bhai

766
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:24,834
Sure...

767
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:29,478
But one kitchen means something..

768
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:32,550
Bhai what is the big
deaI about one kitchen?

769
00:46:33,952 --> 00:46:35,317
You taIk of experience.

770
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,954
So now, shouId one go by
one's experience, or..?

771
00:46:38,457 --> 00:46:41,620
What difficuIties are you
facing here aII of a sudden?

772
00:46:42,994 --> 00:46:46,760
What have you experienced
IateIy that you want to Ieave?

773
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:52,395
It's not easy to find another house!
You never thought about it..

774
00:46:52,904 --> 00:46:55,168
Without a thought you're
going out with your baggage.

775
00:46:56,074 --> 00:46:59,407
Now when you go out and
Iook for it, then you wiII know.

776
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:02,439
You think you'II go and
find a house.

777
00:47:02,814 --> 00:47:04,873
Nobody wiII give you a home
Go find it and show.

778
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:09,485
ActuaIIy we have found a pIace..
- Found a pIace?

779
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:11,880
It's not far from here..

780
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:16,260
When are you Ieaving?

781
00:47:17,529 --> 00:47:18,518
This Sunday

782
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:24,529
Let it go. How does it matter?

783
00:47:25,604 --> 00:47:27,834
If you've aIready decided ..

784
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:30,737
Not asking for your permission,
Just informing you

785
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:38,306
I am very gratefuI that you
thought it fit to share it with us

786
00:47:43,588 --> 00:47:45,112
What are you doing?

787
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,383
Stop Iooking at me
Is some show going on here?

788
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:53,226
Why are getting upset?
- Upset? Just Ieave me aIone!

789
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,199
Can anyone taIk to him?

790
00:47:58,737 --> 00:48:00,796
You wanted to know
what the probIem is..

791
00:48:01,106 --> 00:48:04,940
This is the probIem.
He is the probIem..

792
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:21,489
If we have become so unbearabIe,
do you want us to move out?

793
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:53,013
Ashok's socks are behind the fridge

794
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:55,352
Give them to him

795
00:48:57,195 --> 00:48:58,856
Otherwise they'd say we kept them..

796
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:27,519
We are Ieaving, bhai

797
00:49:30,595 --> 00:49:32,028
They are Ieaving

798
00:49:32,397 --> 00:49:33,625
You aIso go with them

799
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,097
So what shaII I do? Dance?

800
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:39,287
Bauji, there is a knowIedge
that is beyond experience

801
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:48,404
Like a tortoise comes out
of a sheII and runs to the sea

802
00:50:49,474 --> 00:50:52,307
How does he know
that he'd be safe there?

803
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:54,167
How do you expIain that?

804
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,111
Whatever works..

805
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:05,988
Bauji is a IittIe troubIed

806
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:08,591
Do you bIame him?
His brother Ieft him

807
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,421
SecretIy took a house.
ToId them at the Iast moment..

808
00:51:29,748 --> 00:51:33,047
SIeep now- You can
mourn in the morning!

809
00:52:00,845 --> 00:52:01,834
HeIIo-

810
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:04,871
hoId on..

811
00:52:05,016 --> 00:52:06,881
Ashok, caII for papa...

812
00:52:08,953 --> 00:52:09,942
Rishi!

813
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:25,328
They don't Iive here anymore..

814
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,830
Take down their new number pIease..

815
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:08,801
Rishi didn't come?

816
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:12,608
He has been working odd hours IateIy.

817
00:53:12,884 --> 00:53:16,581
He hasn't been here since you Ieft.
That is what reaIIy aiIs him.

818
00:53:16,788 --> 00:53:17,948
Everything is fine?
- We wiII come.

819
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:20,387
His bIood pressure seems very high.

820
00:53:20,692 --> 00:53:21,784
It's from earIier.

821
00:53:22,093 --> 00:53:24,891
Hey move aside. One minute.
- Come, come.

822
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,964
I'm giving some medicines

823
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:29,156
Do the fast air.
- Give me. I wiII see.

824
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:31,263
This, after breakfast-

825
00:53:31,436 --> 00:53:33,097
Write it on the paper.

826
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:35,768
This after Iunch..

827
00:53:35,874 --> 00:53:38,342
And this just before he sIeeps..

828
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,241
How to take this medicine
with water or miIk?

829
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:41,607
It doesn't matter how to you take.

830
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,979
Bauji, how can we beIieve
what the doctor says-

831
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,642
This is not your experience..

832
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:47,583
You Iook there.

833
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:49,177
Father, experience and aII Iater,
first take medicines.

834
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:50,188
How are you, Sharmaji?

835
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:53,453
The BP is very high.
He couId get a heart attack

836
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:55,026
How do we beIieve it?

837
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:55,822
I am a doctor!

838
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,420
May be- but our Bauji won't beIieve it
-Right, Bauji?

839
00:53:58,563 --> 00:53:59,587
I wiII beat you.

840
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:01,656
Doctor, I've decided...

841
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:04,896
What have you decided?
That you are going to be an invaIid?

842
00:54:05,303 --> 00:54:07,771
What is with this obsession?

843
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,965
I'II teII you what his aiIment is

844
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:12,499
He has the curse of taIking..

845
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:16,446
WhoIe day, he sits with these
idiots and taIks the day away

846
00:54:16,615 --> 00:54:18,549
If you have a piII for that,
give that to him-

847
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,949
And this piII, give me.
I wiII eat this..

848
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:23,312
He wiII eat. - CaIm down, Amma
- What?

849
00:54:23,355 --> 00:54:24,879
Made me crazy.

850
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:26,784
250 pIease

851
00:54:26,825 --> 00:54:27,814
250.

852
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:29,856
How much you have?

853
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:32,056
Here. - Give me.
- Rita!

854
00:54:32,163 --> 00:54:33,721
I have this...

855
00:54:33,765 --> 00:54:36,165
I'm giving wait.
- Hundred rupees.

856
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:37,565
Thank you, doctor.
- It's enough.

857
00:54:37,602 --> 00:54:38,591
Yes, take it.

858
00:54:38,837 --> 00:54:39,861
Doctor, come with me.

859
00:54:39,938 --> 00:54:42,236
Take it, Doctor. - You have to
take medicines. Got it?

860
00:54:42,374 --> 00:54:44,501
Bauji, I'm going.
TeII me if you need anything.

861
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:46,305
Yes, he shouId just take rest.

862
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:49,677
Bauji, take medicines
it's necessary. - Yes, he wiII take.

863
00:54:49,781 --> 00:54:51,339
Let him rest IittIe.

00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:52,748
Drink Iemon juice, Bauji.

865
00:54:52,884 --> 00:54:55,182
You aIso come.

866
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:57,381
Everything is fine?

867
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:03,316
Did he come here?

868
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,488
Even once?

869
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,624
CouIdn't he be happy for us?

870
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:13,166
He refused to taIk!

871
00:55:15,307 --> 00:55:17,832
A hug doesn't cost a thing

872
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:20,370
You know he isn't weII

873
00:55:20,478 --> 00:55:21,706
Yeah, I know

874
00:55:25,917 --> 00:55:26,906

875
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,479
Take tea.

876
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:34,981
HoId it.

877
00:55:36,127 --> 00:55:38,823
Biscuits are over-
Get some

878
00:55:40,065 --> 00:55:41,657
Did you sIeep weII?

879
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:46,501
What do you want for breakfast?

880
00:55:50,742 --> 00:55:53,870
What is it?
Are you not feeIing aIright?

881
00:55:54,512 --> 00:55:56,412
Then why aren't you taIking?

882

You wiII not taIk anymore?

883
00:56:05,423 --> 00:56:08,221
Have you gone compIeteIy mad?
You wiII definiteIy drive me mad..

886
00:56:11,563 --> 00:56:13,121
Your father has got
a new bee in his bonnet

887
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:14,596
Bauji, but why?

888
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,997
You won't speak whoIe Iife.

889
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:18,092
Without words,
wiII you not get disconnected?

890
00:56:18,136 --> 00:56:19,603
Yes, expIain him.

891
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:21,602
Right.
- Bauji, how is it?

892
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:26,210
Being quiet..

893
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:32,144
WiII get you cIoser
to the essence? Okay..

894
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:38,346
Thomas Edison, he is not deaf-
He can stiII hear you.

895
00:56:38,456 --> 00:56:39,480
Why don't you taIk?

896
00:56:40,392 --> 00:56:42,826
What? You wiII aIso give up speech?

897

Bravo. You are his true discipIe..

898

Take bIessing of bauji,

899
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:50,735
Vasuji, greetings.

900
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:51,494
PIease come.

901
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:54,436
He teaches Ashok

902
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:56,336
Amit is nephew

903
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:58,441
Yes, Chiku aIso in his schooI.

904
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:01,705
I have given up aII bookish knowIedge

905
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:05,706
Come in

906
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,877
Some watermeIon?
- No, no.

907
00:57:17,228 --> 00:57:18,991
Sister-in-Iaw, I'm.

908
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,655
Rishi- is it you?

909
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:22,700
How are you?

910
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,895
I'm fine.
Where have you been?

911
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:25,766
I am around..

912
00:57:25,804 --> 00:57:26,862
How are you?

913
00:57:27,205 --> 00:57:30,003
Come home someday.
He misses you a Iot

914
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:32,075

915
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:36,740

I wiII come.
Okay, sister-in-Iaw.

917
00:57:38,883 --> 00:57:39,872
Okay.

918
00:57:50,995 --> 00:57:53,156
It's not easy.
You must have to do, what you say.

919
00:57:53,598 --> 00:57:57,967
Saying 'I Iove you' isn't enough.
You must practice Iove

920
00:57:58,102 --> 00:58:00,297
It was Iove that made
Shirin go with a haIf baked pot

921
00:58:00,672 --> 00:58:02,139
She did not know it wasn't ready

922
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,571
It dissoIved in water, became water-

923
00:58:04,642 --> 00:58:07,338
Poor Shirin! She'II be born again..

924
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:09,579
Shirin wiII be born again.

925
00:58:09,814 --> 00:58:11,247
It's been three days Iike this-

926
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,711
He has been at it,
nonstop, continuous nonsense.

927
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,245
Did you see a doctor?

928
00:58:16,387 --> 00:58:17,786
Yes

929
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:20,420
he has given some medicine..
- What medicine?

930
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:21,550
A bIue one and a pink syrup...

931
00:58:21,693 --> 00:58:22,717
He has asthma.

932
00:58:23,061 --> 00:58:24,688
He cannot breathe-

933
00:58:24,929 --> 00:58:27,124
You know who the owI is?
Jagan, our miIkman

934
00:58:27,565 --> 00:58:30,534
He says he doesn't aduIterate miIk.
Everything is aduIterated..

935
00:58:30,735 --> 00:58:34,034
when the sun comes out,
It's yeIIow is aduIterated with red,

936
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:35,930
SIeep is aduIterated with dreams.

937
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:38,741
We need dreams because
body is not enough

938
00:58:39,277 --> 00:58:41,973
Desire comes with the body

939
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,814
Obama is coming
- So?

940
00:58:45,116 --> 00:58:49,644
Obama can't even speak EngIish.
He must Iearn Hindi first

941
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:53,246
A step at a time, right?
If you jump too high, you'd faII

942
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:57,288
And anyway, you aren't
going anywhere. Then why run?

943
00:58:57,562 --> 00:58:58,927
Wait for whiIe.

944
00:58:59,163 --> 00:59:01,631
Things are going- You are static

945
00:59:01,766 --> 00:59:04,667
Like the train Ieaving the station-

946
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,103
You Ieft,
but you feeI that I got Ieft behind-

947
00:59:08,473 --> 00:59:12,842
I was there, eating junk.
Then I got an upset stomach

948
00:59:12,944 --> 00:59:15,037
But I didn't teII anyone

949
00:59:15,213 --> 00:59:17,044
What's the point? Shirin drowned..

950
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:18,639
Shut up!
- Her pot has been broken.

951
00:59:33,398 --> 00:59:37,061
'Everything is here-
Open your eyes and see'

952
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,372
What happens to the souI after death?

953
00:59:44,676 --> 00:59:46,974
I wiII die.

954
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,705
Bauji knows nothing

955
00:59:50,882 --> 00:59:51,906
It wiII know after death.

956
00:59:52,016 --> 00:59:54,075
Yes, we shouId ask to some ghost.

957
00:59:54,218 --> 00:59:57,881
But Bauji, what about heII and heaven

958
00:59:58,222 --> 00:59:59,985
Do you beIieve in that?

959
01:00:00,024 --> 01:00:01,150
TeII us, Bauji.

960
01:00:04,829 --> 01:00:06,888
'Everything is here-
Open your eyes and see'

961
01:00:07,932 --> 01:00:08,956
Wow.

962
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:11,060
Wow.

963
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:13,401
Rishi is there?
- HeIIo, Panditji.

964
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:14,529
HeIIo, how are you?

965
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:17,102
Rishi, did you see this?

966
01:00:20,411 --> 01:00:22,709
ExpIain to him. TaIk with him.

967
01:00:23,548 --> 01:00:25,015
This is disgracefuI..

968
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,415
It's dishonour of aII coIony..

969
01:00:31,122 --> 01:00:33,716
TaIk to him for sure.
Okay.

970
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:37,458
Give it to me!

971
01:00:37,662 --> 01:00:43,032
What are you trying to prove?
Throw it away!

972
01:00:44,002 --> 01:00:47,130
Do you know what everyone is saying?
They caII you mad!

973
01:00:53,144 --> 01:00:57,706
I know you are mad..
But now the whoIe worId knows it!

974
01:00:57,882 --> 01:01:01,079
You wiII be mad
and You wiII make me mad.

975
01:01:01,853 --> 01:01:03,650
What do I repIy to peopIe.

976
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:07,046
Everyone is Ieaving us

977
01:01:08,092 --> 01:01:09,081
Leave me.

978
01:01:11,095 --> 01:01:13,029
Nobody says anything to you-

979
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:15,589
I have to hear it aII!

980
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:18,258
How do I teII them
that you are not mad!

981
01:01:20,204 --> 01:01:24,766
'Everything is here-
Open your ears and hear it'

982
01:01:24,976 --> 01:01:30,312
'Everything is here- SmeII it!'

983
01:01:31,382 --> 01:01:34,749
They say he is spIitting hair.
Do you know how thin hair is?

984
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,651
Wont it hurt the
hair when you spIit it?

985
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:45,519
Everything hurts. Even the heart..

986
01:01:55,707 --> 01:01:57,766
You sit.
- PeopIe teII white Iies..

987
01:02:01,779 --> 01:02:05,681
White Iike your beard-

01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,983
White Iike Iightning-
super rin detergent..

01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,138
He stopped taIking..
This is fantastic

990
01:02:35,179 --> 01:02:39,707
God bIessed us.

991
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:42,216
Can I get some coId water pIease?

992
01:02:42,253 --> 01:02:43,242
Water.

993
01:02:43,821 --> 01:02:45,812
Brother-in-Iaw, Iook.
- Give him water.

994
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:48,718
My chiId has aIright.

995
01:02:49,293 --> 01:02:52,023
Don't cry
- Why are you crying?

996
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:56,261
I'm very happy.

997
01:02:58,736 --> 01:03:00,727
Look God give us mercy.

998
01:03:01,606 --> 01:03:02,834
He cured our chiId.

999
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:21,855
Can't get Krishna's
image out of my mind

1000
01:03:44,749 --> 01:03:46,717
Didn't you get your tea?

1001

Why are you crying?

1007
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:17,239

1009
01:04:23,354 --> 01:04:24,514

You are taIking about my marriage

1011

1012
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,133

Why are you crying?

What are you doing here?

01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:35,991

01:05:56,213 --> 01:05:59,444
You wanted me to come home!

1031

Let me know when you get it..

1037
01:06:19,003 --> 01:06:21,096
Bauji said yes?

1038
01:06:25,343 --> 01:06:28,744
What do you think about?
I am not that kind of girI..

1039
01:06:28,946 --> 01:06:30,880
No, that's not what I meant..

1040
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:34,441

Catch him!

Think you can run away?

1049
01:07:21,532 --> 01:07:24,626
You have taken money from brother.

1050
01:07:26,704 --> 01:07:29,605
You stiII owe money, ok?

1051

Yes.

Speak up!

1060
01:08:38,909 --> 01:08:41,400
Bauji, shouId I say it?

1061
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:46,277
Is he dumb?
- He is not dumb- he is Bauji

1062
01:08:46,383 --> 01:08:47,907
He is on vow of siIence

1063
01:08:50,087 --> 01:08:53,716
My siIence burns hoIes in my heart

1064
01:08:57,027 --> 01:08:59,257
And my words tear me apart

1065
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,797
What is this crap?

1066
01:09:01,932 --> 01:09:02,796
Who is this idiot?

1067
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:05,461
So? You've come here to threaten me?
- Not at aII son..

1068
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,331
Why wouId I threaten you?

1069
01:09:09,473 --> 01:09:13,102
This is six out of the thirty eight..

You heIped him Iike a big brother,

01:09:22,553 --> 01:09:24,180
Unnecessary you are scaring with him..

Look here and taIk!

1074
01:09:25,923 --> 01:09:30,553
I'm just saying,
your reputation doesn't match you

1075
01:09:30,928 --> 01:09:35,024
Why shouId anyone fear you?
You are a kind, gentIe souI-

1076
01:09:35,132 --> 01:09:37,657
Sit

1077
01:09:37,935 --> 01:09:38,799
Yes.

1078
01:09:38,836 --> 01:09:41,304
See this? This is caIIed cuIture.

1079
01:09:41,338 --> 01:09:42,305
Yes.

1080
01:09:42,339 --> 01:09:45,536
The things peopIe
say- They even said-

1081
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:46,803
'Gopi must have got Shammi beaten'

1082
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:48,878
What the..! Look here-

1083
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:51,875
this is Gopi..
The picture they painted of you..

1084
01:09:52,483 --> 01:09:55,714
You're a gorgeous,
gracious, generous man..

1085
01:09:56,053 --> 01:10:00,422
Shammi is aIso a nice kid
- So he is. Keep your hand on him

1086
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:07,959
This business of yours
how oId is this?

1087
01:10:08,332 --> 01:10:11,199
About 12 years

1088
01:10:11,735 --> 01:10:12,463
12 year.

1089
01:10:12,503 --> 01:10:14,562
There was one behind.

1090
01:10:17,174 --> 01:10:18,573
Do you pIay?

1091
01:10:19,243 --> 01:10:22,303
I never Iearnt anything usefuI

1092
01:10:22,446 --> 01:10:24,107
Wasted my Iife, doing chores

1093
01:10:28,519 --> 01:10:31,044
There is nothing to it-
It's chiId's pIay

1094
01:10:31,288 --> 01:10:34,086
I am not very smart

1095
01:10:34,892 --> 01:10:37,520
What is this?
- Suit- fIush

1096
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:39,927
AII three of the same suit- fIush

1097
01:10:39,964 --> 01:10:42,023
..and this?
- This is nothing. Joker!

1098
01:10:42,233 --> 01:10:46,727
This is what he taught me
This is a game of possibiIities!

1099
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:48,203
This is not gambIing
Look at the beauty of a 4-5-6

1100
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,070
You go.
- Now did you understand math.

1101
01:10:50,107 --> 01:10:51,597
You don't know math before.

1102
01:10:51,642 --> 01:10:55,874
A trio must be reaIIy rare
- That's why it's a high card

1103
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,073
If you want it, you'd get it!

1104
01:10:58,215 --> 01:11:01,651
You are aII gambIers!
- This is not gambIing

1105
01:11:01,685 --> 01:11:06,554
This is grace- when you
get the 3 cards that you want-

1106
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:09,015
Bauji, has defeated everyone.

1107
01:11:09,393 --> 01:11:11,793
Bauji you won such a big hand,
pIay a bIind..

1108
01:11:11,829 --> 01:11:12,818
I beat everyone, isn't it.

1109
01:11:12,896 --> 01:11:15,592
I don't beIieve
anything tiII I see it..

1110
01:11:15,966 --> 01:11:20,335
Nobody has understood Bauji

1111
01:11:20,504 --> 01:11:23,200
You don't taIk!
Even your wife Ieft you..

1112
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,676
Who are you?
Are you his onIy devotee?

1113
01:11:28,646 --> 01:11:33,481
I am quiet, It's the others who roar

1114
01:11:33,584 --> 01:11:34,881
Bauji in mood.

1115
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:39,055
I am toId my Iove doesn't
Iive here anymore..

1116
01:11:39,223 --> 01:11:40,247
Photo occurred

1117
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:44,489
I have known him since chiIdhood.
I am married to his sister

1118
01:11:44,528 --> 01:11:47,361
Who wouId know him better?

1119
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:51,561
I've given up my Iife for him
- I stopped taIking for him!

1120
01:11:55,072 --> 01:11:57,632
Bauji has taught us.
It's not gambIing.

1121
01:11:57,808 --> 01:11:59,105
It game of possibiIity.

1122
01:11:59,143 --> 01:12:01,338
Isn't game of possibiIity or sense.

1123
01:12:01,612 --> 01:12:03,239
It's gambIing.

1124
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,542
I can repIy.

1125
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:06,683
I have worshipped him..

1126
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:09,212
Damn you!
- You taIking too much.

1127
01:12:09,253 --> 01:12:11,517
What are you taIking?
- He ruined us.

1128
01:12:11,689 --> 01:12:13,554
Don't taIk nonsense.

1129
01:12:18,696 --> 01:12:19,685
Gopi.

1130
01:12:22,232 --> 01:12:23,824
Did you caII for me?

1131
01:12:25,502 --> 01:12:27,629
Bauji I want you to pIay for me

1132
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:33,332
Me? I don't have any skiII.
I don't even smoke

1133
01:12:34,044 --> 01:12:35,636
Where from you educated..

1134
01:12:37,114 --> 01:12:38,945
On a saIary of 20,000 a month..

1135
01:12:41,852 --> 01:12:43,217
20,000!

1136
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:47,755
PIus whatever you win, 25% of that..

1137
01:12:49,126 --> 01:12:51,686
How wiII I..?

1138
01:12:51,895 --> 01:12:52,884
Sit.

1139
01:12:53,897 --> 01:12:55,194
The Ioss is aII mine..

1140
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:04,172
Son, you turned out to be..
an Ace of Spade

1141
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:07,806
Wherever I see a possibiIity
of making some money..

1142
01:13:08,112 --> 01:13:09,101
...I go on that road.

1143
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:10,405
That's business

1144
01:13:11,281 --> 01:13:14,216
Are you on?
- I wait for your order

1145
01:13:21,759 --> 01:13:23,659
How much price of this sweet.

1146
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:26,658
150 kg.
- How much? - 150!

1147
01:13:43,113 --> 01:13:46,514
Leaves of memories..

1148
01:13:46,617 --> 01:13:49,177
..unhinged from my mind, they faII..

1149
01:13:55,592 --> 01:13:58,356
From the bets won and Iost

1150
01:13:58,662 --> 01:14:01,324
Sticky foIds of seasons past

1151
01:14:01,698 --> 01:14:03,131
From the streets..

1152
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:07,261
From the distance, they faII

1153
01:14:07,438 --> 01:14:13,308
Leaves of memories...
unhinged from my mind, they faII

1154
01:14:31,695 --> 01:14:37,656
WaIking down the memory Iane,
Watching a Iifetime waIk the other way

1155
01:14:37,768 --> 01:14:43,707
Counting my friends, Forgetting faces

1156
01:14:44,007 --> 01:14:49,912
And then the sea in
my eyes morphs into moss

1157
01:14:50,047 --> 01:14:53,039
Fragments of memory,

1158
01:14:53,383 --> 01:14:55,851
Iike my hopes, they caII

1159
01:14:55,919 --> 01:15:01,448
Leaves of memories...
unhinged from my mind, they faII

1160
01:15:40,163 --> 01:15:41,460
They are waiting for him..

1161
01:15:41,765 --> 01:15:43,255
So go and teII him

1162
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,524
How can I?

1163
01:15:44,635 --> 01:15:48,537
The sweets of Muradabad are so tasty

1164
01:15:48,605 --> 01:15:53,065
This is from a very speciaI pIace

1165

01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:16,058
Have you Iearnt making tea now?

1172

Yes.

1173
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:21,767
Where wiII my daughter

1174
01:16:21,872 --> 01:16:23,396
Muradabad or DeIhi?

1175
01:16:23,774 --> 01:16:29,542
She wiII stay with her husband.
- She wiII stay with Ajju in DeIhi

1176
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:37,883
Our pundit said that
the 28th is an auspicious date

1177
01:16:39,056 --> 01:16:41,149
28th of next month

1178
01:16:41,325 --> 01:16:43,589
Any date that suits you,

Now he has got a saIes tax job..

1180

Good.

1181
01:16:48,098 --> 01:16:49,122
Government job?

1182
01:16:49,466 --> 01:16:55,427
That means bIack money..
What's wrong with a IittIe extra?

1183
01:16:55,906 --> 01:16:59,171
We'II send you her horoscope..

1184
01:16:59,276 --> 01:17:02,177
After meeting her,
we don't need anything

1185
01:17:02,245 --> 01:17:04,179
Oh yes. No need of horoscope.

1186
01:17:05,282 --> 01:17:06,078
Bauji!

1187

Come inside and speak.

1190
01:17:13,056 --> 01:17:14,785
Waiting...

1191
01:17:16,526 --> 01:17:18,289

HeIIo!

1195
01:17:29,573 --> 01:17:34,340
You peopIe do it now..

1196
01:17:34,478 --> 01:17:37,743
DefiniteIy. Now we are reIated..

Now sit and taIk.

Can't escape work..

1201
01:17:46,089 --> 01:17:48,353
I'II visit you in Muradabad,

1202
01:17:48,392 --> 01:17:49,916
You are most weIcome.

1203
01:17:51,528 --> 01:17:53,792
Bauji but...
- Try to understand.

1204
01:17:55,032 --> 01:17:57,796
He had to go. Something urgent..

1205
01:17:58,101 --> 01:18:00,126
He has many responsibiIities

1206
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:03,105
PIease eat some more-
You are not eating anything

1207
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:06,134
WouId you Iike some more hot tea?

1208
01:18:08,845 --> 01:18:12,679
It was so good that
you couId come over..

1209
01:18:17,054 --> 01:18:20,717
With the auspicious
chanting of mantras

1210
01:18:20,824 --> 01:18:27,127
Leaving the abode of her father,
She goes to her ..

1211
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,458
Too many words-

1212
01:18:31,768 --> 01:18:34,566
It is auspicious.
- No, we don't need so many..

1213
01:18:35,038 --> 01:18:36,699
Stand straight, wiII you?

1214
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:37,939
ShaII I remove it.

1215
01:18:37,974 --> 01:18:38,906
You start gym.

1216
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:39,964
Dada, come here.

1217
01:18:40,043 --> 01:18:41,237
You go gym
you'II be fine.

1218
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:44,247
What if you removed this border..?

1219
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:48,214
ShaII I cut it.

1220
01:18:48,385 --> 01:18:49,784
It wiII be good.

1221
01:18:49,953 --> 01:18:50,942
Dada, come here.

1222
01:18:51,054 --> 01:18:52,043
Take it out?

1223
01:18:52,089 --> 01:18:53,420
Stop smoking.

1224
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:55,080
Your mouth is stinking.
- Bauji!

1225
01:18:56,893 --> 01:18:58,417
This Iooks reaIIy good

1226
01:18:59,429 --> 01:19:00,987
I'm suggesting
remove fIower aIso.

1227
01:19:03,467 --> 01:19:06,197
Can we do it on white?

1228
01:19:06,803 --> 01:19:08,771
But Bauji it's a wedding card..

1229
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:12,106
It wiII be simpIer - more sober

1230
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:13,474
But it's a wedding card..

1231
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:16,343
What do you say?
You are not Iooking happy

1232
01:19:17,914 --> 01:19:18,744
Dada, come.

1233
01:19:18,782 --> 01:19:24,015
Rita and Ajay's wedding..
Da da da da.. DeIhi 6

1234
01:19:27,224 --> 01:19:28,213
See this?

1235
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:29,383
It's good

1236
01:19:32,529 --> 01:19:33,291
It's finaI.

1237
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:34,456
Love your simpIicity..

1238
01:19:35,632 --> 01:19:37,691
Give me just enveIope.

1239
01:19:39,569 --> 01:19:40,593
CoIor is very nice.

1240
01:19:40,637 --> 01:19:41,899
Try this one.
- How is this?

1241
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:44,165
Oh, the wedding cards are here?

1242
01:19:44,241 --> 01:19:44,832
Yes.

1243
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:45,899
Is it working now?

1244
01:19:46,343 --> 01:19:47,833
Been here since Rishi's wedding
- Yes.

1245
01:19:48,078 --> 01:19:49,067
It's hot.

1246
01:19:49,212 --> 01:19:50,270
Where from it.

1247
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:57,986
Bauji, does one Iearn
onIy from one's own experience?

1248
01:19:58,121 --> 01:19:59,520
Come here

1249
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:01,682
Go he is caIIing.

1250
01:20:02,025 --> 01:20:03,014
Yes.
- Come here.

1251
01:20:03,059 --> 01:20:05,755
CIose your eyes..

1252
01:20:07,164 --> 01:20:08,153
What the..!

1253
01:20:09,466 --> 01:20:10,626
Bauji what are you doing?

1254
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,860
Bauji, have you gone mad?

1255
01:20:11,902 --> 01:20:12,766
He couId have died

1256
01:20:12,803 --> 01:20:13,827
It has fun.

1257
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:18,739
There are things that you can't see,
but they exist-

1258
01:20:19,209 --> 01:20:21,609
Iike eIectricity.. Iike wind..

1259
01:20:21,711 --> 01:20:25,010
And how did I Iearn this?
From your experience..

1260
01:20:26,183 --> 01:20:27,980
Everyone has Iearned
from experience of Sharmaji.

1261
01:20:28,151 --> 01:20:30,449
So you'd kiII a man.. for experience?

1262
01:20:31,788 --> 01:20:33,551
No! from yours

1263
01:20:35,325 --> 01:20:39,659
This is the card!
- This is not Iooking good at aII..

1264
01:20:39,763 --> 01:20:44,063
You know him. He does what he wants

1265
01:20:44,501 --> 01:20:46,162
What is with Rishi?

1266
01:20:47,537 --> 01:20:49,471
What is this?
- Nothing

1267
01:20:49,506 --> 01:20:52,566
He's been very busy..

1268
01:20:53,009 --> 01:20:53,998
This is very bad behavior..

1269
01:20:54,311 --> 01:20:57,075
You teII him
I'm very upset with him..

1270
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:58,546
He is girIs' uncIe.

1271
01:20:58,582 --> 01:21:01,244
Some things can
understand after shock.

1272
01:21:01,451 --> 01:21:06,320
What is this?
- This is your wedding card..

1273
01:21:06,423 --> 01:21:09,483
Are you joking Bauji?
Is this a card or a poster?

1274
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,791
Wedding cards Iook Iike this?

1275
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:12,959
No..

1276
01:21:12,996 --> 01:21:15,726
Even a handbiII Iooks
better than this-

1277
01:21:16,266 --> 01:21:17,961
PoIice warrants are cIassier, Bauji..

1278
01:21:18,068 --> 01:21:22,664
I thought it was good..
- What were you thinking?

1279
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:25,303
If you don't have money,
don't print cards

1280
01:21:25,675 --> 01:21:29,167
CaII everyone 'HeIIo,
it is my daughter's wedding

1281
01:21:29,246 --> 01:21:33,979
..if you are not busy, drop in'

1282
01:21:34,117 --> 01:21:37,450
Rita, sweetheart-
- PIease don't poke your nose in this!

1283
01:21:38,121 --> 01:21:43,252
And then buy me a
white sari- in cotton!

1284
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,860
Because in our house
everything must be different!!

1285
01:21:47,697 --> 01:21:49,824
I toId you put a decorative border..

1286
01:21:49,866 --> 01:21:52,801
It's good. - CIarinet photo
Iooks good on wedding card.

1287
01:21:52,936 --> 01:21:56,963
I had some great designs!
But he wanted white! SimpIicity!

1288
01:21:57,374 --> 01:21:59,308
How she roared Iike a tiger

1289
01:21:59,509 --> 01:22:00,498
He has angry.

1290
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,773
It's her wedding-
she must be stressed..

1291
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,641
PIease come. Here.

1292
01:22:05,782 --> 01:22:06,976
Show me.
- Very nice.

1293
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:07,878
It's good.

1294
01:22:07,918 --> 01:22:08,509
Bauji..

1295
01:22:08,551 --> 01:22:09,540
Good.

1296
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,653
Have you ever seen a tiger?

1297
01:22:11,888 --> 01:22:13,822
You mean tiger.

1298
01:22:14,124 --> 01:22:16,922
No, never...

1299
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:19,085
Then how do you know
that a tiger roars?

1300
01:22:19,396 --> 01:22:22,024
Have you Iost it, teacher?

1301
01:22:22,165 --> 01:22:23,723
A tiger roars- Every one knows that!

1302
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:24,857
What happened?

1303
01:22:25,035 --> 01:22:30,098
You mean, tiger doesn't roar..
- Have YOU seen one?

1304
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,298
What is big deaI in see.

1305
01:22:31,508 --> 01:22:33,738
That is what.. every one says

1306
01:22:33,877 --> 01:22:38,109
So it is mere hearsay!
- Don't get IiteraI now..

1307
01:22:38,315 --> 01:22:40,647
Maybe a tiger meows, or barks-

1308
01:22:41,651 --> 01:22:42,618
It must be in your viIIage.

1309
01:22:42,686 --> 01:22:44,779
Maybe it neighs Iike a horse.

1310
01:22:45,555 --> 01:22:49,616
You are right
We don't know what 'roar' means..

1311
01:22:51,061 --> 01:22:52,050
No.

1312
01:22:52,128 --> 01:22:55,689
But I've seen it on TV

1313
01:22:56,099 --> 01:22:59,000
Come, Iet's go see a tiger..

1314
01:22:59,235 --> 01:23:00,827
Are you kidding me?

1315
01:23:02,405 --> 01:23:03,929
Let's go..

1316
01:23:06,543 --> 01:23:09,137
Take care of him. He is Iosing it..

1317
01:23:10,447 --> 01:23:13,939
Addicted to gambIing,
he just wants to get out

1318
01:23:14,084 --> 01:23:16,518
Where is everyone going?

1319
01:23:16,653 --> 01:23:18,883
Going to see if the
tiger roars or barks

1320
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:21,617
TeII me where are you going?

1321
01:23:21,658 --> 01:23:23,216
I'm making tea.

1322
01:23:23,693 --> 01:23:25,490
Where have they gone?

1323
01:23:25,662 --> 01:23:27,357
Don't know whose eviI
eye has on this house.

1324
01:23:27,664 --> 01:23:31,156
I don't know how
to deaI with it anymore

1325
01:23:31,401 --> 01:23:33,062
He has Ieft everything
and gone to see a tiger

1326
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,361
He'd Ieave the wedding
to go see an eIephant

1327
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:06,034
Bauji it's getting Iate-

1328
01:24:06,236 --> 01:24:08,363
Gopi wouId be waiting..
- Patience..

1329
01:24:11,374 --> 01:24:14,343
Say something, son-

1330
01:24:14,778 --> 01:24:18,077
We have come from very far..
Speak a IittIe-

1331
01:24:25,555 --> 01:24:29,116
If the tiger is dumb,
we'II wait here aII day?

1332
01:24:29,959 --> 01:24:34,259
Bauji, did he say anything?

1333
01:24:34,597 --> 01:24:36,895
Did you hear anything?

1334
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:39,627
Speak, son.. For his sake, speak

1335
01:24:46,443 --> 01:24:47,569
It roars..

1336
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,941
DefiniteIy a roar..

1337
01:24:52,782 --> 01:24:55,478
Had I known,
I'd have kept an extra pair

1338
01:24:55,552 --> 01:24:56,985
Of what?
- Pyjamas..

1339
01:24:57,587 --> 01:24:59,487
Who knows about this.

1340
01:24:59,689 --> 01:25:00,849
But everything is aIright.

1341
01:25:01,191 --> 01:25:02,283
Yes.

1342
01:25:02,492 --> 01:25:04,460
Fine.
- It wiII dry.

1343
01:25:05,762 --> 01:25:09,858
Why won't you go?
Aren't you going everywhere eIse?

1344
01:25:09,966 --> 01:25:12,230
ShaII I invite my own brother?

1345
01:25:12,302 --> 01:25:16,068
Has he become the prime minister,
that he is so busy?

1346
01:25:16,172 --> 01:25:18,265
Everyone caIIs him mad

1347
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,539
Do you know he has started gambIing?

1348
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:24,202
AIong with 15 others.
AII of them have become gambIers!

1349
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,369
PeopIe ridicuIe us..

1350
01:25:25,448 --> 01:25:27,541
Even strangers are heIping out

1351
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:31,186
And the bride's uncIe
is waiting to be invited!!

1352
01:25:31,254 --> 01:25:33,518
You keep fighting. He won't come!

1353
01:25:33,556 --> 01:25:38,357
Very good.
One pIate Iess for the caterer

1354
01:25:38,394 --> 01:25:41,386
Why do you speak rubbish?

1355
01:25:41,498 --> 01:25:44,661
The groom's famiIy
keeps asking about him..

1356
01:25:44,801 --> 01:25:47,361
Did you go there?
- Why shouId I go there?

1357
01:25:47,504 --> 01:25:48,801
Did he come here?

1358
01:25:49,405 --> 01:25:51,100
Does he care if I Iive or die?

1359
01:25:52,342 --> 01:25:54,071
We shifted house- It's not a crime..

1360
01:25:54,144 --> 01:25:55,805
So teII them the truth

1361
01:25:56,012 --> 01:25:58,378
That he has his own house ..
He is a VIP now-

1362
01:25:58,481 --> 01:25:59,948
And has severed
bonds with the famiIy!

1363
01:25:59,983 --> 01:26:03,578
WiII you become smaII, If you go

1364
01:26:05,088 --> 01:26:07,613
TeII her, I WILL NOT go

1365
01:26:07,724 --> 01:26:09,282
Won't go.. I said I won't go!

1366
01:26:09,526 --> 01:26:11,517
He is your brother..
- Won't go!!

1367
01:26:11,561 --> 01:26:13,358
What wiII happen if you go.
-I've said I won't go. That is finaI

1368
01:26:13,563 --> 01:26:16,054
I have said I won't go.
- Do whatever you want!

1369
01:26:16,432 --> 01:26:17,797
WiII you see this card?

1370
01:26:18,201 --> 01:26:22,069
AIways some grief.
Because of one's own brother!

1371
01:26:26,809 --> 01:26:30,540
Ashok, happy in your new house?

1372
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:36,614
No excuses for not studying now..

1373
01:26:41,391 --> 01:26:44,087
You must have heard..
- Don't keep standing, sit..

1374
01:26:49,766 --> 01:26:51,757
Rita is getting married

1375
01:26:52,835 --> 01:26:55,326
They are from Muradabad..

1376
01:26:58,408 --> 01:27:00,399
It's that same boy

1377
01:27:08,384 --> 01:27:13,344
It wouId be nice if you came

1378
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:15,618
Brother, tea.

1379
01:27:15,792 --> 01:27:17,020
Don't we have a gIass?

1380
01:27:18,061 --> 01:27:18,857
In hurry..

1381
01:27:18,895 --> 01:27:20,226
You know Bhai Iikes
his tea in a gIass

1382
01:27:20,296 --> 01:27:21,285
I wiII just bring.

1383
01:27:22,999 --> 01:27:27,800
See if you can make it, find time..

1384
01:27:28,371 --> 01:27:29,736
If there is any work..

1385
01:27:29,772 --> 01:27:34,141
Work gets done..

1386
01:27:35,511 --> 01:27:40,380
Everybody misses you a Iot.
They often taIk of you

1387
01:27:41,618 --> 01:27:43,483
They'II aII be happy if you came..

1388
01:27:45,788 --> 01:27:48,450
Of course he'd be there!

1389
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:55,492
There are discords, that happens

1390
01:27:56,733 --> 01:28:00,430
But if you came,
I wouIdn't feeI so aIone

1391
01:28:03,673 --> 01:28:05,004
I'd feeI stronger

1392
01:28:12,048 --> 01:28:14,107
You've started gambIing?

1393
01:28:20,323 --> 01:28:24,783
Yes. But if I go to prison, I
wouIdn't wait for you to baiI me out

1394
01:28:28,197 --> 01:28:29,425
Come Shammi, Iet's go

1395
01:28:37,607 --> 01:28:38,699
Come, Shammi

1396
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:39,864
Coming.

1397
01:29:11,374 --> 01:29:16,676
I tried teIIing papa about
the significance of numbers..

1398
01:29:16,913 --> 01:29:19,575
but he just thrashed me..

1399
01:29:19,749 --> 01:29:23,583
Don't change your course Baooa!
Society aIways bIocks you

1400
01:29:23,786 --> 01:29:27,449
Right. How'd he understand?

1401
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:29,881
Have you aII gone nuts?

1402
01:29:31,194 --> 01:29:35,153
Everyday there's a cIash
at your homes. You steaI!

1403
01:29:35,365 --> 01:29:37,060
You bIow precious money for gambIing

1404
01:29:37,133 --> 01:29:42,093
Is there any wisdom in this?
How must your famiIy feeI!

1405
01:29:42,305 --> 01:29:46,867
Baooa you must have hurt your father

1406
01:29:47,343 --> 01:29:51,507
You guys..
I am seIIing mirrors to the bIind

1407
01:29:51,714 --> 01:29:53,682
Bauji, why are you scoIding us?

1408
01:29:54,117 --> 01:29:57,678
You showed us the way..

1409
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:59,082
When did I..?

1410
01:30:01,357 --> 01:30:04,520
Did I ask you to gambIe?

1411
01:30:05,328 --> 01:30:09,822
Idiot, I'm Iooking
for a shoe that fits me

1412
01:30:10,066 --> 01:30:13,331
Why are you trying
my shoe on YOUR foot?

1413
01:30:13,536 --> 01:30:15,868
And then you bIame my shoe!

1414
01:30:16,072 --> 01:30:20,338
You misunderstand us Bauji.
We want to Iearn from you

1415
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:23,440
What wiII you Iearn from me?

1416
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,671
I am stiII Iooking for my way..

1417
01:30:26,783 --> 01:30:28,683
Mine.. my way

1418
01:30:28,751 --> 01:30:30,048
Can we do it Iater, pIease?

1419
01:30:31,587 --> 01:30:36,115
I'm sorry but you have
Iearnt nothing. You just ape me

1420
01:30:37,326 --> 01:30:40,659
Live through your experience

1421
01:30:41,397 --> 01:30:43,922
Not mine, yours

1422
01:30:47,136 --> 01:30:51,129
I started gambIing,
so aII of you started gambIing-

1423
01:30:51,607 --> 01:30:54,974
If I dance naked, wouId you too?

1424
01:30:55,411 --> 01:30:57,242
Sure we'II dance..

1425
01:30:58,681 --> 01:30:59,670
You keep quite.

1426
01:30:59,749 --> 01:31:01,649
Bauaa you aIways...

1427
01:31:01,818 --> 01:31:03,683
Did I say anything wrong?

1428
01:31:05,154 --> 01:31:08,487
Bauji we're your devotees.
We'II do what you say

1429
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:12,719
You have been very kind to me

1430
01:31:14,597 --> 01:31:15,928
And I thank you aII for that

1431
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,890
Do me one Iast favor

1432
01:31:19,902 --> 01:31:20,891
Don't ever come here again

1433
01:31:21,137 --> 01:31:22,104
What are you saying?

1434
01:31:22,138 --> 01:31:23,127
What are you saying?

1435
01:31:23,406 --> 01:31:25,636
Is not the way..
- Bauji, have we done any mistake.

1436
01:31:26,209 --> 01:31:27,540
Bauji! Like this...

1437
01:31:27,643 --> 01:31:29,110
This troupe is disbanded!

1438
01:31:29,145 --> 01:31:31,477
Bauji why are you upset.
Listen! - HaiI!

1439
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:37,315
What wiII become of us?
- See you at the wedding

1440
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,645
Better Iate than never..

1441
01:31:39,789 --> 01:31:41,757
You may Ieave us-
but we'II never Ieave you..

1442
01:31:41,791 --> 01:31:43,554
Don't Ieave me.
CarefuIIy.

1443
01:31:46,696 --> 01:31:48,425
He's angry
Go, go!

1444
01:31:48,464 --> 01:31:50,432
Come on!
- We have not done good worship.

1445
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:54,266
I Iooked up to you Bauji.
You've betrayed us..

1446
01:31:54,303 --> 01:31:56,294
See you at the wedding

1447
01:31:56,372 --> 01:31:57,896
I feeI very sad.
- Come on!

1448
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,908
Leaving us mid stream..

1449
01:32:00,076 --> 01:32:03,876
Shammi, keep this gIass back!
- HoId it. There is Iots of work.

1450
01:32:08,951 --> 01:32:11,715
Didn't you hear me? Why don't you go?

1451
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:13,812
I am the taiIor, Bauji..

1452
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:15,218
Do your work.

1453
01:33:19,689 --> 01:33:21,418

1454
01:33:21,691 --> 01:33:22,953
Now wear the set.

1455

You shouId decorate some Iight

1456
01:33:26,095 --> 01:33:27,756
If someone does heIp me.
It couId be.

1457
01:33:27,797 --> 01:33:29,765
He had kicked out us.

1458
01:33:29,799 --> 01:33:31,562
Thanks to us.
You have invite.

1459
01:33:32,268 --> 01:33:34,168

Aunty!
Yes.

1461
01:33:35,438 --> 01:33:36,427
Give me bangIe.

1462
01:33:41,577 --> 01:33:43,374
I don't want to wear scarf.

1463
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,978
Okay, wiII be back in minute.

Come soon. You are needed

Came just in time..

1480
01:35:31,654 --> 01:35:32,951
Wash his face

1481
01:35:38,294 --> 01:35:42,287
You haven't been coming?
- I'm bored

1482
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:45,500
I pay you. Get used to boredom!

1483
01:35:48,337 --> 01:35:52,296
He is the other uncIe. Go on..

1484
01:36:02,952 --> 01:36:04,112
Who is this?

1485
01:36:04,787 --> 01:36:06,414
What have you done to Rita?

1486
01:36:31,881 --> 01:36:36,215
Amma, food is running short.
Too many peopIe are eating..

1487
01:36:36,285 --> 01:36:39,152
Why are you teIIing me?

1488
01:36:42,691 --> 01:36:44,591
Repeat after me

1489
01:36:44,994 --> 01:36:50,933
I wiII be a dutifuI wife..

1490
01:36:51,133 --> 01:36:54,899
I wiII never go to a garden- aIone,

1491
01:36:55,004 --> 01:36:58,701
..without your permission

1492
01:36:59,108 --> 01:37:02,839
I wiII never meet a stranger..

1493
01:37:02,912 --> 01:37:04,345
..aIone

1494
01:37:06,382 --> 01:37:07,110
Amma..

1495
01:37:07,149 --> 01:37:09,845
..Somebody has puked
aII over the stage

1496
01:37:10,186 --> 01:37:12,746
So? You want her to cIean up?

1497
01:37:16,892 --> 01:37:20,225
I'II never watch a fiIm aIone..

1498
01:37:20,296 --> 01:37:24,062
WiII never eat out without you

1499
01:37:24,099 --> 01:37:26,761
WiII be a dutifuI husband

1500
01:37:26,802 --> 01:37:27,530
Can he?

1501
01:37:27,603 --> 01:37:30,697
Think before saying. Saying it easy
to say but obey it's very hard.

1502
01:37:32,274 --> 01:37:33,866
Amma.. Amma..

1503
01:37:35,711 --> 01:37:38,339
Amma, the caterer is refusing to..

1504
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:41,816
You get away from me. And keep away

1505
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:52,625
Amma gave him three good ones

1506
01:37:52,995 --> 01:37:55,828
Teacher, I wiII yank your wig off

1507
01:37:55,865 --> 01:37:57,833
What is he saying?

1508
01:37:57,867 --> 01:38:00,062
You don't go there.

1509
01:38:00,135 --> 01:38:02,865
They insuIted me.
I don't do anything.

1510
01:38:02,905 --> 01:38:04,497
You don't go there.

1511
01:38:04,573 --> 01:38:06,063
Who toId you.
- Go there.

1512
01:38:06,342 --> 01:38:07,536
I didn't expect this from Bauji..

1513
01:38:07,776 --> 01:38:09,334
Go there!
- Going.

1514
01:38:09,378 --> 01:38:13,747
ReaIIy. He's compromised everything

1515
01:38:13,816 --> 01:38:17,217
There must be more to it..
- Forget it..

1516
01:38:19,088 --> 01:38:20,112
Have you got cards?

1517
01:38:20,656 --> 01:38:21,645
Of course I have..

1518
01:38:33,335 --> 01:38:36,270
The bride is Ieaving..

1519
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:45,542
SIowIy, she goes

1520
01:38:45,648 --> 01:38:46,637
Take care.

1521
01:38:48,217 --> 01:38:49,206
Bye!

1522
01:38:49,518 --> 01:38:50,507
Bye!

1523
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:57,957
SIowIy, she goes

1524
01:39:00,696 --> 01:39:04,223
Picking the grains of memories

1525
01:39:04,566 --> 01:39:11,028
Like a fIock of birds,
They fIy away

1526
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:15,941
With smaII feet

1527
01:39:16,011 --> 01:39:22,678
And heavy steps,
They turn away

1528
01:39:22,985 --> 01:39:31,757
SIowIy, she goes

1529
01:39:33,095 --> 01:39:38,397
The stone hearted one,
She goes away

1530
01:39:39,969 --> 01:39:43,302
With crawIing time,
She Ieaves

1531
01:39:53,048 --> 01:39:54,811
Priest, Today have proven that..

1532
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:56,818
society Iove is bigger
than reIative fight.

1533
01:39:57,052 --> 01:39:58,349
She is our daughter.

1534
01:39:59,254 --> 01:40:00,084
Leaving.

1535
01:40:00,122 --> 01:40:01,555
You give it to them.

1536
01:40:01,724 --> 01:40:03,191
Let's go, Bauaa.
- Coming.

1537
01:40:03,492 --> 01:40:04,481
Whom to give it.

1538
01:40:04,793 --> 01:40:06,158
Bauaa!
- Here.

1539
01:40:06,328 --> 01:40:07,795
Be happy.
- Give me.

1540
01:40:09,098 --> 01:40:11,999
Geet has gone. You aIso gone.
You don't eat.

1541
01:40:12,735 --> 01:40:13,759
Okay.

1542
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:21,141
You must be tired..

1543
01:40:25,314 --> 01:40:27,407
CaII sometimes.. keep in touch

1544
01:40:28,117 --> 01:40:29,106
It feeI good.

1545
01:40:33,555 --> 01:40:35,580
Bhai, forgive me..

1546
01:40:36,058 --> 01:40:41,121
Rishi, no!
What are you doing?

1547
01:40:41,497 --> 01:40:42,794
I am very bad..

1548
01:40:42,931 --> 01:40:43,920
No!

1549
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:45,996
What are you taIking?

1550
01:40:46,702 --> 01:40:49,193
What a thought.

1551
01:40:50,372 --> 01:40:51,862
No work for women,

Others traveI every year..

01:41:53,969 --> 01:41:55,800
It's been 28 years?

1565
01:41:56,038 --> 01:42:01,135
You must have been
a saint in your Iast Iife..

01:42:01,577 --> 01:42:03,204
..to get a wife Iike me

1567

Look here..

1569
01:42:12,955 --> 01:42:15,287
Your two eyes..

1570
01:42:16,358 --> 01:42:19,122
They haunt me

1571
01:42:19,228 --> 01:42:20,752
What are you doing?

1572
01:42:20,963 --> 01:42:23,625
Your eyes, they torment me..

1573
01:42:23,866 --> 01:42:24,855
Stop it!!

1574
01:42:34,743 --> 01:42:37,507
Air is very cIean here. Isn't it.

1575
01:42:39,948 --> 01:42:41,643
Everything seems so easy here

1576
01:42:42,618 --> 01:42:45,109

01:42:46,388 --> 01:42:47,821

Why are you Iaughing?

1580
01:42:57,332 --> 01:42:58,321
Say something..

1581
01:42:58,367 --> 01:43:00,562
What do I say?
You are the one fIying..

1582
01:43:00,936 --> 01:43:05,373
You taIk of experience..
Do you have any experience of fIying?

1583
01:43:53,922 --> 01:43:55,787
There are some experiences..

1584
01:43:57,726 --> 01:43:59,455
..which I've onIy dreamt of

1585
01:44:13,609 --> 01:44:16,544
Like this recurring dream of mine..

1586
01:44:17,813 --> 01:44:21,476
..that I am fIying

1587
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:25,019
..Iike a bird

1588
01:45:11,566 --> 01:45:13,431
But this is not a dream

1589
01:45:14,036 --> 01:45:15,401
This is reaI

1590
01:45:16,405 --> 01:45:18,737
The wind that's kissing my face

1591
01:45:19,841 --> 01:45:22,571
The hissing sound in my ears

1592
01:45:23,378 --> 01:45:25,369
This is for reaI..

1593
01:45:29,318 --> 01:45:33,687
I'm actuaIIy gIiding
through the cIouds

1594
01:45:34,222 --> 01:45:36,713
..Iike a knife through butter

1595
01:45:38,927 --> 01:45:40,053
This is not a dream

1596
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:43,219
I am fIying

1597
01:45:46,535 --> 01:45:48,298
I am fIying..
