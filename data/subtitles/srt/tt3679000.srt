1
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,234
Good evening India!

2
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,575
From Mumbai to Manipur...

3
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:43,705
Delhi to Dimapur...

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,444
roads wear a deserted look
all over the country.

5
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,383
People have taken
the day off from work.

6
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,081
Everyone has eagerly
tuned their TV sets

7
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,180
to this amazing dance show
Hum Kisise Kum Nahin!

8
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,522
And everyone is waiting to watch
their favourite team

9
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,426
from Mumbafs Nalasopara -
Mumbai Stunners!

10
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,055
Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach!

11
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,261
Quiet! Lizards...

12
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:10,135
I am Raghavs uncle... Raghavji.

13
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,368
He is my 'original
'full time' nephew.

14
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,706
When he was little, he used to
lie down and dance.

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,750
I would ask him,
'Son, what are you doing?'

16
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,644
He would say, 'Uncle, I am dancing

17
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,312
like a fish.'

18
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,320
'Fish dance!'

19
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,182
Vernon! What can I say about him?

20
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,521
He makes everyone laugh.

21
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,289
He says,
'anybody can deliver a pizza.'

22
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,558
'But a smile...
if you can deliver that...

23
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,462
it's an accomplishment.'

24
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,296
Vernon, keep up the good work!

25
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,131
Vernon, we love you!

26
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,261
All the best!
- Keep it up!

27
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,799
Vinnie! She is very cool...

28
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,231
Not only is her style cool...

29
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,535
she is a cool person too.

30
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,768
She is coming on television,
which is why

31
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,169
she hasn't come to work.

32
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,405
But her clients are
waiting only for her.

33
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,772
Suru! We call him Suru here.

34
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:50,537
It's his nickname.

35
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,105
The boys call him that.

36
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,277
So I told him that he should do

37
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,549
whatever his heart is set on.

38
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,352
'Move ahead in life.
I will support you.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,723
I will give you as much money
as you want.'

40
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,013
Hey, Suru! You aren't ready as yet?

41
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,285
Pass me that.

42
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,758
Here. Now hurry up.

43
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,160
And is there anything to eat?
I am starving.

44
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,459
Yes, there is an apple inside.

45
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,158
Has everyone reached?

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
Everyone is there.

47
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,393
What!

48
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,301
Vinnie is waiting for you downstairs.
Get dressed quickly.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,430
Hey!

50
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,635
Before we begin the biggest
dance celebration...

51
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,337
Let me introduce ourjudges.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,606
Ladies and gentlemen!

53
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,806
Please welcome...

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,674
Mrs. Sita Devi ji...

55
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,445
Terrence Lewis...

56
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,077
And Remo D'Souza!

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,662
Welcome to the biggest
dance show in India

58
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,198
<i>'Adkzfion Dee' presents...</i>

59
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:19,067
'Hum Kisise Kum Nahin'
powered by Reliance Trends.

60
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,005
That is being watched since 12 weeks
in 180 countries by millions.

61
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,666
Let's start this programme

62
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,439
with a breathtaking and
mind blowing performance...

63
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,502
from Team Illuminati

64
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,570
And the next group <i>is...</i>

65
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,172
J5!

66
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,025
Where were you guys!

67
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,116
Sorry... Come on boys!

68
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,559
We have to win this!

69
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,064
Let's go for it!!

70
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,496
We have a team here...

71
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,500
and every time they
performs on this stage...

72
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:15,096
they makes us realize that Indian
dancers are no less than anyone!

73
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,008
- And we have here your favourite team
- Mumbai Stunners!

74
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,588
- Wow! What a performancel!

75
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,258
- The audience has already given
them a standing ovation.

76
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,164
- But, let's see
what the judges have to say.

77
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,329
- So, let's hear it for
Mumbai Stunners.

78
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:34,201
Yes. The audience has given you
a standing ovation

79
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,341
- Yes, absolutely!

80
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,439
But for this amazing act...

81
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,345
I have to congratulate...

82
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,147
that awesome team whose name is...

83
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,815
Philippine All Stars!

84
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,452
Why Suresh,
will you say it or should I?

85
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,627
I think I will say it.

86
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,495
This entire act, its every step...

87
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:03,003
from the formation to the flip...

88
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,331
has been copied!

89
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,372
What do you have to say, Suresh?

90
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,136
No, sir. We have not copied the act.

91
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,009
Shut up!

92
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,580
Not just copy, but your team
has also cheated.

93
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,552
You have written that the act is
choreographed by Suresh and Vernon.

94
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,746
But it's not even your choreography!

95
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,288
The problem with people like you
is that you pick someone else's ideas

96
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,555
and creativity from the internet...

97
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,221
copy it and perform the act on stage.

98
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,764
And the poor souls who do not know...

99
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,260
that you have copied the act...

100
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,359
applaud and vote for you.
Correct?

101
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,127
Very sad!

102
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:39,301
- Suresh, aren't you
Padmashri DurgadevFs son?

103
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,334
Yes, madam.

104
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,473
- Whether anyone else
knows this or not...

105
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:53,389
but we believe that you understand
very clearly that dance is no joke.

106
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,127
It is worship. It is a discipline...

107
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,224
A discipline your mother lived by.

108
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:05,298
I cannot believe that you
can do something like this.

109
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:13,037
Your mother, who died with
her anklets on...

110
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,175
for whom dance was everything.

111
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,711
Shame on you!

112
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,179
I think you cannot continue
in the competition.

113
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,715
You guys can leave.
- Tell them we didn't cheat.

114
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,758
Sir!

115
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,587
Think original next time.
You may go.

116
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,122
Suru...

117
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:43,232
In summery breeze, flows the colour

118
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:48,040
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

119
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:53,746
In summery breeze, flows the colour

120
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:58,721
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

121
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,691
The colour of your tradition

122
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,421
The colour of your love

123
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:09,728
It has brought the
colour of your success

124
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,526
The colour of your tradition

125
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,162
The colour of your love

126
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:20,404
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

127
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,507
<i>'</i> Hi!

128
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,580
Hi! Vinnie, I need a new haircut.
Will you manage a Katrina Kaif?

129
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,674
An exact copy.

130
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,784
Who am I asking?

131
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,380
You are an expert at copying,
isn't it?

132
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:37,086
Oh Mother...

133
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,798
My Mother...

134
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:50,700
Did your father build this place
so that you could dance?

135
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,398
Enough!

136
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,738
No more dancing from today.

137
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,772
From now on, you will
concentrate on work.

138
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,515
We've had to face the music as well.

139
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,573
What happened?
- We are also answerable to our families...

140
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,174
What's wrong?

141
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,617
I won't be a part
of this group anymore!

142
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,619
Tell me, what happened?

143
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:04,644
What is it?

144
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,586
No more, Suru.
I'm sorry...

145
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,123
Why don't you tell us what happened?

146
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,453
Why are you going out?

147
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,254
Where are you going?

148
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,517
What's the problem, boys?

149
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,265
- Pizza, sir.

150
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,735
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening...

151
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,230
Ah, so the pizza is free today?

152
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,603
Why would it be free, sir?

153
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,641
Because it's late.

154
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,703
No sir, it's just 25 minutes
by my watch.

155
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,745
Really?

156
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,744
But according to my watch
it's 35 minutes.

157
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,082
But sir, the delivery time...

158
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,743
This is wrong, sir.

159
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,715
Yes, yes! Go.

160
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,717
Sir, this is cheating.

161
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,089
And now you will teach me
what cheating is!

162
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,688
You guys are the biggest cheaters.

163
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,156
Listen, I will order pizza everyday.

164
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,530
And if YOU deliver it...
I will not pay a penny. Got it?

165
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,593
You can do whatever you want.
Get out.

166
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,568
Cheaters!

167
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,640
- Did you deliver late again?

168
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:58,436
Sorry, sir.

169
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,977
I explained it to you earlier.
What do you mean by sorry?

170
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,338
Does money grow on trees? Does it?
- No, sir.

171
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,149
- This is a last warning.

172
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,482
- Next time I will cut it
from your salary.

173
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,512
Oh Mother

174
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,525
Dear Mother

175
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,617
Hey, cheater.

176
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,356
Sorry... waiter!
Come here.

177
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,259
Vinnie, it's your client.

178
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,426
Come in.
- Coming.

179
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,169
My shadow dithers away from me

180
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,468
Please get me another one.
- Okay.

181
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,503
Go!

182
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:42,415
My shadow is your illusion

183
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:47,321
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

184
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:53,163
In summery breeze, flows the colour

185
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:58,395
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

186
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,097
The colour of your tradition

187
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,606
The colour of your love

188
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:09,135
It has brought the
colour of your success

189
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,738
The colour of your tradition

190
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,450
The colour of your love

191
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:19,251
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

192
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:26,221
In summery breeze, flows the colour
Fluttering in your warmth and affection

193
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,232
"This entire act, its every step..."

194
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,127
"from the formation to the flip..."

195
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,367
"has been copied!"

196
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:39,603
"- Your mother, who died with
her anklets on..."

197
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,545
"for whom dance was everything.
Shame on you!"

198
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:55,348
I have shamed you

199
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,452
I agree I have tarnished
your reputation

200
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
Mother

201
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,130
My mother

202
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,238
I have shamed you

203
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,669
Mother

204
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,278
My mother

205
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,754
You are in my soul,
In my every word

206
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,688
My stubbornness, my life

207
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,627
You are my deepest pain,
My ultimate consequence

208
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,029
You are my holy recitation

209
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,275
You are in my soul,
In my every word

210
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,241
My stubbornness, my life

211
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,176
You are my deepest pain,
My ultimate consequence

212
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,111
You are my holy recitation

213
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,013
You are in my prayer,
You are my hope

214
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,018
You are my path

215
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,678
You are my honour,
The blood in my veins

216
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,245
You are my all, my life

217
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:04,192
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

218
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:12,264
In summery breeze, flows the colour

219
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:17,171
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

220
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,689
Thank you!
Welcome to Comedy Nights.

221
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,158
Let me tell you...

222
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,025
if cheating was
included in the Olympics

223
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,394
Mumbai Stunners would surely win Gold.

224
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,761
Bigger cheaters than us!

225
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,194
I gave him an 80-rupee note
and requested for change.

226
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,668
He gave me two 40-rupee notes.

227
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,367
Stop! Senses transformed
Sights varied

228
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,106
And the boat changed
Altering the coast.

229
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,374
If you want to change this world,
You need to change your perspective.

230
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:06,151
What you want is neither
in your retreat Nor in your e><ile.

231
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,387
Introspect.
Everything is in your belief.

232
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,628
A stone faced hardship
And shattered to pebbles.

233
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:24,299
While another stone bore adversity
To become the seat of the Lord.

234
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,049
Hello Vinnie...

235
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:34,982
Suru.

236
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,143
Let's prepare a super performance.

237
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,712
We will rock the stage ne><t year.
Why are you worrying?

238
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,050
Next year is very far.
I have a solution right now.

239
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:43,684
What is it?

240
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,165
What is this?

241
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,327
The biggest hip-hop competition
is going to be held in Vegas.

242
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,600
You mean in America?
l-low will we go there'?

243
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,268
What did the judges say?

244
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,204
That we copied those guys!

245
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,335
I say let's go there and
take them head on.

246
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,674
- What rubbish!

247
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,077
We haven't managed
to do anything here.

248
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,615
What can we achieve there?

249
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,416
Suru is fully prepared.

250
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,777
The competition is in three months.

251
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,723
We will start a new team.

252
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,186
India's first dance team.

253
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,485
What are you saying, Suru!

254
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,495
In three months! Are you crazy?

255
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,689
You are being unrealistic!

256
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,596
In three months we'll make a team...
Go to America...

257
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,729
Look, if you guys support me...
I am sure we can get there.

258
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,101
And if you don't support me...

259
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,771
I will take some time
but I will surely make a team.

260
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,316
Let's go.

261
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:50,811
Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu!...

262
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,614
Get lost, you fool!

263
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,486
Dude, who are you?

264
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,546
Idiot!

265
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,021
He is asking me who I am?

266
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,762
Should I tell him or show him?

267
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,259
Show him!

268
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,408
I have spent
The whole day waiting

269
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:19,711
Every happiness is borrowed

270
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:24,780
Even my sorrows
Are one on one free

271
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,783
I was here yesterday
Am here today too

272
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:35,054
And will meet you tomorrow, too
Right here

273
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:41,035
O O O At happy hour!

274
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:45,538
O O O At happy hour!

275
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:51,275
All the worries will drown
In the first go!

276
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:55,751
O O O At happy hour!

277
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,551
O O O At happy hour!

278
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,144
The heart jumps with Joy!

279
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,683
The glass is empty
Pour!

280
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,755
The heart is stubborn

281
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,289
It doesn't listen to me

282
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,761
No boundaries to its stubbornness

283
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,692
It doesn't listen to me

284
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,529
There is no one like me

285
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,762
There's one and only me!

286
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,264
There is a lightening in my veins

287
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:57,173
Like a current passes through wire

288
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:03,416
One, two, three, four
At happy hour!

289
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:08,055
O O O At happy hour!

290
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:13,628
All the worries will drown
In the first go!

291
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:18,566
O O O At happy hour!

292
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,268
O O O At happy hour!

293
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,582
Bring out the naughtiness
Knock on the locks and doors

294
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,721
You are a bird, but break the cage
With the fury of your wings.

295
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,324
Smashed your slippers on the rug
The needle was lost in the haystack

296
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,495
But why did you run?
Don't let fear hold you!

297
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,735
O Mr. Naidu!
The Lord is inside you!

298
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,401
Be thick-skinned
Live life on the rocks

299
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,378
Gulp down La-la-life!

300
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,175
O O O At happy hour!

301
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,013
O O O At happy hour!

302
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,721
Sir!

303
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,161
This is the last one. Please.

304
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,298
Sir, you are superb!

305
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,464
Outstanding! Hats off to you, sir!

306
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,405
I know, man.
Shut up and get lost!

307
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,771
Sorry, sir.

308
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,668
Here, hold this.

309
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,770
Wait and watch...

310
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,282
One day we will go to America

311
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,147
for the hip-hop competition

312
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,014
and people like him will salute us.

313
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,020
What will they do?

314
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,051
Salute.

315
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,523
I know, man. Get lost.

316
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,256
Don't ever meet me again.

317
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,521
Go away, hippopotamus.

318
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,293
- All my money is over.

319
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,128
Sir, excuse me...

320
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,462
Excuse me.

321
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,560
I have won the bottle.
I don't want a bill.

322
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,002
Yes, you have won the bottle.

323
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,370
Yes, so let me drink.

324
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,635
Yes, sir. Drink up.

325
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,234
But you mentioned
the hip-hop competition in America.

326
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,507
Ah, yes. In Las Vegas.

327
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,009
Yes, sir.

328
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,982
Have you gone there?

329
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:15,741
I wanted to.

330
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,420
But right now I will go home.

331
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,992
I can drop you.
I have a bike.

332
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,496
Take me.

333
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:30,658
Yes, sir.

334
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,631
Take me.

335
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,313
By the way, sir, we've met
like in the movies.

336
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,244
I mean you dance like Michael Jackson

337
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,148
and have adopted
Indian superstar Rajni's style.

338
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,117
Do you agree'?

339
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,245
Left.

340
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:57,152
I didn't tell you earlier
but I have an entire team ready.

341
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,360
Right.

342
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,363
Right from here?
Actually, sir, even I am a dancer.

343
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,366
You may have seen me on television.
Do you watch television, sir?

344
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,560
Left.
- You left TV?

345
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,571
Anyway, I really feel
that we met by fate.

346
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:13,667
I mean, we needed a choreographer
and you, a team. You know like...

347
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,142
Right.

348
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,310
Okay, sir.

349
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,247
Yes, sir. I was saying...
will you teach us, sir?

350
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,078
Right.

351
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,173
Yes, sir, right.

352
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,186
So, will you take us to Vegas?
Tell me, sir.

353
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,482
Stop.

354
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,453
Sir. Vegas.

355
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,524
Vishnu sir! Vishnu sir...

356
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,397
At happy hour...

357
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,632
l-low was my dance'?

358
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,668
Sir, superb!

359
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,067
I know, man. Shut up!

360
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,097
He must be sleeping, isn't it?

361
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,738
Try again.

362
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,740
L-low can you trust someone
when they are drunk'?

363
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,611
L-low do you know
if he was saying the truth'?

364
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,346
He knows.

365
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,513
He said that this is an annual
international event since years

366
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,352
Suru, it has been years
since we have been knocking.

367
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,517
When will he open the door?

368
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,957
Shut up!

369
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,628
It is the door of fortune.
It will not open easily.

370
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,565
This door isn't leading to luck,
but a tippler.

371
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,503
- Hey, the door opened!

372
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,201
Come... come...
Be careful... inside.

373
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,398
Sir.

374
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,273
Sir?

375
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,170
Come... come...

376
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,112
Sir?

377
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,479
Vishnu sir.
- Vernon, check these sticky notes.

378
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,516
OMG!
- Not notes, but a whole project.

379
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,422
International hip-hop competition.

380
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,687
Whoa!

381
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,391
He's mapped out everything
about the competition.

382
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,093
Looks like he's all set to conquer...

383
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,566
The entire mission is ready.

384
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,574
From travel details
to the hotel rental.

385
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:57,377
I told you. He may be a loony tippler
but he is everyone's guru.

386
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,540
But where is this guru?

387
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,283
Quiet.

388
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,417
Come on.

389
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,320
Come on.

390
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,720
Vishnu sir.

391
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,519
Sir. Sir.

392
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,729
Shake him.

393
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:16,455
Sir.

394
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:18,723
Who is it?

395
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,968
Hi, sir.

396
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,169
Who are you, man?

397
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:26,636
Sir, this is Vernon, Raghav, Jack...
I am Vinnie and he's Suresh.

398
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,975
Sir, you were tipsy last night.
Then I paid your bill.

399
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,514
Then on the bike -
right, left, right, left...

400
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,113
Stop.
- Yes, you told me to stop like that.

401
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,117
Have you come here to get the money?

402
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,175
Sir, not money.

403
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,018
You spoke about the international
hip-hop competition.

404
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,225
Sir, you told me you would show me
the road to Vegas.

405
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,494
The road to Vegas!

406
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,000
Get out of here, go straight,
then take a left.

407
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,160
Take a taxi from the main road
to the airport.

408
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,531
Go... get lost!

409
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,695
What do you mean?

410
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,761
Get lost!

411
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,633
Sir, you promised.

412
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,668
Sir, you said that you need a group
and that group is here today.

413
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,237
I swear he said it.

414
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,407
Suru!

415
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,711
Vinnie, say something.

416
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:14,714
Sir, we all need a choreographer...
a mentor like you.

417
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,448
Sir, please.

418
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,320
I told you to leave.

419
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,421
Forget being a mentor.
Look at the bottle he's picked up.

420
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,023
I do not want a team.
- Sir!

421
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:24,725
Sir!

422
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,766
Sir, you are kidding, aren't you?
- Maybe.

423
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,044
Look at my face...

424
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,703
Bubbles!

425
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,610
Do you think I'm joking?

426
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,253
No more teaching...

427
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,792
Sir, have you stopped teaching dance?

428
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,554
Sir, didn't you mention
the other day...

429
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,655
Sir?

430
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,726
You had prepared for the competition.

431
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,505
And that you didn't have a team

432
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,303
You wanted to go to Vegas.

433
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,603
Are you crazy?

434
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,082
Whatever you may say...
he's a genius.

435
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,321
Did you see that board?
He is completely prepared.

436
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,360
Suru, is this tippler
a dancer as well?

437
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,098
Dancer?

438
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,030
He's the king of dancers.

439
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,091
He is excellent.

440
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,094
I cannot tell you...

441
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,430
He's outstanding...

442
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,735
I mean... he's... he's just...

443
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,676
He's praising someone else
for the first time!

444
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,476
This is unbelievable.

445
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,447
It will be unbelievable when our feet
dance to his steps.

446
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,484
If anyone can get
back our lost honour...

447
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,446
it is Vishnu sir!

448
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,046
What sort of a loony guy is he?
He drinks shampoo.

449
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,484
He must be downing conditioner.

450
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,454
And honour...
We will get it back when he agrees.

451
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,292
He will agree.
Leave that to me.

452
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,261
Done.

453
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,760
Suru...
- Yes?

454
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,300
Listen...

455
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,029
You always make some grand plan,

456
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,373
everyone gets excited and
leave their work and come to you.

457
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,137
But you...
- But what, Vinnie?

458
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,480
I am scared.

459
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,014
What if there is a problem
like the last time?

460
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,110
There won't be.

461
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,585
Do you trust me?

462
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,314
Do you?

463
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,648
Obviously.

464
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,194
- Come on guys...

465
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,091
Are you angry?
- Yes, sir.

466
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,781
L-low was my dance that clay'?

467
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:54,482
Sir, superb.

468
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,382
Shut up! I know, man.

469
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,183
Sir. Have it.

470
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,764
Sir, Vegas. Come on, sir.
Please.

471
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,697
What kind of guy is this?

472
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,629
What are you doing?

473
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,693
Oh, no!

474
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,239
What are you doing? No!

475
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:18,763
No... no!

476
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,273
Sir, the pizza is free.
- Get lost.

477
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,685
Wow! Wow! Wow!

478
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,284
Turn now.

479
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,064
What are you doing, sir?

480
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,441
I'm trying to ride the bike.
Sir, please.

481
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:07,580
"Get us a beverage."

482
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,082
Sir.

483
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,319
Please give us one chance.
We have a good team.

484
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,291
No chance!

485
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,293
Please agree, sir.

486
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,455
Sir, we want to represent India.
Give us one chance.

487
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,190
- Get lost!

488
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,493
Sir, Vegas.
- Get lost!

489
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,556
We love dancing. Please sir...
give us one chance.

490
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,000
- Get lost!

491
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,329
Sir, I have a plan.

492
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,303
I have told you so many times.

493
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,568
I can't teach you to dance. Get lost!

494
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,010
You okay?

495
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,148
Sir, what is this?

496
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,583
We are pleading so much.

497
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,217
Can you not see our hard work?

498
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,725
Can't you see Suru's efforts?

499
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,285
Vinnie, let's go.
- No please let me...

500
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,359
Suru has only one dream...

501
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,133
And he is waiting for the moment
you will agree.

502
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,796
And you are pushing him away?

503
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,300
Why are you behaving this way, sir?
Vvhy?

504
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,611
Because you are all cheaters.

505
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,412
All of you.

506
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,578
You stole the Philippine All Stars'
entire routine...

507
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,418
in Hum Kisi Se Kam Nahin.

508
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,480
Step by step!

509
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,350
The entire country saw it.

510
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,656
I recognized you immediately.

511
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,062
I didn't tell you though. Out!

512
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,200
Come on boys.

513
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,543
Sir, the world gave up on us...

514
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,273
but I thought you would
give us a chance.

515
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,375
Fine. We are cheaters.

516
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,419
But do you know who
the biggest cheater is here?

517
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,187
Sir, it is you.

518
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,583
We are only tricking the world.

519
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,585
But you are cheating yourself.

520
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,755
Your entire wall is covered
with these posters...

521
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,199
Have your dreams come true yet?

522
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,266
I thought that like us...
you too love dance.

523
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,974
But you are only...

524
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,235
Come on. Let's go.

525
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,037
It is not so easy to go to Vegas.

526
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,278
First, there will be
auditions in Bangalore.

527
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,680
Sir, we know the details.

528
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,111
The travel,
food and competition fee...

529
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,583
adds up to about
24-25 thousand rupees...

530
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,124
Sir, everything is arranged for.

531
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,450
Even the team is very good.
At least check us out once.

532
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,425
24, 25 thousand rupees
will not suffice.

533
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,395
Do you know the cost
of going to Vegas?

534
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,599
Twenty two lakhs sixty thousand.

535
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,695
Sir, if we win the
Bangalore competition...

536
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,533
even that amount will be arranged.

537
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,496
My boss, Shetty Anna...

538
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,735
who owns Desi Cocktail Bar...

539
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,166
will sponsor us.

540
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,405
He promised us.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,468
Please sir.
- Please.

542
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,206
Only you need to agree.

543
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,449
Say yes, sir...

544
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:50,779
Say yes...

545
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,551
Sir... sir...

546
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,024
- Please sir.

547
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,422
Yes!

548
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,393
Move aside. Our guru has come!

549
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,569
- Chotu get us tea.
- On Raghavs account.

550
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,318
WOW !

551
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,012
You guys practice here?

552
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,217
Yes, sir. Since we were kids.

553
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,683
It's Crocks' place.

554
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,594
Half Of it.

555
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,296
Half?

556
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,726
Father and uncle were partners.

557
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,033
After father's death,
I became the owner.

558
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,207
Crocks has cut a super deal
with his uncle.

559
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,606
Uncle continues his business outside

560
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,234
while we rehearse here every day.

561
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,607
Sir, my deal.

562
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,668
Yes. His deal.

563
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,579
Alright. Call the rest.

564
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,376
Sir...uh...

565
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,448
Sir... We are only so many.

566
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,251
Sir... Please sit.

567
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,361
The championships main event
is the group event.

568
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,295
Our team is small.

569
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,493
It's not enough.

570
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,436
We will need more people.

571
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,233
Sir... don't even go there.

572
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,104
We have been completely defamed.

573
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,274
Sir, after the HK2N competition we...

574
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,441
Sir... It is because of him...
that half of them left...

575
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,639
Because of me...

576
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,976
Guys!

577
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:26,981
Quiet...

578
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:27,709
Guys, please stop it!

579
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,517
Please.
- Sorry, sir.

580
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,246
We don't need a fight.

581
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,488
We need a solution to this problem.

582
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,150
Tell me one by one.

583
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,120
The one holding the flag will talk.

584
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,189
Right, sir.
- Talk.

585
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,590
The old dancers will not come back

586
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:46,728
so we will need new dancers.

587
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,061
- And sir, there is one...

588
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,232
He has the flag.

589
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,065
We will have to hold an audition
for new dancers.

590
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,337
And for that we will have to
post it to Facebook.

591
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,275
And also make posters.

592
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,404
And, Orkut.

593
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,114
Sir, I know Bhogi.

594
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,080
Mag-

595
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,045
Oh, sorry. I know Bhogi.

596
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,279
He is the best guy for posters.
- I have...

597
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,253
The posters won't be a concern.

598
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,713
You have a lot to say, buddy. Talk.

599
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,016
And, sir...

600
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,420
Yes, talk.
- Talk.

601
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:14,621
Victory to India, sir.

602
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,290
Sir, he's weird like this.

603
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,129
Sorry, sir...

604
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,193
Sorry, sir...

605
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,562
What's up boys?

606
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,104
Suru, sit.

607
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,636
Listen up. I am starting a new team

608
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,975
for the international
hip-hop challenge.

609
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,001
That means a team for India.
Our team!

610
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,645
I have reserved a spot for you guys.

611
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,515
Come on, boys. Let's go.

612
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,516
Yes.

613
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,520
Take him. He anyway loves to cheat.

614
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,556
International !!

615
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,429
Bhogi's poster isn't working.

616
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,333
I don't think anyone
else is going to come.

617
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,735
He's going to drive us nuts.

618
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:03,994
The poster is jinxed.

619
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:04,766
Brothers...

620
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:05,769
- Hey... sorry!

621
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,473
Hey!

622
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,236
- Where do you think you are going?

623
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,575
Is the audition happening here?
- Yes...

624
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,738
And who are you?

625
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,573
From Baroda to Naroda,
I'm very famous.

626
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,743
- Here's another weirdo.

627
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,514
'D' stands for Dharmesh.

628
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,451
Sir. Vishnu sir. l-low are you'?

629
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,012
Alright.

630
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,025
I saw on Facebook that sir is

631
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,618
putting together a new team...

632
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,388
Which is why I am here.

633
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,556
Do you know Vishnu sir?

634
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,791
Of course.

635
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,334
He danced so well in Baroda.

636
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,596
That's when I started dancing.

637
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,035
Show us your moves.

638
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,401
Let me tell you.

639
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,599
My father is in the police force.

640
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,640
He asked me to join the police.

641
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,698
$0, go join!

642
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,711
I don't know anything
else besides dance.

643
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,347
So, I am here. As a patriot.

644
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,711
Hey, patriot.

645
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,648
Will keep talking
or show us your moves?

646
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,345
I will. I am here for that.

647
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,216
Madam.

648
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,256
- She'll come.
- Hurry up.

649
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,313
Come on! Hit it!

650
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,060
Oh! Goggles.

651
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,143
Superb!

652
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,641
Thanks guys.
- It was superb buddy!

653
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,614
What a mind blowing performance.

654
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,585
He is a very good dancer.

655
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:32,679
He will add to the group, sir.

656
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,019
Sir. He is too good.
- Yes, sir!

657
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:36,656
Sir.

658
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,023
Good dancer!
- Thank you, sir.

659
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,495
We need more like him.

660
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,156
Do you need another dancer?

661
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,632
Yes
- I have a fantastic dancer.

662
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,065
I will bring him if you say so.

663
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,161
Yes of course.

664
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,199
Yes.

665
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,535
Sir, am I in the team?

666
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,382
Isn't this a great place, Vinod?

667
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:07,712
What's up, D?

668
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,049
Sir, this is Vinod.

669
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,593
He's the other dancer
that I mentioned.

670
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,559
He's the guy.

671
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,553
Hi, Vinod. lam Vishnu.

672
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:15,756
Sir, he is mute and hearing impaired.
- Hi!

673
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,397
What?

674
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,001
D, what are you saying?

675
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,297
Yes... it's true.

676
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,268
Sir, he is mute and hearing impaired.

677
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,135
In our words,
he doesn't speaker nor a mike.

678
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,368
If he cannot hear...
how will he dance to the beat'?

679
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,273
One chance.

680
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,403
Sorry, but we need a dancer.

681
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,036
All this will not do.

682
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,638
Sir, just watch him once.

683
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,047
He will manage.

684
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,421
Sir, he is saying
that he wants to dance.

685
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,420
I can dance...

686
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,223
...so what if I cannot hear the music.

687
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:49,790
But, sir.

688
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,393
He says that he can...

689
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,632
feel the music.

690
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,106
If you can...

691
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,510
feel the music...

692
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,411
then...

693
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,321
Any Body Can Dance.

694
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,627
- Sir, he's very good.
- We could take him.

695
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,638
- We maybe be in trouble if we take him.
- Boys!

696
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,632
Are you still discussing Vinod?

697
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,699
He dances better than all of us.

698
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:16,376
Yes.

699
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,673
We will have to take him, sir.
What say?

700
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,338
We will have to take him.

701
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,349
Guys! Don't mind but he is
like a live version of a silent film.

702
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,406
He is a film without a soundtrack.

703
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,644
L-low long will we tolerate it'?

704
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,017
Look, it is fine till this point.

705
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,647
If anything gets messed up
in the big competition...

706
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,385
then he will not
take any responsibility.

707
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,152
What will we do then?

708
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,489
Why are you being negative?
- Why are you saying that?

709
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,653
Then who will take responsibility?

710
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:34,457
I Will.

711
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,429
In that case so will I.

712
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:37,193
Me, too.

713
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:37,665
I am in, boss.

714
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:38,597
That's it, Jacky boy.

715
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,191
Sir, give us your final decision.

716
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:41,628
- He is already in.

717
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,432
<i>Yaw.!</i>

718
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,072
five... six... seven... eight.

719
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:49,735
One... two...

720
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,774
three... four...

721
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,342
five... six... seven... eight.

722
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,211
- What were you saying?
- This one...

723
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,514
- Vernon, let's try that step.
- No, this one.

724
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,712
- Is this the one?

725
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,585
Is there place in the team?

726
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,424
There was always place for you guys.

727
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,460
- It's good you guys are back.

728
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,604
Thank you, lord!

729
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,609
Get me the deodorant.

730
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,551
Get him out of here.

731
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,052
What's wrong?
- What a shameless guy!

732
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,118
Well done, boys!

733
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,454
Sir, let's do it once more.

734
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,289
Take rest.

735
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,350
Sir, please...

736
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,259
Hey, Vinnie!

737
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,956
Come on guys...

738
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,029
Once more...
- No more... enough...

739
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,298
- What's wrong with you guys?

740
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:26,699
Sit.

741
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,065
I'm not coming.

742
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,235
L-low much will we practice'?
- Relax.

743
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,006
Come.
Or I'm going to dance on my own.

744
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,672
You go dance with her.

745
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,543
Go on.

746
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,160
Listen, my love

747
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:53,658
Pour the ink of love on me

748
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:03,505
I will take on the colour

749
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:08,115
I will rain on you

750
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:14,587
I am only yours

751
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,128
Your touch makes me come alive

752
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:24,689
Come alive

753
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,351
Superb!
- It's not over yet.

754
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,522
Wait!

755
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,530
I'm not practicing...
- You are going nowhere!

756
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,790
Hold on, D.

757
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,468
Suru, watch this.

758
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,335
I am like sand

759
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,570
You are the source for water

760
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:16,676
You complete me

761
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,518
I am like sand

762
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,752
You are the source for water

763
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:29,293
You complete me

764
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:37,165
I will cross the ocean

765
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,265
With this love of yours

766
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,107
I will blossom

767
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:48,513
I am only yours

768
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,316
Your touch makes me come alive

769
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:57,722
Come alive

770
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,297
Listen, my love

771
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:13,774
Pour the ink of love on me

772
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,744
The Bangalore audition money?

773
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,251
Wait. I will also give you.

774
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,550
Vvhy?

775
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,753
You have my share?
Who gave it to you?

776
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,524
Boyfriend?

777
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,432
Who is my boyfriend?

778
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:46,733
Suru?

779
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,776
Who told you?

780
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:55,649
I am mute and hearing impaired.
lam not blind.

781
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,347
You are seeing a bit too much.

782
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,155
Five... six... seven... eight...

783
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,454
Turn around!

784
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,602
There are just two more days
to the Bangalore Competition.

785
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,035
Come on.

786
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,198
Vinnie, you go!

787
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,470
Strong... hold firm!

788
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,606
Back straight.

789
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,004
Suru, follow me.

790
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,611
Well done, boys!

791
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,156
Keep it strong.
It's becoming loose.

792
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,521
Five... six... seven... eight...

793
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,790
Is this what you are going
to do at the competition?

794
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,665
Make some space for me.

795
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,509
We don't dance this much
in my hometown.

796
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,305
We danced a lot.
Pass the water.

797
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,008
Where's the deodorant?

798
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,389
Why don't you wash your socks?

799
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,263
What happened?

800
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,113
- Hey listen, everyone is waiting.

801
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,244
- Why are you standing alone
and getting sentimental?

802
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,688
- What are you thinking about?

803
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,090
- I'm thinking about
the Bangalore competition.

804
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,685
- Who knows what will happen tomorrow.

805
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:54,258
Once more... once more.

806
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,598
Come on, boys.

807
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,171
The ne><t round, D-Maniacs...

808
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:11,675
Look at them... cheaters!
Wonder who they will copy ne><t.

809
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,684
We just have a small problem.
I'll be back.

810
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,422
Excuse me, guys.

811
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,429
Suresh...

812
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:27,998
Yes?

813
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,731
Mumbai Stunners!
- Yes.

814
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,470
You are quite famous.

815
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,639
Take your group and go back.

816
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,539
You guys are disqualified.

817
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,042
Why are we disqualified, sir?
- Excuse me!

818
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,238
Disqualified?

819
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,471
Even before the performance?
On what grounds?

820
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,606
The organisers can disqualify any team
before their performance.

821
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,050
Yes. But there should be
a valid reason.

822
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,211
Who are you?

823
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:49,655
Vishnu.

824
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,021
Mr. Vishnu...

825
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,084
This is not a reality show for TRPs.

826
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,392
This is a serious,
very serious dance competition.

827
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,600
The audience here has some of
India's best hip-hop dancers...

828
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,659
who do not want to see your team.

829
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,031
The team that wins here
will represent India in Vegas.

830
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,569
And cheaters can't represent India.

831
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:10,508
Sir, we are not cheaters...

832
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,535
We will refund your entry fee.
You guys can leave.

833
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,640
Sir, give us one chance.
Please!

834
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,215
Vishnu sir...
- Please tell them.

835
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:24,189
Nothing's wrong.

836
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:30,185
The team that wins today
will go to Vegas!

837
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,385
The teams that made
it to the finals are...

838
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,328
Desi Tigers, Dancing Parrots,

839
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:36,622
Ulvlaniac...

840
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,088
Red Hustle...

841
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,758
and Frequency.

842
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,264
Now let's get them on stage.

843
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:48,100
Cheaters! Cheaters! Cheaters!

844
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,173
Excuse me. Please.

845
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:54,143
Give us a minute.
Just one minute, please.

846
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,243
I am Vishnu.

847
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,109
I have got a team here from Mumbai.

848
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,119
Whose name is...

849
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,247
- Cheaters!

850
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,088
- Cheaters, go home!

851
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:07,960
Yes.

852
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,256
You were saying this outside as well.

853
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,391
You are right.

854
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,433
I am happy that the audience...

855
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:20,033
sitting here is honest.

856
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,708
Yes, some of the dancers in our team

857
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,272
have cheated earlier.

858
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,374
They must be punished for it.

859
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,676
And they have been.

860
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:31,041
They were disqualified.
Remember?

861
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:37,591
You only saw that
they had copied the steps.

862
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,554
But no one saw...

863
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,623
how brilliant their performance was.

864
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,434
Everyone makes mistakes.

865
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,265
But life is all about...

866
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:53,701
a second chance.

867
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,444
I request you, that if you have ever

868
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:00,447
given yourself a second chance...

869
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,677
please do so with
the Stunners as well.

870
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,384
Because they are
the Indian Stunners...

871
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,148
not M um bai Stunners.

872
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:08,714
My team.

873
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,350
Give them one chance.

874
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:15,328
After that, if you like,
you can show them the door.

875
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,165
But please...

876
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,430
give them a chance.

877
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,731
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

878
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:56,663
But I am stubborn

879
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,172
I will race ahead of my fate
You cannot stop me

880
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,263
Knock me down, I will get up

881
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,606
Break the cage and spread my wings

882
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:05,111
Give it all your might but

883
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:08,342
I will bear it with a smile,
won't bow down my head

884
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,652
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

885
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:25,028
Knock me down, I will get up

886
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:31,162
As much fire as the deserts hold

887
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:35,540
Furious is the blood
In my veins, but still

888
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:40,047
Ashes suffice for the faithful

889
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:44,651
My silence is enough for me.

890
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:49,588
I have been silenced for so long

891
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:54,391
innocently, I have been bearing it.

892
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:59,195
I have been silenced for so long

893
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:04,034
innocently, I have been bearing it.

894
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:13,479
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

895
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:27,494
There are a hundred questions

896
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:32,462
There are a hundred insults

897
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:40,436
My name bears the burden of stains

898
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:44,741
With the ashes
Burnt by a million dreams

899
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,208
These tearless eyes
Bear the last string of hope

900
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,412
We were not given another chance

901
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,081
Or forgiveness

902
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:59,257
l-low much more do we need to suffer'?

903
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:04,060
I have been silenced for so long

904
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,728
innocently, I have been bearing it.

905
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:13,531
I have been silenced for so long

906
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:18,205
innocently, I have been bearing it.

907
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,372
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

908
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,312
But I am stubborn
I will race ahead of my fate

909
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:57,176
You cannot stop me
Knock me down, I will get up

910
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,080
Break the cage and spread my wings

911
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,115
Give it all your might but

912
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:12,694
I will bear it with a smile,
won't bow down my head

913
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,595
Vegas! Vegas!

914
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,807
See what the bill is.

915
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,177
What do you think?

916
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,278
I look like a fool?

917
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:00,578
I am asking them...

918
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,047
whether I look like a fool that...

919
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,641
he is asking for twenty five lakhs?

920
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,014
What should I do?

921
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,254
Anna, are you joking?
I trusted you...

922
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,312
Am I joking? Or are you?

923
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,287
I agree that you are like family.

924
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:14,155
You come and party here with your
friends after you finish your duty.

925
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,992
I have never said anything.
- No... I...

926
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,722
Whenever you have wanted an advance
twenty - fifty thousand...

927
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,466
I have given it to you...
So that you can go have fun.

928
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,500
But today you asked me...

929
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,365
'Uncle Harish,
I want twenty five lakhs!'

930
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,402
Is that a piece of cake?

931
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,264
Anna, you had promised.

932
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,002
In trusting you, I told everyone...

933
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:30,203
Then you should break the promise.
It's that simple.

934
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,107
It's not the word of someone great.

935
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,475
It's waiter Suresh's promise.

936
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,674
Break it with a crack.

937
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,445
Anna, we have worked very hard.

938
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,414
We won in Bangalore.

939
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,282
And even if we come third in Vegas...

940
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,017
I will give back your money
upon my return...

941
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,149
Anna, I promise.

942
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,552
Anna, this is wrong.

943
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,424
I trusted you and told everyone...

944
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:50,726
This word 'trust' is irritating me.

945
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,394
It is firing me up.
What trust?

946
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,628
You've become very sad.

947
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,229
Listen, I will explain to you.

948
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,300
If you are going to
Vegas for this girl...

949
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,002
Don't you say anything about Vinnie...

950
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,477
Listen to me... it's not worth it.

951
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,976
It's better to go
to our local Ivladh Island...

952
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,142
Twenty five hundred will suffice. Yes?

953
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,444
I told you not to talk
about Vinnie like that.

954
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:13,680
Suru, let him be.

955
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,053
Suru, leave him. Come on.

956
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,652
Let it go...

957
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:19,148
Let's go...

958
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,193
You are my own.

959
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,264
Take him away.
- Cheater!

960
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,360
Go home!

961
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:31,727
Going to Vegas?

962
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:35,234
Come.
- Get out of here.

963
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,072
Suru. Let it be.

964
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,076
He has gone mad.

965
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,168
If you don't want to give
the money, then don't.

966
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,611
Don't you talk rubbish about the girl.

967
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,114
Come on, Suru.
I will break apart the entire place.

968
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,513
- I will send you to the police station.
- Call them.

969
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,515
- Stop it! Please.

970
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,643
They will take you.
You can dance there.

971
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,553
Now the money won't come
from there at all.

972
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:52,453
What shall we do?

973
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,550
- It's over.

974
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:54,652
After all this effort...

975
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,355
we've been reduced from
a passport to a ration card.

976
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,296
Don't get started again, Raghav.
- Okay.

977
01:05:58,487 --> 01:05:59,557
Let's go to Vegas.

978
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,067
It is important for me
to go to go to Vegas, too.

979
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,433
But not at the cost of her honour.
- Suru, look...

980
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,027
ls Vegas cancelled?

981
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:05,469
Sorry, sir.

982
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:06,598
Give me an answer...

983
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,143
You said that you would
get the money.

984
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,074
I did.
- Yes?

985
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:10,974
Yes, I did.
- Tell me...

986
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,172
Sir, it is not Suru's fault.

987
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,610
Shetty Anna didn't keep his word...

988
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,512
Sir.
- Sir...

989
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,113
You idiot!

990
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,175
You wasted so much of my time.

991
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,743
Sir, please.

992
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,681
Please, sir.

993
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,155
Sir, sorry. Please, sir.
- I am sorry.

994
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:24,213
Sorry.

995
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,385
It is my fault. Vishnu sir.

996
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:30,019
We have managed only three lakhs
twenty thousand.

997
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,193
Shall I take a loan from aunt Ashima.

998
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,030
Or should I sell my bike.

999
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,433
Hey guys!

1000
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,030
Where do you want to take the ferry
to Vegas from?

1001
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,404
From Versova or from Ivladh?

1002
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,568
What are you saying?

1003
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,542
Why are you upset?
Don't you want to go?

1004
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,672
Cockroach,
where did you get this money?

1005
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,238
Yes. Vishnu sir.

1006
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:49,641
Vishnu sir has given it?

1007
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,547
Vishnu sir hasn't given it.

1008
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:52,677
I took an idea from Vishnu sir...

1009
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:53,686
thought about it and

1010
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,154
took the money from my uncle.

1011
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,622
- Vishnu...

1012
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,020
What is the need to sell this place?

1013
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,724
You sold your land for us?

1014
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,396
Do I need the place for my burial?

1015
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,364
We will win and come back.

1016
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,133
Thank you.

1017
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,568
Suru.

1018
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,733
What did you think?

1019
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,633
That I could not think
because I was angry?

1020
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,573
Guys, get ready for Vegas?

1021
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,476
Yes, sir!

1022
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,489
Yes, it is done.

1023
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,259
The visas are done and

1024
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,064
we have the money
for the ticket as well.

1025
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:17,727
I am coming to America.

1026
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,666
Today is the best day of my life.

1027
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,334
Best. Best. Best. Yes!

1028
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,352
America. Vegas. Happy.

1029
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:37,252
Happy, happy-

1030
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:41,586
Vinod, I have been trying
since eight years.

1031
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,623
It has come true now.

1032
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,097
I will make my dream come true.

1033
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,396
You think Suresh and
Vernon found me?

1034
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,698
I found them.

1035
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,605
Come, sit. I will tell you everything.

1036
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,642
Who will you tell anyway...

1037
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,406
I don't care what you guys do

1038
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,740
once you get to Vegas.

1039
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,208
But I have my plans laid out.

1040
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,314
I was there when Suresh

1041
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:04,707
was planning Vegas.

1042
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,348
I met him.

1043
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,115
Repeatedly.

1044
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,522
I impressed him.

1045
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,987
I impressed all of you

1046
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:15,489
and became your guru.

1047
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,259
And now finally, my plan
is about to take off!

1048
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:21,297
Vegas, I'm on my way!

1049
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,765
- Stop! Stop!

1050
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:05,869
- You, you, you! Step aside.

1051
01:10:17,312 --> 01:10:18,347
Really?

1052
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:19,848
A hip-hop show.

1053
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,987
Is this yours?

1054
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,253
Oh, what do we have here?

1055
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,467
Do you have a prescription
for this, sir?

1056
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:32,797
Hold on.

1057
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:35,671
No prescription. No medicine.

1058
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:36,732
- Sorry.

1059
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,477
Hey...

1060
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,441
I need you guys...

1061
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:47,409
to take off your jackets
and your shoes.

1062
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:48,513
Shoes?

1063
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:49,647
- Yes, shoes.

1064
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:52,489
Shoes.

1065
01:10:53,815 --> 01:10:54,793
Shoes!

1066
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,316
Guys, come on.

1067
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,632
Hi!

1068
01:11:34,856 --> 01:11:36,733
India. .. Indian Stunners.

1069
01:11:36,758 --> 01:11:37,930
Control yourself, Vinnie.

1070
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,773
Alright! Here are your badges...

1071
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:45,273
You guys go straight and left.

1072
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:47,545
Left?

1073
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,584
Boys, there are a lot of teams...

1074
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,283
therefore, we have got a few rooms.

1075
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,985
Of course, there is one for me...

1076
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:01,283
one for Vinnie and

1077
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,456
one for all the boys...

1078
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:20,971
Check that out!

1079
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,480
This is mind blowing!

1080
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:53,803
Sorry sorry sorry...
Will you punish me for it?

1081
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,816
Yes, Vegas!

1082
01:12:57,839 --> 01:12:59,876
Boys, is there a place

1083
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:02,945
like this in the whole world?
- It's fun like none other.

1084
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:05,983
Sir... sir.

1085
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,524
Sir! It's only apple juice.

1086
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,923
Vinnie, go out.

1087
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:11,760
- Sit in the water.

1088
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:12,821
He)', guys.

1089
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:15,801
Juniors and Varsity compete
in the ne><t two days.

1090
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:17,768
There is still some time
for the main event.

1091
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,629
Sir, what will we do for two days?

1092
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:21,765
We will rehearse.

1093
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,503
Be quiet. Are you crazy! No.

1094
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:24,635
Guys, you are in Vegas.

1095
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:27,646
Everyone knows what
an amazing place this is.

1096
01:13:27,702 --> 01:13:29,340
So, whatever you want to do, do it.

1097
01:13:29,404 --> 01:13:32,214
I don't ask you and
you don't ask me where I was.

1098
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,370
You are our God!

1099
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:17,219
This heart has been saved
A hundred times

1100
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:20,329
The heart has escaped
A hundred times

1101
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,926
We forgot the world

1102
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,730
After finding love!

1103
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:31,707
There is me and you, the way
To the heart is through itself

1104
01:14:31,766 --> 01:14:34,770
But this feeling is a little new
Know this!

1105
01:14:35,837 --> 01:14:39,250
There is me and you
Why do you ask, 'What to do?'

1106
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:42,412
The fun starts now
Dance away!

1107
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:47,291
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1108
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,887
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1109
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:54,695
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1110
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:58,465
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1111
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,741
No worries
Dance, my love, dance!

1112
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:05,972
Listen! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1113
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:31,936
Do as I do,

1114
01:15:32,193 --> 01:15:35,902
Then why feel shy?

1115
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:42,740
Forget about the morning
The game is on for tonight

1116
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:46,849
I have seen, I have heard
Deeds of this day

1117
01:15:46,908 --> 01:15:50,378
It is a secret
Know this!

1118
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,422
There is me and you, the way
To the heart is through itself

1119
01:15:54,482 --> 01:15:57,486
But this feeling is a little new
Know this!

1120
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:02,397
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1121
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,904
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1122
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:09,334
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1123
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:13,607
Listen! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1124
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:25,348
Hi,
Are you Indian?

1125
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:27,393
Mobile number?
- Thanks.

1126
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:28,450
I'll call you.

1127
01:16:43,598 --> 01:16:47,512
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1128
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:54,812
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1129
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:58,653
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1130
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:18,199
Five... six... seven... eight...

1131
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,611
You should drink in moderation.

1132
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:26,374
That's enough.

1133
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,320
Come on. Let's practice again.

1134
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:31,152
Chotu, give us the count. Come on...

1135
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:33,351
I've seen many enthusiastic dancers...

1136
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,587
but not one more
enthusiastic than her.

1137
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:35,821
What does she eat?

1138
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:39,289
Don't you guys want to rehearse?
- No...

1139
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,527
Vinnie, we have practiced
nearly fifteen times.

1140
01:17:41,589 --> 01:17:42,624
The boys are very tired.

1141
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,364
Please. And Vishnu sir had said

1142
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:45,837
that we do not have to
rehearse so many times.

1143
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,737
But why are rehearsals a problem?

1144
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,798
Rehearsing too much
could cause injuries.

1145
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,266
Exactly, sir.

1146
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:53,879
The number one reason for injuries

1147
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,813
during competitions, is fatigue.

1148
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,349
In the excitement of
being in a new place...

1149
01:17:57,405 --> 01:17:59,885
you have forgotten
that your body needs rest.

1150
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:01,843
That is why I told you, no rehearsals.

1151
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:03,850
Someone take control of Vinnie!

1152
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:04,822
Got that?

1153
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,455
We had carried so much
money from Mumbai.

1154
01:18:08,516 --> 01:18:09,358
Now, there's barely anything.

1155
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:11,658
If luck was on our side,
it would have doubled.

1156
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:14,860
This is the team's money, idiots!

1157
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,365
Vishnu sir is here.

1158
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:19,234
Sir...

1159
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:20,773
Please keep the money with you.

1160
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,399
The boys are up to a lot of mischief
since yesterday.

1161
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,374
They will spend it all.

1162
01:18:23,431 --> 01:18:24,842
It is your responsibility from now on.
Please...

1163
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:26,207
Come on. Let's go!

1164
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,155
I think we will have to
practice in that area.

1165
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:42,521
Oh! Philippines...

1166
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,791
Boys, Philippine All Stars.

1167
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,568
Let's go meet them.

1168
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,832
Sir, I love you...
I love your dance!

1169
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:11,814
Wait...

1170
01:19:13,948 --> 01:19:15,393
What's wrong with you?

1171
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,728
Suru.

1172
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,290
Guys, what happened?

1173
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:21,826
Okay. Hold it. Guys...

1174
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,767
I am sorry.
- Go.

1175
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:26,631
Yes, I have the money.

1176
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:29,637
They have moved to
the qualifying round.

1177
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:34,210
Such great teams from all over
the world have come here.

1178
01:19:35,236 --> 01:19:37,648
I am worried.
If they don't qualify...

1179
01:19:37,705 --> 01:19:39,707
then along with them...

1180
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,754
even I will have to go back to India.

1181
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:45,486
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1182
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,754
Welcome to Las Vegas, Nevada.

1183
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,721
Ladies and gentlemen,
I also want to thank our friends at...

1184
01:19:52,787 --> 01:19:54,630
Ponds Men's Face Wash.

1185
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,424
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1186
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:57,993
I proudly bring to you...

1187
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:03,604
the Ponds Men's Face Wash
World Starz Hip Hop Challenge.

1188
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,600
The Philippine All Stars!

1189
01:20:36,664 --> 01:20:38,974
Victory to Mother India.

1190
01:20:42,303 --> 01:20:43,611
Viva, Brazil!

1191
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:45,378
Super Hoods!

1192
01:20:47,775 --> 01:20:49,652
That was superb!

1193
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:53,490
Very nice... superb, boys!

1194
01:20:55,917 --> 01:21:00,457
Oh, look at you...
Go home... No qualify!

1195
01:21:00,521 --> 01:21:03,730
What's his problem?

1196
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,960
Come on, boys.

1197
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:08,264
Let's go, boys!

1198
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:14,842
My oh my! Bringing a little curry

1199
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:16,849
in a Hip Hop flavor...

1200
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:21,513
there is also a team from India!

1201
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:21,365
- Can you feel all that energy
in the atmosphere?

1202
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:24,239
The Indian Stunners,
all the way from India...

1203
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:25,800
have entered the contest.

1204
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:31,380
Vishnu sir, we have qualified!
Sir, we made it.

1205
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:34,251
Here we are at the
World Starz Hip Hop Competition

1206
01:23:34,308 --> 01:23:36,515
Here we have the team from India...

1207
01:23:36,577 --> 01:23:37,954
win here for the first time ever.

1208
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,715
It's your first time here ever...

1209
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:42,352
and you have stormed
into the qualifiers.

1210
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,657
L-low does it feel'?

1211
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,525
Yes... yes, we are all very happy.

1212
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,268
We have reached the qualifier round

1213
01:23:49,323 --> 01:23:51,667
for the first time.
- Speak to her in English.

1214
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:52,932
Yes! Yes!

1215
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:53,729
And... first time.

1216
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:54,569
It's history.

1217
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:56,404
In the first attempt, a country

1218
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:57,841
has reached the qualifying round.

1219
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,378
And that's why all the boys

1220
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,277
are happy and even the girl.

1221
01:24:01,335 --> 01:24:02,473
Victory to India.

1222
01:24:02,603 --> 01:24:04,412
There is so much excitement there...

1223
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:05,951
you can feel it. That's great!

1224
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,709
This is our guru, our choreographer.

1225
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:10,518
This is the guru.
Let's ask him - how do you feel'?

1226
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:11,785
What do you want to say?

1227
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,288
I am haPPY-

1228
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:16,326
He is happy.

1229
01:24:31,532 --> 01:24:34,604
Come on...
five... six... seven... eight.

1230
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:36,239
Lift her, hold. Superb!

1231
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:39,647
Very good, guys.
Get her down.

1232
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,915
Super, boys!
Very good Vinnie, Vernon.

1233
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:47,291
Let's do it once more.
- Please, no...

1234
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:48,554
Please.
- One more time.

1235
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,620
You have irritated us by rehearsing
fifty times already.

1236
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,858
The boys are tired, Vinnie...
- Tell her...

1237
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,460
I want to do the lift once more.

1238
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:56,763
Come on, boys.

1239
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:57,961
Come on, boys.

1240
01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,471
Yes. Last one, please.

1241
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:00,403
Suru, last one, please.

1242
01:25:00,461 --> 01:25:01,201
Q Kay-

1243
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:02,564
Boys.

1244
01:25:03,831 --> 01:25:04,571
Ready?

1245
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:07,272
Five... six... seven... go...

1246
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:10,516
Hope... hold.

1247
01:25:11,472 --> 01:25:12,883
Guys, hold her firmly.

1248
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,613
I told you not to practice
so many times.

1249
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:15,619
Didn't I?

1250
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:17,652
She insisted.

1251
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:20,417
Suru...

1252
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:22,558
Go to her.

1253
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,324
What happened? Are you okay?
- Suru...

1254
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,353
Is it hurting?

1255
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:31,927
D...

1256
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:34,439
Call Vishnu sir.

1257
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,601
Tell him that Vinnie is hurt
and to come to the hospital quickly.

1258
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,166
I've run out credits,
can I use your phone?

1259
01:25:38,232 --> 01:25:39,609
Here.
Nevada Hills Hospital.

1260
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:40,839
Hurry UP-

1261
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,406
Vinnie...

1262
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:46,614
Hi, Vinnie.
- Hi!

1263
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,579
Sir, is she okay?

1264
01:25:48,609 --> 01:25:50,589
Yes. Well,
I have checked Vinnie's scan.

1265
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:52,557
She has a stretched deltoid...

1266
01:25:52,613 --> 01:25:54,718
and an out of line femur.

1267
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:57,627
Doctor, has she broken a bone?

1268
01:25:57,952 --> 01:26:00,193
No. No. The bone has not broken.

1269
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:01,592
Thank God!

1270
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:02,828
So can we take her home?

1271
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,427
By all means. But she needs rice...

1272
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,404
Rice. I told you to eat rice.

1273
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:08,496
She was not eating rice.

1274
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:12,272
Sir, she doesn't eat rice,
only flatbreads.

1275
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,970
No. Not that rice.

1276
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:15,339
R-I-C-E.

1277
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,881
Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.

1278
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:19,383
You understand?

1279
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,578
Yes.

1280
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:21,879
Can she dance?

1281
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:22,887
No. I am afraid not.

1282
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,890
She needs rest for at least a week.

1283
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:25,890
One...

1284
01:26:25,913 --> 01:26:27,324
One week!

1285
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:28,826
Q Kay-

1286
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:30,418
Here is her file.

1287
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:31,892
Don't worry, she will be fine.

1288
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:33,530
Don't worry, my dear.
You'll be fine.

1289
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:35,400
Thank you, sir.
- That's okay.

1290
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:39,464
I'm sorry, Suru...

1291
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,564
No need to apologize.
There's nothing wrong with you.

1292
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:43,207
You'll be alright...

1293
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:45,266
It's my fault...

1294
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,210
Vishnu sir told us
not to rehearse so much

1295
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:49,441
and I got over-excited...

1296
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,574
I'm really sorry!

1297
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:51,776
I'm in the centre of our ne><t act...

1298
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:53,443
Now what will we do?

1299
01:26:53,774 --> 01:26:56,653
Listen... don't get worked up... we'll
make some changes in the routine...

1300
01:26:57,411 --> 01:26:59,448
We'll do something...
- Have you lost it?

1301
01:26:59,947 --> 01:27:02,223
We'll lose a lot of time doing this...

1302
01:27:02,683 --> 01:27:05,425
Suru, we'll need to
find a replacement for her.

1303
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:08,228
And how do we do that'?
We are in Vegas!

1304
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:09,896
We need an Indian dancer...

1305
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,795
here and now...
Where will we find someone now?

1306
01:27:11,892 --> 01:27:14,429
We'll get...
- From where?

1307
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:16,535
We will surely...

1308
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,645
Who knew Vernon is this clever...

1309
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:27,145
Vernon, where are you taking us?

1310
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:41,863
Come! Say where pal'?
Tell me how it's gonna be'?

1311
01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:46,302

She has come...

1337
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:16,312
Is she Indian?
- Yes... come on.

1338
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:18,509
Hi, Olive!
- Hi Vernon, hovv are you?

1339
01:31:18,572 --> 01:31:19,915
I'm good.

1340
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:22,580
Hey, sorry to call you so fast...
but you said it was urgent.

1341
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,645
Yes it's urgent...
this is my team.

1342
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:26,316
Hey guys!

1343
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:27,584
- Let me tell her...

1344
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:31,619
He says that you dance very well.

1345
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:33,721
Very well.

1346
01:31:33,787 --> 01:31:35,664
English.
- I have to speak to her in English?

1347
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:37,768
You dance very...

1348
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:40,431
Good.
- Goodly. Good...

1349
01:31:40,494 --> 01:31:41,495
Ah! Thank you very much.

1350
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:42,870
You dance very well, too.

1351
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:44,238
Oh, thank you.

1352
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:46,569
And Vinnie? Where is Vinnie?

1353
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:48,875
You know Vinnie as well?

1354
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:50,745
Come on. Everyone knows you guys.

1355
01:31:50,804 --> 01:31:52,784
You guys are the
Indian Stunners, right?

1356
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,784
I know.

1357
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:54,785
Did you hear that, buddy?

1358
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,584
Yes. But maybe you don't know that
Vinnie has recently injured herself.

1359
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:58,521
What?

1360
01:31:59,813 --> 01:32:01,224
We need your help, Olive.

1361
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,727
So, this is where we kind of rehearse.

1362
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:05,695
Wow! It's huge.

1363
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:07,289
Boys, this is Olive.

1364
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:08,332
We've got the permissions.

1365
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:10,630
And now she's in our team.
Any questions?

1366
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,432
This is Vinnie... That's Jack.

1367
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:14,439
This is Pawan
- l-low are you'?

1368
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:16,270
Everyone say 'hi'!

1369
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,833
This is so bad.
You are hurt so badly.

1370
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:22,673
Guys, this is great!

1371
01:32:22,736 --> 01:32:24,716
What are you saying, Vinnie?
Look at your leg.

1372
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:26,610
Vernon, it is great.

1373
01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:28,312
If she hadn't hurt herself

1374
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:30,480
how would a great dancer
like Olive have joined our group'?

1375
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:31,683
I guess
- Really!

1376
01:32:31,745 --> 01:32:33,281
That's so mean.

1377
01:32:33,347 --> 01:32:34,917
Olive, don't listen to him.

1378
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:36,525
He is talking rubbish.
- Seriously.

1379
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:39,722
Anyway. Where is Vishnu sir?

1380
01:32:57,938 --> 01:32:59,849
I haven't seen him after
the qualifiers. I will look for him.

1381
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:02,513
Vernon, you will have to teach Olive.
You wait.

1382
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,821
Yes. The choreography.
I need to learn this.

1383
01:33:04,878 --> 01:33:07,552
Yes, we will. D, you go.

1384
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:08,423
Raghav, you too.

1385
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:10,325
Tell him we are at rehearsals
and to come quickly.

1386
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:10,953
Go quickly.

1387
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,494
Boys, hurry up.
Raghav, that way.

1388
01:33:30,904 --> 01:33:32,508
Five and six...
- Boys!

1389
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:37,181
Guys, guys, guys.
We are doomed.

1390
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:38,485
Vishnu sir is nowhere to be seen.

1391
01:33:38,545 --> 01:33:39,546
He has even checked out of the hotel.

1392
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:40,489
All the money is also with him.

1393
01:33:40,547 --> 01:33:41,423
What do you mean?

1394
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:42,825
I mean he is a thief.

1395
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:44,521
You took the money
from me to give to him.

1396
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:46,531
I told you, don't trust this man.

1397
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,663
Did you guy check properly
near the bed and...

1398
01:33:48,722 --> 01:33:50,724
He just told you,
he has checked out...

1399
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,236
He is nowhere. There is nothing.

1400
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:53,794
All the money, everything is gone.

1401
01:33:54,361 --> 01:33:55,669
My uncle will kill me.

1402
01:33:55,729 --> 01:33:56,901
He had given the money
with a lot of difficulty.

1403
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,807
The competition is
still to come, Suru.

1404
01:34:00,734 --> 01:34:01,872
Think of something.

1405
01:34:01,935 --> 01:34:04,415
- He took a bag...
He left with the money.

1406
01:34:04,471 --> 01:34:05,882
The entire competition
is still ahead of us.

1407
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:07,350
We have nothing in our pockets.

1408
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:08,648
What will we do now?

1409
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,683
We cannot do anything.
- What should we do?

1410
01:34:11,745 --> 01:34:13,486
Now what? Pick up your bags
and let's go.

1411
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:15,618
Boys...
- Nothing can be done now.

1412
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,687
We are done with the competition.

1413
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,592
Boys...
- What will we do?

1414
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:23,430
Yes, let's go... Let's go.

1415
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:24,662
Hurry up. Pack your bags.
- Suru...

1416
01:34:24,725 --> 01:34:26,864
Vinnie, pack up. Let's go.

1417
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:34,310
Why did you come here? Why?

1418
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:38,810
For the competition.
- "For the competition... competition..."

1419
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:41,843
And why did you come?

1420
01:34:42,309 --> 01:34:43,413
Why did we come, Vernon?

1421
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:47,490
You have been a background dancer
for the last ten years in India.

1422
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,420
And you?

1423
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:54,591
You cannot speak...
why did you come here?

1424
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:55,933
To Vegas... Why'?

1425
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,268
For honour.

1426
01:35:01,795 --> 01:35:03,672
And you, D?
Why did you come here?

1427
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:05,404
You were so popular in Gujarat.

1428
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:07,377
Young kids used to learn from you,
isn't it?

1429
01:35:07,434 --> 01:35:10,472
Why are you teaching kids hip-hop?

1430
01:35:10,537 --> 01:35:11,709
Why are you wasting their time?

1431
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:13,882
Just so that we can show everyone...

1432
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:16,444
back home that we are thieves?

1433
01:35:17,544 --> 01:35:19,683
Previously when we were
the Mumbai Stunners...

1434
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:21,622
They told us that we had copied...

1435
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:24,523
But now we are the Indian Stunners.

1436
01:35:24,818 --> 01:35:27,389
Indian Stunners... We represent India.

1437
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:31,162
If the choreographer leaves if
one person leaves, is the group over?

1438
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:32,903
Is Indian Stunners over?

1439
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:34,762
Let everyone hear it.

1440
01:35:34,828 --> 01:35:36,466
Let them all know too,
the Philippines...

1441
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:38,840
and English team see that
Indians are thieves...

1442
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:40,674
Is that what you want to show?

1443
01:35:42,202 --> 01:35:43,510
Say it. Let me hear it.

1444
01:35:45,472 --> 01:35:46,644
I am here in front of you, right?

1445
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:48,181
Vernon is here, too.

1446
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:51,348
Each one of us is here to dance.

1447
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:52,818
We want to dance.

1448
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,798
We dance to express, not to impress.

1449
01:35:59,853 --> 01:36:01,764
We've not come here for money.

1450
01:36:06,326 --> 01:36:07,430
So just dance.

1451
01:36:07,494 --> 01:36:08,598
Don't worry about the money.

1452
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:10,600
We will deal with everything later.

1453
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:12,541
We came here to dance
and dance, we will.

1454
01:36:12,599 --> 01:36:14,374
Yes.
- Come on, boys.

1455
01:36:17,371 --> 01:36:18,543
Let's take it from the top, Vernon.
- Come on.

1456
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,643
Five... six... seven... eight...

1457
01:36:20,707 --> 01:36:21,947
One and two... three and four...

1458
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:23,347
One and two... three and four...

1459
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,583
Five and six... seven and eight...

1460
01:36:25,646 --> 01:36:27,319
Bring her down carefully.

1461
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:28,856
Very good. Good job!

1462
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:30,486
Very good, Olive!

1463
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:32,292
Superb!
- Vernon, it is good.

1464
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,164
Can you give me some water.

1465
01:36:37,357 --> 01:36:38,802
Vernon, that can be bettered.
- Suru...

1466
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:40,828
Sit here for a minute please.
- What is it?

1467
01:36:44,898 --> 01:36:48,402
I hope you realize that
you have persuaded them again.

1468
01:36:49,269 --> 01:36:50,407
I know.

1469
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:52,613
But if I wouldn't
have said all that...

1470
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:54,613
our team wouldn't have reached here.

1471
01:36:55,275 --> 01:36:58,552
But money is so
important at this point.

1472
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:00,685
If we don't have the money
after the performance...

1473
01:37:00,747 --> 01:37:02,192
what will we do?

1474
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:22,344
Vishnu...

1475
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:29,186
Hi, Swati.

1476
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:36,725
Have a seat.

1477
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,175
Did you come to America
for some work?

1478
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:01,309
Swati, it has taken me
eight years to get here.

1479
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:05,546
You have no idea what all I have gone
through in these eight years, Swati.

1480
01:38:05,879 --> 01:38:08,450
I have only come...

1481
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:11,962
to meet my son Ivlanu.

1482
01:38:15,889 --> 01:38:17,732
What will you accomplish
by meeting Ivlanu now?

1483
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:20,599
- Isn't it a little too late?

1484
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:23,366
I am married now.

1485
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:25,771
Ivlanu has a father

1486
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:28,269
who loves him a lot.

1487
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:32,206
He is a normal man...

1488
01:38:32,472 --> 01:38:33,542
who has a normal job.

1489
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:35,211
He goes to the office.

1490
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:37,322
He has the weekends off

1491
01:38:37,377 --> 01:38:39,789
and takes his family out.

1492
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:41,591
He is a normal guy.

1493
01:38:41,848 --> 01:38:43,259
He looks after us...

1494
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:45,856
He is not a struggling choreographer

1495
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:48,230
who is always on the
lookout for his ne><t job.

1496
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:49,724
You understand?

1497
01:38:57,698 --> 01:39:01,305
Vishnu, relationships
are made and broken.

1498
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,671
I have moved on.

1499
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:07,184
So should you.

1500
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,611
I know... but...

1501
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,517
Our relationship can break.

1502
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:16,288
But not menu's and mine.

1503
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:20,490
You live your life.
Be happy. No problem.

1504
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,861
But please let me meet Ivlanu once.

1505
01:39:27,327 --> 01:39:28,806
I don't think it is a good idea.

1506
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:33,536
I think you should leave now.

1507
01:39:33,967 --> 01:39:34,945
<i>Reese Swain.</i>

1508
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:36,404
I am sorry.

1509
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:38,713
<i>- Hey, mom.</i>

1510
01:40:07,834 --> 01:40:09,609
Hey, you are Vishnu. Aren't you?

1511
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:12,477
Oh, hello, Vishnu sir.

1512
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:13,911
Mom, you know him?

1513
01:40:13,974 --> 01:40:14,816
You know him?

1514
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:16,286
Of course I know him.

1515
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:17,981
He is Vishnu. Vishnu sir.

1516
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:19,519
Where is your phone?

1517
01:40:19,579 --> 01:40:20,853
Yes. Here...

1518
01:40:38,832 --> 01:40:40,209
Hey... This is you, right?

1519
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:43,407
Yes! I knew it.

1520
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,412
Mom...

1521
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:47,718
You like hip-hop?

1522
01:40:47,874 --> 01:40:49,444
Of course. I love hip-hop.

1523
01:40:49,509 --> 01:40:51,819
I even saw your
Bangalore act on YouTube.

1524
01:40:51,978 --> 01:40:53,321
It was fab!

1525
01:40:53,613 --> 01:40:56,651
Mom, do you know that
Vishnu sir's team...

1526
01:40:56,716 --> 01:40:57,990
is the first Indian team...

1527
01:40:58,251 --> 01:41:00,697
that has qualified for the
semi finals in Las Vegas?

1528
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:02,965
Yes, it's been all over.

1529
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:04,861
Can I please have a picture with you?

1530
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:06,529
My friends are gonna burn!

1531
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:07,867
Come.
- Mom, click fast.

1532
01:41:52,839 --> 01:41:53,840
Thank you.

1533
01:41:59,579 --> 01:42:03,254
Ivlanu, Vishnu sir is getting late.

1534
01:42:04,684 --> 01:42:06,493
Thank you, Vishnu sir. Bye.

1535
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:25,744
Mom, you know him?
- Yes, he's an old friend.

1536
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:36,760
Vishnu sir...

1537
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:45,934
India will win, won't it?

1538
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:49,701
India has already won.

1539
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:53,367
Take care.

1540
01:42:58,271 --> 01:43:00,842
Thank you, Gopi,
for helping me out.

1541
01:43:00,907 --> 01:43:02,545
Don't mention it.

1542
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:04,384
You have been waiting to meet Ivlanu
since the last eight years.

1543
01:43:04,911 --> 01:43:05,912
You met him.

1544
01:43:06,446 --> 01:43:07,516
Are you happy now?

1545
01:43:08,748 --> 01:43:09,783
Very!

1546
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:17,265
Vishnu, our team...

1547
01:43:17,857 --> 01:43:18,801
Who is she?

1548
01:43:20,827 --> 01:43:22,807
Looks like there's been a problem.

1549
01:46:06,826 --> 01:46:08,203
Boys, wake up.

1550
01:46:08,828 --> 01:46:11,809
Oh sacred waters!

1551
01:46:12,599 --> 01:46:14,977
You guys will drown in there.
- Raghav, what are you doing?

1552
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:19,649
L-low much fun is this!

1553
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:21,981
What happened?

1554
01:46:23,676 --> 01:46:25,383
Did this happen in the night?

1555
01:46:29,849 --> 01:46:32,659
- There's a hot water spring
that feels like this in Haridvvar...

1556
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:47,874
- We just need some more time.

1557
01:46:47,934 --> 01:46:50,414
No, you got to listen.
You got to get the money together.

1558
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:51,881
But do you know how
they've come from India'?

1559
01:46:51,938 --> 01:46:52,916
I understand that.
-And I am so...

1560
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:54,914
I know all that, but listen...
what I'm trying to tell you

1561
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:56,552
is that it's the rule.

1562
01:46:56,609 --> 01:46:58,714
I got to follow them.
You got to follow them. Okay?

1563
01:46:58,778 --> 01:47:00,587
Look... You have till 12 o'clock

1564
01:47:00,613 --> 01:47:01,387
to get the money.

1565
01:47:01,448 --> 01:47:01,926
If you don't...

1566
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:02,853
you just got to go home.

1567
01:47:02,916 --> 01:47:03,690
Sir, but we just need one chance.

1568
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:04,626
Stop it.

1569
01:47:04,784 --> 01:47:06,525
You just got to pay up or go home.

1570
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:07,428
Okay.
- I'm sorry.

1571
01:47:07,487 --> 01:47:08,761
Okay.
- Sir, please...

1572
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:11,768
What happened?

1573
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:14,237
We need to pay the money.

1574
01:47:14,427 --> 01:47:15,462
NOW!

1575
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:17,840
What did you say?

1576
01:47:17,897 --> 01:47:21,310
"What have we come here to do?
We have come to dance."

1577
01:47:21,835 --> 01:47:23,940
What have we achieved with all this
dancing? We are broke.

1578
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:26,482
Plus, we are in a fix with Vishnu sir.

1579
01:47:26,539 --> 01:47:28,348
We trusted him with the money.

1580
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:29,716
We came here from there...

1581
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:30,777
only to sit like this?

1582
01:47:31,244 --> 01:47:32,245
Here also...

1583
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:36,488
Guys, we are popular.

1584
01:47:37,183 --> 01:47:38,662
People know we dance well.

1585
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:43,462
If we get a couple of days,
we can raise the money.

1586
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:45,300
Right?

1587
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:48,396
That means even after working so hard
we still have to beg?

1588
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:49,471
Beggars? We are not... that.

1589
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:53,534
That's not true... jeez...
Of course you guys are beggars.

1590
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:56,475
That's why you have no
employment problems.

1591
01:47:56,536 --> 01:48:00,177
If you run out of jobs,
there's always begging.

1592
01:48:01,474 --> 01:48:03,283
Suru...
- Suru...

1593
01:48:03,343 --> 01:48:04,481
Listen...
- What?

1594
01:48:04,544 --> 01:48:05,648
Please leave us alone.

1595
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:07,853
I'm requesting you to leave us alone.

1596
01:48:07,914 --> 01:48:10,520
Guys we are here to dance
not to fight.

1597
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:12,688
Don't touch me...
- Don't you touch her...

1598
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:13,730
You want to talk...
talk to me.

1599
01:48:13,786 --> 01:48:16,198
Suru... Suru!
Please...

1600
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,326
Please guys...

1601
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:18,830
Move. Sorry.

1602
01:48:20,193 --> 01:48:20,864
Please.

1603
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:23,673
Sorry.

1604
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:37,611
I was selfish.

1605
01:48:38,878 --> 01:48:40,357
I came here...

1606
01:48:41,748 --> 01:48:43,193
with a vested interest.

1607
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:49,462
For my son Ivlanu.

1608
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:56,203
But because of you,
I not only got my son...

1609
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,233
but also respect.

1610
01:49:00,266 --> 01:49:03,736
Which I could have
never gained by myself.

1611
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:09,410
I can't do anything
about the family that left...

1612
01:49:09,776 --> 01:49:11,278
but the family...

1613
01:49:13,413 --> 01:49:14,756
that we have made now...

1614
01:49:16,215 --> 01:49:18,195
I don't want to lose it.

1615
01:49:20,787 --> 01:49:21,731
Sorry...

1616
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:23,824
Sorry.

1617
01:49:25,792 --> 01:49:28,796
Sir, no. Please don't apologize.

1618
01:49:28,928 --> 01:49:30,464
You are our guru.

1619
01:50:05,398 --> 01:50:07,901
So girls... what's up?

1620
01:50:45,304 --> 01:50:47,648
God, I love Bollywood.
- Bollywood dance? I will teach you...

1621
01:50:47,707 --> 01:50:52,452
Hi, guys. Hi, Indian Stunners.

1622
01:50:53,646 --> 01:50:55,956
Hi, Vishnu sir. I am Pooja.
- Hi!

1623
01:50:56,215 --> 01:50:58,661
A big fan of yours
and Indian Stunners.

1624
01:50:59,585 --> 01:51:00,563
Get up.

1625
01:51:01,921 --> 01:51:03,798
Thank you. Thank you.

1626
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,964
Actually, you don't need to
introduce yourselves...

1627
01:51:07,226 --> 01:51:08,671
I know all of you.

1628
01:51:09,395 --> 01:51:12,569
I have been staying in America
since many years.

1629
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:15,442
I am so happy
to see you guys here.

1630
01:51:15,501 --> 01:51:17,503
I feel so proud to be an Indian.

1631
01:51:18,271 --> 01:51:19,443
Thank you,
- Thank you.

1632
01:51:19,505 --> 01:51:21,985
Actually, I have an Indian restaurant
called Nirvana

1633
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:26,246
and that has the best
Indian food in Vegas.

1634
01:51:26,746 --> 01:51:29,818
I know you guys must be
dying to have Indian food.

1635
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:31,225
Will we get Gujarati snacks there?

1636
01:51:31,284 --> 01:51:32,695
Of course.

1637
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:34,322
So, why don't you come?

1638
01:51:36,589 --> 01:51:37,533
Next time.

1639
01:51:37,724 --> 01:51:39,704
Next time.
- Yes.

1640
01:51:39,759 --> 01:51:43,366
Oh, please let's go.
Come on. Please.

1641
01:51:43,429 --> 01:51:44,464
You like Indian food?

1642
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:45,600
I love Indian...

1643
01:51:46,632 --> 01:51:48,305
Food. She likes Indian food.

1644
01:51:49,502 --> 01:51:50,310
Sir, let's go.

1645
01:51:50,369 --> 01:51:52,246
Please, sir. Let's go. Sir...

1646
01:51:52,305 --> 01:51:55,252
- They might have South Indian food too.
- Come on. There's never a next time.

1647
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:56,787
Alright!
<i>'</i> Yes!

1648
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,914
- Vernon, go on have some chicken.
Pass it here. Looks yummy!

1649
01:51:58,978 --> 01:52:00,548
- Enjoy, it is a party.
- I know.

1650
01:52:12,325 --> 01:52:13,827
Hi D! Hi, guys.

1651
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:14,837
Hello...
- How's it going?

1652
01:52:14,894 --> 01:52:15,736
Hi.

1653
01:52:15,795 --> 01:52:17,001
Hi, Jack!
- Hi!

1654
01:52:18,297 --> 01:52:19,002
Sir...

1655
01:52:19,465 --> 01:52:20,409
Shall I leave?

1656
01:52:22,635 --> 01:52:23,670
Come.

1657
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:25,749
Raghav?

1658
01:52:25,805 --> 01:52:26,943
We are going to be over there.

1659
01:52:27,206 --> 01:52:27,650
You guys sit here...

1660
01:52:27,707 --> 01:52:28,811
- We understand...

1661
01:52:29,709 --> 01:52:30,915
Come.
- Hi!

1662
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:32,889
Hey!

1663
01:52:35,915 --> 01:52:37,189
Hi!
- Hi.

1664
01:52:37,683 --> 01:52:38,593
Do you work out?

1665
01:52:39,619 --> 01:52:40,791
Work out?
- Yes?

1666
01:52:40,853 --> 01:52:42,230
Where is the time?

1667
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:44,735
We rehearse from the morning
until the evening... dancing...

1668
01:52:46,325 --> 01:52:48,430
Okay. Like the saying goes...

1669
01:52:48,494 --> 01:52:52,806
work is worship and
'Pooja' means worship.

1670
01:52:54,467 --> 01:52:55,810
Are you okay?
- Yes.

1671
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:56,939
Yes?
- Dancing...

1672
01:52:56,969 --> 01:52:58,346
Yes...

1673
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:00,443
Excuse me...

1674
01:53:00,506 --> 01:53:02,577
Excuse me, you say you are Indian'?

1675
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:03,549
Yes.

1676
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,480
Is your mother Indian or your father?

1677
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:07,751
Father... why do you ask?

1678
01:53:07,814 --> 01:53:08,815
That is why...

1679
01:53:08,881 --> 01:53:09,882
What do you mean, Suru?

1680
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:12,226
That is why you do
not know how to eat.

1681
01:53:12,451 --> 01:53:15,432
If your mother were Indian,
she would have fed you with her hands.

1682
01:53:15,621 --> 01:53:16,793
You are meant to eat with your hands.

1683
01:53:16,823 --> 01:53:19,235
And the lentils and rice
are to be mixed and eaten.

1684
01:53:19,458 --> 01:53:21,438
You want me to put
my hands in the curry?

1685
01:53:21,494 --> 01:53:23,496
You mean, I actually need to
dip my hands in the curry?

1686
01:53:23,563 --> 01:53:25,634
Yes, put your hands in the curry.

1687
01:53:25,698 --> 01:53:27,473
No, let me show you.

1688
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:28,868
Really.

1689
01:53:29,268 --> 01:53:32,841
If you eat with your hands, you will
be able to make right sized...

1690
01:53:34,841 --> 01:53:37,447
You know...
I mean... what's the word...?

1691
01:53:37,643 --> 01:53:38,621
Bite!

1692
01:53:39,912 --> 01:53:41,391
You are smart. Bite.

1693
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:42,851
No, I am not doing that.

1694
01:53:42,915 --> 01:53:43,655
Take it.
- No. I am sorry.

1695
01:53:43,683 --> 01:53:45,924
Open your mouth. Olive.

1696
01:53:46,185 --> 01:53:46,686
Olive, just try it.

1697
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:48,527
If she doesn't want it,
why are you forcing her?

1698
01:53:48,554 --> 01:53:49,658
I am only feeding her.

1699
01:53:50,223 --> 01:53:51,327
If she doesn't want it,
why are you forcing her?

1700
01:53:51,390 --> 01:53:52,698
I am not forcing her.
She is a friend.

1701
01:53:52,758 --> 01:53:53,600
Suru.

1702
01:53:53,659 --> 01:53:54,535
What Suru?

1703
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:55,932
What will you do?
- What Will I do'?

1704
01:53:56,195 --> 01:53:57,367
What will you do?
- What Will I do'?

1705
01:53:57,396 --> 01:53:58,875
Tell me, what will you do?

1706
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:00,374
She bites!

1707
01:54:00,433 --> 01:54:01,878
She's biting me!

1708
01:54:22,755 --> 01:54:27,670
As the wind touches you
I want to touch it

1709
01:54:27,727 --> 01:54:32,699
I don't wanna go on
And make castles in the sand

1710
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:37,771
If you walk with me
The paths won't be lonely

1711
01:54:37,803 --> 01:54:42,877
I am gonna love you
Like no one ever can...

1712
01:54:43,843 --> 01:54:48,792
l-low long will I be alone'?

1713
01:54:48,848 --> 01:54:53,627
You know I need you by my side!

1714
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:58,869
Yes! l-low long will I live alone'?

1715
01:54:58,925 --> 01:55:02,429
One thing I have realized...

1716
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:04,839
If you hold my hand

1717
01:55:04,897 --> 01:55:07,571
My world will change

1718
01:55:07,633 --> 01:55:09,840
If you hold my hand

1719
01:55:09,902 --> 01:55:12,610
I will have all the joy

1720
01:55:12,672 --> 01:55:14,982
If you hold my hand

1721
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:17,619
My world will blossom

1722
01:55:17,677 --> 01:55:19,679
If you hold my hand

1723
01:55:20,246 --> 01:55:23,591
Oh Baby!
I'll never let you go.

1724
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:28,422
O O O You calling out for me

1725
01:55:28,487 --> 01:55:32,697
O O O You got me on my knees

1726
01:55:32,758 --> 01:55:37,730
If I get you

1727
01:55:37,797 --> 01:55:42,906
I will treat you very dear

1728
01:55:42,935 --> 01:55:47,884
Baby, I'll be there for you forever

1729
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:52,753
I have been saying this
Time and again

1730
01:55:53,713 --> 01:55:58,219
If I get you

1731
01:55:58,284 --> 01:56:02,926
I will treat you very dearly

1732
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:08,204
Baby, I'll be there for you forever

1733
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:12,766
I have been saying this
Time and again

1734
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:19,849
You don't know
l-low I need you

1735
01:56:19,872 --> 01:56:24,321
Like a bird that's looking for the sky

1736
01:56:24,977 --> 01:56:29,824
I know what I am without

1737
01:56:30,282 --> 01:56:33,491
Oh Baby!
I'm just another guy!

1738
01:56:33,552 --> 01:56:35,896
If you hold my hand

1739
01:56:35,921 --> 01:56:38,527
My world will change

1740
01:56:38,591 --> 01:56:40,867
If you hold my hand

1741
01:56:40,926 --> 01:56:43,566
I will have all the joy

1742
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:45,939
If you hold my hand

1743
01:56:46,198 --> 01:56:48,644
My world will blossom

1744
01:56:48,667 --> 01:56:51,204
If you hold my hand

1745
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:54,513
Oh Baby!
I'll never let you go.

1746
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:59,421
O O O You calling out for me

1747
01:56:59,478 --> 01:57:04,484
O O O You got me on my knees

1748
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:09,624
O O O You calling out for me

1749
01:57:09,688 --> 01:57:13,898
O O O You got me on my knees,
for life!

1750
01:57:13,959 --> 01:57:16,496
If you hold my hand

1751
01:57:34,747 --> 01:57:35,919
- What a super hit move.

1752
01:57:40,252 --> 01:57:42,789
- Come closer, let me see.

1753
01:57:43,255 --> 01:57:44,632
- It's really funny.
- Oh my God!

1754
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:46,335
- Raghav has lost it.

1755
01:57:51,197 --> 01:57:52,198
Suru.

1756
01:57:52,331 --> 01:57:53,776
Look at this.

1757
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:54,811
I have shown you twice.

1758
01:57:54,834 --> 01:57:55,869
Two... two minutes.

1759
01:57:56,302 --> 01:57:56,939
One second.

1760
01:57:57,169 --> 01:57:58,273
Come on, Suru.

1761
01:57:58,337 --> 01:57:59,509
What is happening?

1762
01:58:00,306 --> 01:58:01,216
What is happening?

1763
01:58:01,273 --> 01:58:02,911
What are both of you doing?

1764
01:58:03,175 --> 01:58:04,245
Who two?

1765
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:05,850
You and Olive.

1766
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:08,616
Vinnie is feeling bad.
Look at her face.

1767
01:58:08,814 --> 01:58:10,259
Vinnie is feeling bad?

1768
01:58:10,916 --> 01:58:11,860
Vinnie?

1769
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:12,862
Don't do all this.

1770
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:13,886
Where are you taking me?

1771
01:58:13,953 --> 01:58:15,227
Let's clear things right away.

1772
01:58:15,254 --> 01:58:17,700
Vinnie, are you feeling
bad about anything?

1773
01:58:18,858 --> 01:58:19,666
No.

1774
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:20,703
Vernon is saying that...

1775
01:58:22,461 --> 01:58:24,498
You aren't feeling bad about anything?

1776
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:26,542
No.

1777
01:58:28,134 --> 01:58:30,341
When she feeds him, touches him

1778
01:58:30,402 --> 01:58:32,439
then your face falls.

1779
01:58:32,471 --> 01:58:34,382
Now that he is in front of you,
tell him.

1780
01:58:34,707 --> 01:58:35,583
Tell me, Vinnie.

1781
01:58:35,774 --> 01:58:36,252
Tell him.

1782
01:58:36,308 --> 01:58:37,378
He is just talking rubbish.

1783
01:58:37,443 --> 01:58:38,820
What is wrong with you!

1784
01:58:39,512 --> 01:58:41,583
Listen... you go to Olive.

1785
01:58:41,647 --> 01:58:43,490
I am going to Olive.
- Just a minute. Wait.

1786
01:58:43,649 --> 01:58:44,252
You go.

1787
01:58:44,283 --> 01:58:45,785
- Now I should go?

1788
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:47,459
What are you showing her?

1789
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,261
Wait two minutes. Let me show her.

1790
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:50,763
Who are you showing it to?
- What happened?

1791
01:58:50,823 --> 01:58:52,302
Something personal between them.
I don't know.

1792
01:58:52,491 --> 01:58:53,697
Yes! I am feeling bad...

1793
01:58:54,627 --> 01:58:56,368
that you two are getting close,
unnecessarily.

1794
01:58:56,395 --> 01:58:57,601
Why are you feeding her?

1795
01:58:58,931 --> 01:58:59,875
Feeding her...

1796
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:02,276
We are rehearsing, so there is
bound to be contact.

1797
01:59:02,301 --> 01:59:03,609
Is this how rehearsals are done'?

1798
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:04,875
What are you doing?
Everyone's watching.

1799
01:59:05,371 --> 01:59:06,406
Let them see!

1800
01:59:07,406 --> 01:59:09,545
I am not in love with her.

1801
01:59:09,575 --> 01:59:12,488
Why didn't you tell me if
you have feelings for me?

1802
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:15,492
It is obvious to everyone.

1803
01:59:15,514 --> 01:59:17,391
Even Vinod can see it.
Why can't you?

1804
01:59:17,449 --> 01:59:18,826
No I can't. I'm blind!

1805
01:59:18,851 --> 01:59:20,956
Why don't you tell me?

1806
01:59:21,387 --> 01:59:22,331
Say it.

1807
01:59:22,354 --> 01:59:23,526
Do...

1808
01:59:24,256 --> 01:59:25,633
Do I need to tell you?

1809
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:32,570
Why are you getting worked up?

1810
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:35,739
You...

1811
01:59:37,236 --> 01:59:38,374
You know that...

1812
01:59:46,912 --> 01:59:49,290
You'll make her cry!

1813
01:59:49,348 --> 01:59:50,418
Hey, Suru...

1814
02:00:56,548 --> 02:00:57,492
Hold up!

1815
02:00:57,549 --> 02:01:01,861
For the first time in the history of
the World Starz hip-hop challenge...

1816
02:01:01,887 --> 02:01:03,389
two teams have the same points

1817
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:05,902
but there's only
one spot in the finals.

1818
02:01:06,258 --> 02:01:09,262
This means they will be battling
it out tonight in a dance off.

1819
02:01:09,328 --> 02:01:13,606
This is huge for India as the
Philippine All Stars are their idols.

1820
02:01:16,568 --> 02:01:20,243
So, here we are finally
at the face off in Las Vegas.

1821
02:01:20,306 --> 02:01:22,547
And everybody is asking me
who my favorite is.

1822
02:01:22,608 --> 02:01:24,747
You know what...
both teams are my favourite.

1823
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:27,689
First up, let's see what
the Philippine All Stars got for us.

1824
02:02:43,489 --> 02:02:45,435
That was amazing!

1825
02:02:48,927 --> 02:02:50,497
Come on boys... come on.

1826
02:02:51,296 --> 02:02:52,240
What happened?

1827
02:02:52,631 --> 02:02:54,770
Sir, they are very good.

1828
02:02:55,334 --> 02:02:56,472
Sir... how will we...

1829
02:02:56,702 --> 02:02:58,306
They are like our Gods.

1830
02:02:58,971 --> 02:03:01,383
I mean...
- They are not real Gods.

1831
02:03:01,907 --> 02:03:04,615
Now you dance for the real One.

1832
02:03:05,644 --> 02:03:12,254
You won't dance for them but
only for those, who look out for you.

1833
02:03:12,618 --> 02:03:13,722
Come on, Suru!

1834
02:03:13,919 --> 02:03:15,262
DO it!

1835
02:03:18,223 --> 02:03:24,572
Let's go for it!!

1836
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:38,252
O Supreme Being!
Without you...

1837
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:42,952
O Divinity
I am lost

1838
02:03:43,215 --> 02:03:47,789
O Supreme Being!
Without you...

1839
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:52,633
O Divinity
I am lost

1840
02:03:52,691 --> 02:03:57,401
My dreams started taking shape

1841
02:03:57,463 --> 02:04:02,742
Shattered before it came true

1842
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:13,280
My tasks are incomplete.
Please guide me.

1843
02:04:16,615 --> 02:04:26,229
Hail and salute you

1844
02:04:26,258 --> 02:04:35,906
Hail and salute you

1845
02:05:09,501 --> 02:05:11,879
Supreme Lord
The Lord known by many names

1846
02:05:11,937 --> 02:05:14,918
The one in many forms
Who wears the moon on his forehead

1847
02:05:19,211 --> 02:05:21,589
Supreme Lord
The Lord known by many names

1848
02:05:21,647 --> 02:05:23,888
The one in many forms
Who wears the moon on his forehead

1849
02:05:23,949 --> 02:05:26,395
The creators of the universe
All sing your praises

1850
02:05:26,451 --> 02:05:29,694
Superior Lord, the sky echoes
With the melodies of the percussion

1851
02:05:47,906 --> 02:05:52,582
Oh Lord!
This life is transient

1852
02:05:52,644 --> 02:05:56,717
It burns and melts in an instant

1853
02:05:56,748 --> 02:06:02,255
Oh Lord!
I am like a flickering lamp

1854
02:06:02,321 --> 02:06:06,736
My morale has started dwindling

1855
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:09,530
Hope my steps don't halt

1856
02:06:09,561 --> 02:06:16,843
What will happen if the head
that has never bowed down

1857
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,686
Hail and salute you

1858
02:06:25,744 --> 02:06:30,921
Hail and salute you

1859
02:06:31,183 --> 02:06:35,723
Hail and salute you

1860
02:06:35,787 --> 02:06:40,736
Hail and salute you

1861
02:06:59,311 --> 02:07:03,282
Oh Lord
Hail the enlightened one!

1862
02:07:03,348 --> 02:07:05,624
A potent mantra
I chant this mantra

1863
02:07:05,651 --> 02:07:07,324
I respect your power

1864
02:07:07,386 --> 02:07:11,357
Everything starts with you
And ends with you

1865
02:07:11,423 --> 02:07:15,337
Truth, Life and Virtue
Hail the enlightened one!

1866
02:07:15,394 --> 02:07:17,396
Oh valorous Lord
Brave one

1867
02:07:17,429 --> 02:07:19,306
Nurturer of the helpless

1868
02:07:19,364 --> 02:07:23,335
Remover of hurdles
Creator as well as the destroyer

1869
02:07:23,402 --> 02:07:27,179
Provider of clear vision
The strongest being in the Universe

1870
02:07:27,205 --> 02:07:31,153
A potent mantra
I chant this mantra

1871
02:07:31,176 --> 02:07:34,646
I respect your power

1872
02:07:57,169 --> 02:08:00,446
Hey, we have made it to the finals.

1873
02:08:00,505 --> 02:08:03,714
We made it to the finals!
We won. We won. VVon...

1874
02:08:10,182 --> 02:08:10,717
Hey...

1875
02:08:10,782 --> 02:08:11,453
Come.

1876
02:08:11,516 --> 02:08:14,190
I had gone for two minutes.
They beat me again. Look.

1877
02:08:14,252 --> 02:08:15,754
Look at them. Come on. No.

1878
02:08:19,291 --> 02:08:20,634
What are you doing, D?

1879
02:08:20,892 --> 02:08:21,927
They are hitting me.
What are you doing?

1880
02:08:22,194 --> 02:08:23,264
You know how to slap, don't you'?

1881
02:08:23,762 --> 02:08:25,537
Then why did you wait
to be slapped four times?

1882
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:27,607
Why didn't you hit me back
on the first one? Come.

1883
02:08:34,806 --> 02:08:35,443
Hey!

1884
02:08:41,446 --> 02:08:45,394
Stop. Stop. Calm down.

1885
02:08:45,650 --> 02:08:47,459
What happened?
- He slapped me.

1886
02:08:47,519 --> 02:08:48,395
He did?
- Yes.

1887
02:08:48,453 --> 02:08:50,160
Then hit him back!

1888
02:09:04,169 --> 02:09:07,446
Stop! Stop! Get up!

1889
02:09:07,506 --> 02:09:10,316
Now! Stop... Stop it!

1890
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:13,481
Come on. Separate. Separate.

1891
02:09:13,912 --> 02:09:17,325
Get over there. Stop!
Take your breath.

1892
02:09:17,482 --> 02:09:18,460
Everybody.

1893
02:09:18,717 --> 02:09:21,425
I won't have this violence
in my competition.

1894
02:09:21,486 --> 02:09:22,487
You get it?

1895
02:09:22,554 --> 02:09:25,831
I spent ten years getting this garbage
out of hip-hop.

1896
02:09:26,258 --> 02:09:28,932
We won't go back.
Do you understand?

1897
02:09:29,194 --> 02:09:29,763
Yes.

1898
02:09:29,828 --> 02:09:32,536
Do you understand?
Say, 'yes'.

1899
02:09:32,597 --> 02:09:33,405
Yes.

1900
02:09:34,666 --> 02:09:36,703
Your team! Your team!

1901
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,441
You have one more chance.

1902
02:09:38,503 --> 02:09:41,382
You do it again,
you are out of the competition.

1903
02:09:42,307 --> 02:09:44,309
You boys want to show your muscle?

1904
02:09:44,376 --> 02:09:47,220
You show it out there.
Not here.

1905
02:09:48,246 --> 02:09:50,487
Now get out of here.
- Yes, sir!

1906
02:09:50,549 --> 02:09:53,655
Now, go!
Move!

1907
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:55,823
Boys...

1908
02:09:57,289 --> 02:09:58,563
look our Suresh and Vernon.

1909
02:09:58,623 --> 02:10:00,432
Indian Stunners deserve it better.

1910
02:10:00,492 --> 02:10:03,268
This is their first time
but they did super duper great.

1911
02:10:03,562 --> 02:10:05,974
They deserve this because
I know it is from their heart.

1912
02:10:06,231 --> 02:10:07,710
Suresh?
- They know what they want to do.

1913
02:10:07,766 --> 02:10:11,646
To actually show the love for dance
and hip-hop in the whole wide world.

1914
02:10:11,703 --> 02:10:14,411
It is their first time.
But... respect.

1915
02:10:14,472 --> 02:10:15,712
Indian Stunners!

1916
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:22,956
Victory to India!

1917
02:10:25,884 --> 02:10:27,955
One... two...

1918
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,358
- Guys, hold on.

1919
02:10:29,387 --> 02:10:30,559
Three...

1920
02:10:33,825 --> 02:10:36,305
Jack, come.
- Wait, where are you going?

1921
02:10:37,395 --> 02:10:38,465
Thank you.

1922
02:10:39,431 --> 02:10:40,535
L-low are you doing now'?

1923
02:10:40,599 --> 02:10:42,306
L-low is your foot'?
- Okay.

1924
02:10:42,868 --> 02:10:43,710
Sit.

1925
02:10:44,269 --> 02:10:45,577
It is better than before.

1926
02:10:46,872 --> 02:10:48,818
It is better now. Thanks.

1927
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:51,477
Listen, Vinnie...

1928
02:10:52,878 --> 02:10:54,482
I just didn't know...

1929
02:10:55,714 --> 02:10:59,321
I mean, that you and Suru...

1930
02:10:59,618 --> 02:11:00,688
I mean...

1931
02:11:01,553 --> 02:11:02,998
were childhood friends.

1932
02:11:03,855 --> 02:11:05,892
And I unnecessarily came in between.

1933
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:09,531
I am sorry I got carried away.

1934
02:11:12,264 --> 02:11:13,572
I am the one who should apologize.

1935
02:11:14,266 --> 02:11:15,677
Suru is like that.

1936
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:17,577
Everyone falls in love with him.

1937
02:11:19,371 --> 02:11:20,008
Thanks, Vinnie.

1938
02:11:20,272 --> 02:11:22,343
I just wanted to clear this.

1939
02:11:22,607 --> 02:11:24,587
I was your replacement here.

1940
02:11:24,643 --> 02:11:26,850
And now, when you get okay...

1941
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:29,919
before I go,
I wanted to tell you everything.

1942
02:11:30,282 --> 02:11:31,693
Before you go?

1943
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:33,229
Where are you going to go?

1944
02:11:33,551 --> 02:11:36,293
We have reached here because of you.

1945
02:11:36,554 --> 02:11:39,398
And when we move ahead in
the competition, you will be with us.

1946
02:11:39,691 --> 02:11:41,534
You are a part of Indian Stunners now.

1947
02:11:41,826 --> 02:11:43,931
Yes.
- Yes... Yes!

1948
02:12:16,361 --> 02:12:17,738
From the disgraced copycats...

1949
02:12:17,862 --> 02:12:19,273
to the meek underdogs.

1950
02:12:19,331 --> 02:12:22,778
For the first time India takes part
in such an international arena...

1951
02:12:22,834 --> 02:12:24,541
and is now at the top!

1952
02:12:24,602 --> 02:12:26,309
Making us so proud of them.

1953
02:12:34,546 --> 02:12:36,890
I would always tell him...
that he's a winner!

1954
02:12:36,948 --> 02:12:38,757
Just do it! Move aheadl!

1955
02:12:39,217 --> 02:12:39,854
Look at him now.

1956
02:12:39,918 --> 02:12:42,899
Blessings to Team Indian Stunners.

1957
02:12:52,931 --> 02:12:56,310
They defeated the same team
they had copied from.

1958
02:12:56,368 --> 02:12:59,906
Amazing! They made us proud.
So, Indian Stunners... go for it!

1959
02:12:59,971 --> 02:13:01,382
Well done Indian Stunners...

1960
02:13:01,406 --> 02:13:03,545
All the very best...
make India proud.

1961
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:16,760
We are the youth of Punjab...

1962
02:13:16,988 --> 02:13:20,561
Wherever we live... India or America

1963
02:13:20,625 --> 02:13:24,437
If we dance the l-lip-l-lop
or the Bangra...

1964
02:13:24,496 --> 02:13:28,205
We'll will win every battle!

1965
02:13:42,414 --> 02:13:44,655
We are right in the middle
of the Grand Finale...

1966
02:13:44,716 --> 02:13:47,697
of the World Starz Hip Hop Challenge.

1967
02:13:47,752 --> 02:13:51,894
Let me hear you make some noise!

1968
02:13:51,956 --> 02:13:54,334
Louder!

1969
02:13:54,392 --> 02:13:56,872
Are we ready for the ne><t performance?

1970
02:13:57,695 --> 02:13:58,833

1972
02:14:49,514 --> 02:14:50,754
Defending champions...

1973
02:14:50,815 --> 02:14:53,694
Let me see you...
All the way from Germany!

1974
02:16:48,199 --> 02:16:52,204
No contest is complete
without an underdog story...

1975
02:16:52,537 --> 02:16:53,948
And in this contest...

1976
02:16:54,205 --> 02:16:57,243
I think we got one of the finest
underdog stories we ever had.

1977
02:16:57,775 --> 02:17:02,588
These guys coming up ne><t are
in this contest for the first time!

1978
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:05,786
Putting their country
on the hip hop map!

1979
02:17:06,284 --> 02:17:09,356
First time in the contest
they go through the qualifiers...

1980
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:10,899
Go through the quarters...

1981
02:17:10,955 --> 02:17:15,734
go through the semis where
they had to face their inspiration...

1982
02:17:15,793 --> 02:17:19,297
- The Philippine All Stars in a dance off!
- Let's do this!

1983
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:22,237
- And now... raring to go...

1984
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:23,802
Hey you! Indian Stunners, right?

1985
02:17:23,868 --> 02:17:25,370
Go! Go! Go!

1986
02:17:25,436 --> 02:17:26,471
Come on, boys!

1987
02:17:26,838 --> 02:17:27,748
Come on, Suru!

1988
02:17:27,805 --> 02:17:29,250
Come on, boys!

1989
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:31,220
Come on, everyone!

1990
02:17:32,744 --> 02:17:33,848
What happened?

1991
02:17:40,752 --> 02:17:45,667
Only your name stands for the truth

1992
02:17:51,629 --> 02:17:57,307
Only your name is the truth

1993
02:17:57,368 --> 02:18:01,612
And calls out your name dear Mother!

1994
02:18:02,206 --> 02:18:07,918
You are my identity

1995
02:18:08,179 --> 02:18:11,456
My world, my Mother!

1996
02:18:12,750 --> 02:18:17,790
I will put my life on the line
For you a hundred times

1997
02:18:18,423 --> 02:18:23,372
I will put my life on the line
For you a hundred times

1998
02:18:23,561 --> 02:18:27,566
I can sacrifice anything
for you, Mother!

1999
02:18:30,535 --> 02:18:35,609
Mother, I salute thee!

2000
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:41,317
Mother, I salute thee!

2001
02:18:41,379 --> 02:18:46,419
Mother, I salute thee!

2002
02:18:46,651 --> 02:18:51,896
Mother, I salute thee!

2003
02:19:03,267 --> 02:19:05,269
The biggest moment of my life

2004
02:19:05,336 --> 02:19:07,816
Yes! Just a few steps away

2005
02:19:07,872 --> 02:19:09,613
Yes! I have been waiting for so long

2006
02:19:09,674 --> 02:19:10,744
For this evening

2007
02:19:10,808 --> 02:19:13,516
Now, watch what he will do

2008
02:19:13,578 --> 02:19:16,252
Who bows down to none

2009
02:19:16,314 --> 02:19:19,227
Sit and enjoy

2010
02:19:19,283 --> 02:19:21,729
Even if I walk straight

2011
02:19:21,786 --> 02:19:24,426
I am a sure shot winner

2012
02:19:24,489 --> 02:19:26,935
I am indebted to my motherland

2013
02:19:27,191 --> 02:19:29,797
I will defeat and win over you

2014
02:19:29,861 --> 02:19:32,432
Whatever I have promised

2015
02:19:32,497 --> 02:19:34,977
I am from India

2016
02:19:35,233 --> 02:19:37,770
Hold on tight I am coming
with my might To fight and conquer

2017
02:19:37,802 --> 02:19:40,442
Wherever you have come from,
Whomever you may be

2018
02:19:40,505 --> 02:19:42,985
My conquest will take place right here

2019
02:19:43,241 --> 02:19:48,247
I will put our flag of victory there.

2020
02:20:16,274 --> 02:20:18,754
Whether I win or lose

2021
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:21,484
I will show you

2022
02:20:21,546 --> 02:20:24,254
Mother is my Lord

2023
02:20:24,315 --> 02:20:26,727
There is no other shrine

2024
02:20:26,784 --> 02:20:29,424
I will dance,
I am crazed

2025
02:20:29,487 --> 02:20:32,195
I will dance,
My heart is helpless

2026
02:20:32,256 --> 02:20:34,702
This evening

2027
02:20:34,759 --> 02:20:37,296
My Mother will watch

2028
02:20:37,361 --> 02:20:39,841
Whether I win or lose

2029
02:20:39,897 --> 02:20:42,707
My Mother will be watching

2030
02:20:43,968 --> 02:20:45,606
I have to dance

2031
02:20:46,571 --> 02:20:47,914
I have to dance

2032
02:20:48,272 --> 02:20:49,307
Mother

2033
02:20:49,373 --> 02:20:50,716
I have to dance

2034
02:20:50,775 --> 02:20:54,279
My Mother will be watching

2035
02:20:54,479 --> 02:21:00,361
Saffron like the valour

2036
02:21:00,885 --> 02:21:06,392
Green like tender blossoms

2037
02:21:08,259 --> 02:21:13,504
White like clean intentions

2038
02:21:14,765 --> 02:21:20,010
These three colours are
Dearer than life itself

2039
02:21:21,005 --> 02:21:26,455
These three colours are
Dearer than life itself

2040
02:21:27,512 --> 02:21:32,552
My Mother's colour

2041
02:21:32,617 --> 02:21:34,790
Of every good

2042
02:21:34,852 --> 02:21:37,423
Mother, Mother, Mother

2043
02:21:37,788 --> 02:21:40,598
Colour of your tradition

2044
02:21:40,658 --> 02:21:43,298
Colour of your beloved

2045
02:21:43,361 --> 02:21:48,538
Colour of your victory

2046
02:21:48,599 --> 02:21:51,307
l-low can I repay

2047
02:21:51,369 --> 02:21:53,849
Your debt

2048
02:21:53,905 --> 02:21:58,752
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

2049
02:21:59,343 --> 02:22:04,588
Until my last breath

2050
02:22:04,649 --> 02:22:10,224
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

2051
02:22:10,288 --> 02:22:14,759
Only your name stands for the truth

2052
02:22:19,764 --> 02:22:28,411
Mother, I salute thee!

2053
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:41,659
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2054
02:22:41,852 --> 02:22:47,700
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2055
02:22:49,627 --> 02:22:55,305
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2056
02:22:55,366 --> 02:23:00,543
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2057
02:23:00,838 --> 02:23:06,789
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2058
02:23:17,421 --> 02:23:23,428
O Mother

2059
02:23:28,766 --> 02:23:33,476
O Mother

2060
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:57,656
Only your name stands for the truth

2061
02:25:54,411 --> 02:25:59,520
Let's go for it!!

2062
02:26:48,265 --> 02:26:53,738
Glory of moonlight dreams

2063
02:26:53,804 --> 02:26:59,220
Over thy branches and lordly streams

2064
02:26:59,276 --> 02:27:06,592
Clad in thy blossoming trees

2065
02:27:09,753 --> 02:27:12,461
Laughing low and sweet

2066
02:27:12,523 --> 02:27:18,201
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2067
02:27:18,262 --> 02:27:23,507
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2068
02:27:32,643 --> 02:27:38,616
Victory!

2069
02:27:39,783 --> 02:27:44,254
O Victory to thee!

2070
02:27:48,259 --> 02:27:50,239
Whenever I would hurt
myself as a child...

2071
02:27:50,561 --> 02:27:51,767
my mother would say...

2072
02:27:52,496 --> 02:27:54,203
take your ne><t step carefully.

2073
02:27:55,366 --> 02:27:57,642
You should always focus
on the ne><t step.

2074
02:28:00,504 --> 02:28:02,882
We couldn't win the
competition at Vegas...

2075
02:28:03,707 --> 02:28:05,618
but we definitely learned...

2076
02:28:05,943 --> 02:28:08,253
that every effort made in truth...

2077
02:28:08,612 --> 02:28:10,751
is greater than winning or losing.

2078
02:28:12,516 --> 02:28:14,792
And every step in
the right direction...

2079
02:28:14,852 --> 02:28:16,832
is a goal in itself.

2080
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:20,964
After all...

2081
02:28:21,558 --> 02:28:23,435
life is all about the ne><t step.
