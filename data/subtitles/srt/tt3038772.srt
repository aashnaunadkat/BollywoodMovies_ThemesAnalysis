1
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,666
Ratanlal Bagula.

2
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,335
Sub-inspector.

3
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,043
You're in our custody today.

4
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,409
We're going to question you..

5
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,452
...until you don't
give us answers.

6
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,717
Who was she?

7
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,351
How did you know her?

8
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,758
You don't know that“

9
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,487
...you're a police
officer yourself?

10
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,564
Tell <i>us...</i>

11
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,125
...how it happened?

12
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,537
Who paid you to do this job?

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,606
How were you connected
to that girl?

14
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,341
How were you connected
to that girl?

15
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,320
Sir, this is Satyakam.

16
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,718
Shyam Dada.

17
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,624
JB sir.

18
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,220
How were you connected?

19
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,263
Sir.

20
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,485
Bagula.

21
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,190
I am the head of
this investigation.

22
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,224
Arun Roy.

23
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,428
And my study is..

24
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,467
...you'll be rotting
behind bars for a long time.

25
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,035
Be sure.

26
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,407
I can help you.

27
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,711
<i>H you...</i>

28
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,120
...help me.

29
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,485
<i>Look...</i>

30
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,694
Bagula, I know that the..

31
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:42,557
...person who shook up
the law and country is a girl.

32
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,567
Her name isn't Sigdi.

33
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,069
Her real name is Kaanchi.

34
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,607
I can see confirmation
in your eyes.

35
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,208
Right?

36
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,016
We will catch her, soon.

37
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,090
Be sure of that.

38
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:14,188
Soon she will be behind bars.

39
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,298
And maybe...she'll face
rigorous punishment.

40
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,335
What difference
does it make, sir?

41
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,046
It won't make a difference
to her if you hang her.

42
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,013
She will just smile.

43
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,581
She's a b***h.

44
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,389
Forget it, sir.

45
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,131
<i>Look...</i>

46
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,688
I want to know everything.

47
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,326
I want to know the real story.

48
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,664
A petite girl like her
can't do such a big job.

49
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,103
It's impossible.

50
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,266
What's the truth
behind these facts?

51
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,406
How are you
related to Kaanchi?

52
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,038
We're friends.

53
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,179
Since we were kids.

54
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,187
We studied in the same
village, the same school.

55
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,195
She was junior to me.

56
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,061
Seven years ago
I came to Mumbai.

57
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,304
And she grew up there...

58
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,076
in that village.

59
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,445
Koshampa.

60
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,345
A village for retired
army soldiers in Uttrakhand.

61
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,248
She was the star
of that place.

62
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,480
Kaanchi.

63
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,102
Kaanchi!

64
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,073
How did they get in Kakda
Land without permission?

65
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,236
"The scorching heat,
cooling shade."

66
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,301
"Entire village against
one small girl."

67
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,281
"Wouldn't you want
to know her name?"

68
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,681
"Kaanchi."

69
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,553
"Scorching heat,
cooling shade."

70
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,722
"Entire village versus
one small girl."

71
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,528
"Wouldn't you want
to know her name?"

72
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,201
"Kaanchi."

73
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,463
"Kaanchi."

74
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,418
"You're fragile like glass."

75
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,616
"She's like fire."

76
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,264
"She's a girl
from my country."

77
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:40,262
"Let the world
know...hello, hi."

78
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,633
"She displays all
the seven colors."

79
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,306
"The entire world's
assessed from her heart."

80
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,145
"Kaanchi."

81
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,642
Kaanchi!

82
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,651
Kaanchi!

83
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,584
Kaanchi!

84
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,552
Kaanchi!

85
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,518
Kaanchi!

86
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,284
Kaanchi!

87
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,322
Kaanchi!

88
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,325
Kaanchi!

89
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,602
Kaanchi!

90
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,144
Kaanchi!

91
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,577
You played foul.

92
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,410
Get lost.

93
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,478
Why you..

94
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,577
"Kaanchi."

95
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,323
"Kaanchi."

96
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,399
We've to turn this
Koshampa valley..

97
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,103
“Into JB Koshampa
city in a year.

98
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,645
World class valley.

99
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,716
And anyone who
causes obstructions“

100
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,382
...will be responsible
for his position and life.

101
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,250
Don't you know
who you slapped?

102
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,256
Yes, I know.

103
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,384
He's that scoundrel
inspector Bhagwafis son.

104
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,655
You hurled the trophy
which the MLA presented you.

105
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,287
You're no princess.

106
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,127
What else did you expect?
I was holding the trophy in my hands..

107
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,291
...so that's what
I hurled at him.

108
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,028
You're still arguing with me.

109
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,627
You're a girl still
you abuse people.

110
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,033
What do you expect?

111
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,334
Did you want me to
bow before that rascal?

112
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,535
- Be quiet.
- Don't beat her.

113
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,570
Get her married. Her
in-laws will do the beating.

114
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,774
Get going-

115
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,347
Nirman Singh,
will Kaanchi ever change.

116
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,612
N eve r.

117
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,709
What?

118
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
That Deepu
complained to mother?

119
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,282
Yes. To mother.

120
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,758
And he even cried before her.

121
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,561
Kaanchi. Where are you going?

122
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,567
Please spare some change.

123
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,733
Please spare some change.

124
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,372
Hold it!

125
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,743
Hi-five..

126
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,639
Did you complain to my mother?

127
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,273
Yes, I did. So?

128
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,041
Why you..

129
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,385
Now go complain to her again“

130
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,389
“that I slapped you again.

131
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,659
And this is in advance..

132
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,527
...for the next time
you complain to her.

133
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,533
- You'll get it tomorrow.
- That's okay.

134
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,296
Hail Goddess!

135
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,165
She slapped my son,
now watch“

136
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,107
...how I sc***
her and her family.

137
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,199
Mind your tongue.

138
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,506
Okay, here. See.

139
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,605
You will all have
to mind your tongues.

140
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,379
When Kakda family
comes to Koshampa..

141
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,512
“And exterminates all of you.

142
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,157
Binda has given
Kaanchi an apt name.

143
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,453
'Sigdi' (furnace).

144
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:26,654
Kaanchi's the brave
daughter of my brave son.

145
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:31,098
If you mess with her,
she will roar back.

146
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,331
So do you women want
to burn everything down?

147
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,541
Your father...
died in the Kashmir war.

148
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,373
He left us few pieces of land.

149
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:46,546
Now Khajra, Bhagwat will
trouble us to sell the lands.

150
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,117
We were born in Koshampa..

151
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,620
“And we'll die here.

152
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,421
Your Binda has gone crazy..

153
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,653
...by doing rounds
of the court.

154
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,059
And you..

155
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,824
If you keep picking fights
with government officials“

156
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,998
“won't they make
our life difficult.

157
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,759
Even if we all join hands..

158
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,299
...we still can't
face this storm

159
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,601
Mother,
who are you talking to?

160
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,236
<i>You.</i>

161
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,093
Mother, you're singing
in the wrong tune.

162
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,193
And the words are wrong too.

163
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,764
<i>Mother...</i>

164
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,536
It's been 19 years since..

165
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,737
“I've been hearing
this wrong lullaby.

166
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,514
The words can be wrong,
but the meaning is right.

167
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,285
Can I say something?

168
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,220
If I say sorry
will you forgive me?

169
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,568
Sorry, mother.

170
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,141
Don't cry.

171
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,477
She's crying.

172
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,486
Fine, go on cry.

173
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,054
Wretch“

174
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,759
Only one man
can set you right.

175
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,751
Your Binda.

176
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,455
Let him set himself
right first.

177
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,734
Who does he think he is?

178
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,760
Is he back from
the city or not?

179
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,499
No. He never tells me.

180
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,480
One, two, three, four, five..

181
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,177
One, two, three“

182
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,617
Come on, come on.
Faster. Faster.

183
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,282
<i>Faster.</i>

184
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,289
Yes, sir!

185
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,290
Five, six...

186
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,258
Faster. Faster.

187
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,657
Come on, come on.

188
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,563
Come on

189
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,728
30..

190
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,663
29..

191
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,759
Come on, come on.

192
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,163
28...Z7...Z6...

193
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,710
Come on. Go back to training.

194
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,734
Come on.

195
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,039
Z4.

196
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,379
Your hands are amazing.

197
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,580
Kamla, you haven't
seen my magic yet.

198
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,657
Come on, I'll show you magic.

199
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,714
- Hey..
- Quiet.

200
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,192
She falls down intentionally.
Don't I know?

201
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,490
So that Binda
picks her up and..

202
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,225
...touches her under the
pretext of applying balm.

203
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,528
If you feel jealous then
don't come to my compound?

204
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,795
Learn if you want to,
or else leave.

205
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,435
Fine, I won't come.
Don't try to boss me, wretch.

206
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,029
What did you say?

207
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,472
Scoundrel“

208
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,773
Get going all of you.

209
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,007
No anger.
No anger at all.

210
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,113
Binda has to look
after all the students.

211
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,118
- That wretch“
- No abusing.

212
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,710
Girls don't abuse.

213
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,423
- You don't know that ***
- For my sake.

214
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,717
Fine.

215
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,259
He loves you.

216
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,160
I see. ls this love?

217
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,698
He applied ointment
on her back..

218
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,664
Quiet!

219
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,159
I am quiet.

220
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,062
He's returned tired
and worn out from the city..

221
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,197
“And is already training.

222
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,372
He's also brought gift
for you and your mother.

223
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,372
I don't want any gift.

224
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,141
He didn't even say sorry.

225
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,510
Scoundrel“

226
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,049
Get lost.

227
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,052
Papa, why are you
wasting time on her?

228
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,613
- Because I like her.
- I see.

229
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,283
Give me one reason.

230
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,416
She's untainted, honest.

231
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,085
And second,
she's my martyr friend“

232
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,461
“soldier Surat
Singh's daughter.

233
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,166
She still steps out
wearing his army belt.

234
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,530
With pride.

235
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,194
Is that the only reason?

236
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,670
Yes .

237
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,305
Papa...you're totally great.

238
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,036
Completely.

239
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,356
Have some shame?

240
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,521
- What's shameful in this?
- Return the towel.

241
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,191
First I want to know why
did you stay so long in the city?

242
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,756
I went to see a girl for myself.

243
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,525
Papa said so.

244
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,635
Did you find one?

245
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,535
Her name's Haseena.

246
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,706
Is she more beautiful than me?

247
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,141
Every other girl's
more beautiful than you.

248
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,270
- Lie.
- And one more thing.

249
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,673
I went to see a boy for you.

250
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,648
Your mother asked me to do so.

251
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,774
So did you find one?

252
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,020
You'll be really happy to see him.

253
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,152
Then do one thing.

254
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,184
Come like this to my house.

255
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,521
Hey! Kaanchi.

256
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,386
Kaanchi.

257
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,492
Hey naked, here's your towel.

258
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,294
Cover yourself.

259
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,017
Binda.

260
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,051
Yes, Pa Pa-

261
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,051
Son, are you okay?

262
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,616
Sorry, P3Pa-

263
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,386
I forgot to take the towel.

264
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,428
You forgot to take the towel.

265
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,397
Don't feel shy from me.

266
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,763
Here you go.

267
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,562
Tell me...what's your new plan?

268
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,135
See what I do tomorrow, papa.

269
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,708
I'll take a gorgeous
face along for her.

270
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,241
Let me introduce you.

271
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,375
This is Paddu Pahalwan.

272
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,517
Hailing from the village Surajmukhi.

273
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:01,181
Famous singer,
Basya Maharaj is his father.

274
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:05,962
And harlot Reshma Bai is his mother.

275
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,992
Paddu Pahalwan is
their youngest son.

276
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,499
Actually speaking
his name is Padam Singh.

277
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,029
I really like the boy.

278
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,229
Paddu.

279
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,573
We won't find a rich
boy like him again.

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,640
He's nice, sister.

281
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,147
Take him home once.

282
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,246
Can I say something?

283
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,420
I was looking for a
successful man like him.

284
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,027
I don't want a fair,
handsome looking mouse.

285
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,062
I am ready for the marriage.

286
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,191
Start preparing for the marriage.

287
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,548
Binda, you just lit the furnace.

288
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,442
Go inside and see the
consequences of your charade.

289
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,271
She's Kaanchi.

290
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,678
Glass may shatter, but not Kaanchi.

291
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,049
What do I do with this crazy girl?

292
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,618
You teased her,
now you convince her.

293
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,723
She couldn't take a small joke.

294
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,458
She troubles me all day long.

295
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,265
Kaanchi.

296
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,766
"Ev, Sigdi.

297
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,521
"The goat gazed on the grass."

298
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,057
"The girl got scared."

299
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,524
"Crossed the seven seas."

300
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,529
"And drove everyone insane."

301
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,603
Scared?

302
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,468
Yes .

303
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,305
What would you have
done ifl had died?

304
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,801
Followed you.

305
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,273
Why?

306
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,442
'89' YOUr point?

307
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,052
What?

308
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,483
Should I say it or do it?

309
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,093
Do it.

310
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,471
I almost forgot.

311
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,112
Papa gave me this, it was for you.

312
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,374
I told him to remind me.

313
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,110
I gave the t-shirts,
bags and everything else, but“

314
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,446
“but one should give
this beautiful bracelet“

315
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,077
...to the beautiful girl first.

316
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,053
Get lost. Rascal.

317
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,322
Next time you do
something like this..

318
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,526
...l'll hang you from a rope.

319
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,760
That fatty was right for you.

320
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,700
- You should marry..
- I'm looking for a fatty for you too.

321
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,740
Find me one.

322
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,037
I'll have real fun with a fatty.

323
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,371
This girl has no fear of death.

324
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,046
When it comes to
teach someone a lesson..

325
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,314
...her brain runs
faster than a computer.

326
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,649
One.

327
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,157
Two

328
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,819
Three.

329
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,619
Four.

330
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,360
Now keep stretched.
Everyone stand straight.

331
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,395
Come on.

332
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,164
Brother, Kakda's men
are here to buy our land.

333
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,997
- Good morning, Binda.
- Good morning.

334
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,564
Good morning.

335
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,507
You still have an eye.

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,037
I do, Binda.

337
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,040
There's 2 million, in this bag.

338
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,718
And Kakda sir has sent
it especially for you.

339
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,650
All you need to do is sign.

340
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,523
One sign, chapter close.

341
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,027
You don't get such an opportunity,
try to understand.

342
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,393
- Give it.
- Yes.

343
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,769
- Take a look.
- It's heavy.

344
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,205
Chandu, give it to papa.

345
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,170
<i>O</i> kaY-

346
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,263
Thank you, Khajura. Thank you.

347
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,535
Hold on.

348
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,371
Just one sign.
One sign.

349
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,338
Very good.

350
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,314
Very good.

351
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,783
Very good. Very good.

352
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,421
What are you doing?
This is cheating.

353
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,626
What have you done?

354
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,655
The school needed money, Khajura.

355
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,426
Because I need money
to defend my case against you.

356
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,162
You don't get it, Binda.
This is cheating.

357
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,295
Your bosses are doing the cheating.

358
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,305
They bought the lands of
the soldiers by paying peanuts.

359
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,363
You won't get a sq.ft.

360
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,373
If you play games like this“

361
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,604
“then Kakda sir won't spare you.

362
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,779
Who is Kakda?

363
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,751
Why don't you bring
this weakling before me?

364
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,213
If Jhoomar Babu shakes
hands with Binda..

365
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,314
...his fingers will crack.

366
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,583
Do you want to see his strength?

367
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,157
I'll see his later.

368
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,129
First let's test yours.

369
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,101
Go, go to the court.

370
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,266
Let's see who is Jhoomar Babu Kakda.

371
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,678
Sorry, sir.

372
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,277
Bakula here.

373
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:08,384
Wrong timing but
right information, sir.

374
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,094
Sir, engineer Pandey
turned about to be a ratter.

375
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,254
Yes, sir.

376
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,059
He leaked all the information“

377
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,034
“about the Uttranchal
Project to Davar's CA.

378
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,530
For 100 million.

379
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,767
Yes, sir.

380
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,769
What did he say?

381
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,341
What else.

382
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,673
Kill him.

383
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,549
Koshampa Valley project is a scam.

384
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,518
Mr. Jhumar didn't hesitate“

385
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,319
...to seize the lands
of old retired soldiers.

386
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:45,486
Because he's supported
by politicians.

387
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,220
Beware of him.

388
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,984
Okay, sir.

389
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,987
Yes, I am Neeraj Pandey.

390
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,106

391
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,733
It's your brother.

392
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,479
- Yes, brother.
- As your elder brother“

393
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,573
“I've tried telling
you many times“

394
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,278
...that every job should
be done with a system.

395
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,280
Try to understand.

396
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:50,788
Small mistakes lead to
the destruction of the rich.

397
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:56,027
I had a word with the
Chief Minister of that state.

398
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,628
We'll have to go to Koshampa once.

399
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,993
You will have Koshampa..

political influence.

You look rich,

No. I like it alone.

438
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,506
Listen.

439
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,189
Can you show me the
way to sunset point?

440
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,559
Look, if you help me out...

441
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,494
...it'll be nice.

442
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,628
That's fine.

443
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,194
How do I tell you?

444
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,772
Do one thing.

445
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,540
See this path.

446
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,598
Take this route down.

447
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,507
Up ahead you'll find a dirt road.

448
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,444
Take a right from there.

449
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,379
Next you'll come across a hillock.

450
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,508
Jump on it.

451
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,383
And as soon as cross that“

452
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,387
...you will come across a lake.

453
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,679
After you cross that“

454
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,725
...Narayan Temple is 40 steps ahead.

455
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,460
Look.
You can see it from here.

456
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,757
That's where Sunset Point is.

457
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,756
You'll get there in no time.

458
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,432
Get it?

459
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,662
Interesting.

460
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,668
But I don't understand shortcuts.

461
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,738
You don't get shortcuts?

462
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,536
It's right in the middle.

463
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,777
You'll get there in 2 minutes.

464
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,172
If you could sit in the car..

465
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,307
“And direct me to Sunset point“

466
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,351
...l'll be obliged.

467
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,743
I like painting.

468
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,551

to see Sunset Point.

469
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,519
So please.

470
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,620
Will you help me?

Strange name, right?

476
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,737
Yes, but I am not
like my uncle and papa.

477
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,412
I am different.

478
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,483
You see, I am an artist.

479
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,382
Simple nature lover.

480
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,119
Beautiful Koshampa.

482
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,625
I want to paint it from every angle.

If you show me a beautiful
spot like this every day?

484

I hope I didn't hurt you.

492
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,413

Come, I'll drop you home.

496
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,491

Kaanchi, people's trouble
start with this free note.

505

But I want this to
deposit in the school.

Fine, go around with him.

512

I came here to confess
some of my crimes.

520

Everything my secretary
said is a lie.

521

for power and position.

...then who helped
this country progress?

545

549
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,413
He has the habit of taking blame..

550
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,246
...for the dirty jobs
of the other politicians.

551
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,342
My brother is great.

552
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,582
My brother is great!

553
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,383
Teach your children
to progress this country.

554
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,128
Make money.

555
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,063
Make money in every way.

556
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,292
Greed...

557
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,631
...is nothing bad, it's a good thing.

558
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,003
"Money..."

559
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,698
"What's money?"

560
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,531
"Nothing's like it."

561
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,736
"Like money."

562
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,991
What are you thinking, Jhoomar?

563
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,665
That you're peeling an orange.

564
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,730
Orange?

565
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,036
These days' politics
is like this orange.

566
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,610
Different from the inside“

567
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,669
“and different on the outside.

568
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,151
Here...eat it.

569
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,719
So...what did you learn from me today?

570
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,086
That always tell the people..

571
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,358
“What they want to hear.

572
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,092
Very good.

573
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:10,070
But, Jhoomar,
sometimes you get too loud. Loud.

574
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,731
Brother, I am what I am.

575
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:12,736
This is how I am.

576
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,442
I am not a hypocrite.

577
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,153
Shushant sir liked her simplicity“

578
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,563
“and Kaanchi liked
his humbleness, sir.

579
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,154
We don't know what
anyone wrote or taught us.

580
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,488
- Kaanchi.
- Yes.

581
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,492
Straight.

582
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:09,224
We just know three things.

583
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,497
1.Fear no evil.

584
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,633
2.Do what is right.

585
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,231
And 3. Fight for your right.

586
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,703
Where's the India
that was better than the rest?

587
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,614
Who'll be the leader of the people?

588
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,413
And who will be the
benefactor of India.

589
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,642
We.

590
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,280
All of us.

591
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,180
<i>Me.</i>

592
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,083
Myself.

593
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,524
Me alone.

594
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,553
My strength, my honesty.

595
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,760
- Is it true?
- It is.

596
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,591
- Is it true?
- It is.

597
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,634
Is it true?

598
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,669
I like this man.

599
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,205
He's my best friend. Binda.

600
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,073
And me?

601
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,536
We just met.
Good friend.

602
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,714
But doesn't he talk too much.

603
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,340
Exactly.

604
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,979
I tired of explaining him.

605
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,714
He's such a bore, right?

606
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,652
Tell me...can a single
man change the entire country.

607
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,391
If it's like this, then so be it.

608
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,689
We've to lessen the distance
between the rich and the poor.

609
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,171
Bravo.

610
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,738
I heard that young man
likes some local beauty.

611
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,080
Shall we abduct her?

612
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,114
But that's not right, uncle.

613
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,677
Ia-

614
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,474
I mean..

615
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,185
Say it. You're sc***.

616
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,653
You're in love with her. What?

617
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,026
How do I explain it?

618
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,725
I like meeting her.

619
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,994
The way she talks.
The way she moves.

620
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,164
She's the best gift
of God in Koshampa.

621
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,633
I see, let's do one thing then.

622
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,433
Let's sell Koshampa..

623
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,202
“And bring your 'God's gift' here.

624
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,341
What do you say?

625
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,399
Yes .

626
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,740
I want to make her mine.

627
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,448
So the fever's all time high.

628
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,175
Go ahead, son.

629
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,517
Let the heat off. When you
cool down, you can come to me.

630
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,055
<i>O</i> kaY-

631
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,549
Do you know what brother's
biggest mistake is?

632
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,024
This boy here.

633
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,425
Lover boy.

634
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,129
Come on.

635
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,208
You know, today I am going
to make a painting of you..

636
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,311
...more beautiful than you.

637
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:46,783
Why?

638
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,282
Am I not beautiful?

639
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,153
You are.

640
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,520
But colorless.

641
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,660
There's lack of color in you.

642
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,522
Yes...

643
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,325
...so you are there...
to fill in the colors.

644
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,656
That's right.

645
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,066
That's why you will have to“

646
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,264
...close your eyes
like a divine idol.

647
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,203
Please, come on.

648
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,468
<i>O</i> kaY-

649
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:07,732
Perfect.

650
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,476
You know, I love red color.

651
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,777
And this red color will
look beautiful on your lips.

652
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,547
I hope you didn't mind that.

653
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,652
I want to go home.

654
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,763
- I want to complete my painting“
- I want to go home.

655
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,249
'Why didn't you slap him?'

656
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,581
'You were scared, weren't you?'

657
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,332
Subedar was here last evening.

658
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,298
To ask for Kaanchi's
hand in marriage for Binda.

659
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,100
And he wants to get
them married this month.

660
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,571
When the mango's
falling in your lap..

661
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,134
...then what's the hesitation?

662
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,771
That's what I am saying,
get them married.

663
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,308
Anyway,
they are made for each other.

664
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,443
I don't see anyone else.

665
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,278
Why not ask Binda first?

666
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,280
I'll talk to him.

667
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:40,696
Early morning?

668
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,637
I couldn't sleep.

669
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,037
Why?

670
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:49,372
You know...
my family talk about us.

671
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,178
What?

672
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,613
About our marriage.

673
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,417
Will you marry me?

674
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,358
I am not crazy?

675
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:08,622
Why?

676
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,460
Am I so bad?

677
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,527
Look, Kaanchi.

678
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,592
You're not old enough
to get married, neither am I?

679
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,562
You still need to grow up, mentally.

680
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:20,268
And I've to fight these
devils to save Koshampa.

681
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,109
Our families have
been seeing us together“

682
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,146
...since we were kids so..

683
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,283
Now...will you marry me or not?

684
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,346
No.

685
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,516
WhY Won't you?

686
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,187
I'll tell everyone
that you kissed me.

687
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,230
Get lost, you're crazy.

688
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,390
You're a rascal.

689
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,297
And if you say no now..

690
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,233
...then I'll tell
the entire village“

691
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,704
“that you kissed me.

692
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,435
And you also did what's
forbidden before marriage.

693
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,774
Now...are you scared.

694
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:02,546
If you scream at
the top of your voice..

695
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,610
“And tell everyone
what I did with you..

696
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,990
...still I won't marry you.

697
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,184
Now go, get lost.

698
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:14,994
Fine, don't do it.

699
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,028
Go and die. And I'll die too.

700
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,692
I'll jump to my death.

701
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,164
Rascal, who do you think you are?

702
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,558
Now go tell your family..

703
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,063
“That I did what's
forbidden before marriage.

704
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:54,464
And...they can put this
noose around my neck.

705
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,629
Noose?

706
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,136
Yes .

707
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,040
So why do you talk about dying?

708
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,577
Everyone knows that
I was born for you..

709
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,445
“And I will die for you.

710
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,078
"Beloved."

711
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:12,586
Do I have to say
"Love you" in English?

712
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:25,661
"Stay in my sights."

713
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:35,667
I see. I was born for
you and I will die for you.

714
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,401
Good luck.

715
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:43,210
"My life-my heart."

716
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,319
Shushant, look.

717
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,025
Hello. Kaanchi.

718
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,132
Come on, Seema.

719
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,639
I don't want to talk to this rascal.

720
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,199
He's not Kakda,
they are 'Kekde' (crabs).

721
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:13,977
Sorry my friend.

722
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,284
Kaanchi.

723
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,252
I want to talk to you.

724
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,158
I don't want to talk to you.

725
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,599
Listen to me, Kaanchi.

726
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,363
- Go away.
- Kaanchi.

727
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:10,428
- Where are you going inside?
- Kaanchi.

728
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,971
Kaanchi.

729
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,974
Sir, this is not
your father's house.

730
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,639
This is Kaanchi's house.

731
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:22,608
Sir.

732
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,708
<i>You hawk,“</i>

733
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,986
Leave him.
Leave him, Siddhu.

734
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,563
Go leave.

735
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,006
We're kids of soldiers.

736
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,632
Don't mess with us.

737
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,458
What's his name?

738
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:09,995
Binda.

739
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,292
Binda.

740
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:20,702
Kids of the dishonest
and rich have one problem.

741
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,104
As soon they grow up..

742
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,372
...they think they're
rich and powerful.

743
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:29,716
Bad.

744
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,481
It's very, very bad..

745
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:37,248
“That he loved your girlfriend.

746
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,496
But what to do?

747
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,430
I am a father.

748
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,393
I'll have to support
him in this battle of love.

749
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,196
You're right, sir.

750
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,132
I am right too.

751
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:56,100
And if a war's meant to be,
then so be it, sir.

752
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,440
Do you know what war means?

753
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,039
What nonsense.

754
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,049
Sir, even I've read history.

755
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,982
And anyway,
the girl's issue is a short story.

756
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,258
The real issue is Koshampa.

757
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,317
The government has already passed
verdict on Koshampa. What else?

758
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,521
You're the one who
controls the government.

759
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,723
You, you and you.

760
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:20,228
I am really pleased to meet you.

761
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:25,339
Every common man of
India should be like you..

762
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,575
“That was Gandhiji's dream.

763
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,708
Sir, every resident of this
village is exactly like that.

764
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,176
But you can't see
it through those glasses.

765
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,146
That's true.

766
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:41,077
The storm sometimes
doesn't see the lamps.

767
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,525
That's a nice dialogue.

768
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,356
We'll use it in some meeting.

769
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,622
Go, son.

770
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,498
Bless you. Go.

771
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,108
Blessings?

772
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,336
Brother thinks he's Sai Baba.

773
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,706
Blessings?

774
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,303
He just gave blessings
and let him go.

775
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,746
Shoot those bloody ba****.

776
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,541
In all these years you
didn't recognize Dada yet.

777
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,381
He always greets his
enemies affectionately.

778
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,422
Because he never
says what he thinks“

779
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,151
“and never thinks what he says.

780
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,250
I say what I think.

781
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,226
That's why you're not a politician.

782
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,354
You see Dada is far-sighted.

783
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:26,500
And we cannot lose
Koshampa for one Shashank.

784
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,796
Ia-

785
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,570
Brilliant.

786
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,263
Brilliant.

787
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,339
We came here to do business,
rascal..

788
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,540
Not a love-story.
Music please.

789
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,051
Burn me if you can.

790
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,284
I am not worried
about getting burned

791
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,493
In every aspect, in every way..

792
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:56,393
...l am waiting to make you mine.

793
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,691
Only to make you mine.

794
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:04,504
"You're my pain, you're my relief."

795
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:10,501
"You're my companion,
my benefactor."

00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:16,140

"You're my happiness,
you're my tears."

798
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:23,753

"You're my pain, you're my relief."

806
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:18,779
"You're my companion,
my benefactor."

807
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:25,681
"You're my love, you're affection."

808
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:32,291
"You're my happiness,
you're my tears."

809
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:37,654
"You're my happiness,
you're my tears."

810
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,809
One, two, three, four.
Hit, hit, hit.

811
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,135
One, two, three, four.

812

815
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,752
"..dream about you."

816
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:04,287
"My eyes start to glimmer."

817
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:08,327
"Whenever I take your name.."

818
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:13,494
"..my breath turns fragrant."

819
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:21,431
<i>"From head to toe.."</i>

820
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:27,005
"I look completely
in love with you."

821
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:32,644
"I'm no longer me, beloved."

822
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:39,790
"I'm no longer me,
I belong only to you."

"Kaanchi!"

836
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:10,049
Dada says you're the
future of Kakda family.

837
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:15,413
I see no light on your face.

838
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,422
I can see fused bulb, son.

839
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,357
What's the problem, my dear?

840
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,293
He's deeply in love, sir.

841
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,261
But she's getting married to Binda.

842
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,766
So break it off.
What's the problem?

843
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,327
You can commit a number of crimes,
no worries.

844
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:33,135
We're behind you.
Don't worry!

845
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,779
Such a strong boy, going weak.
Shameful.

846
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,116
Where were you?

847
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,745
- To the city.
- Why?

848
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,421
Sherwani (Traditional attire).

849
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,688
Before your marriage?

850
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,425
I am only going to show-off today.

851
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,234
You mean honeymoon before honeymoon.

852
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,004
Pa Pa, YOu ' re great.

853
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,506
I love you.

854
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,404
Show-off.

855
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,645
Give me a new pose.

856
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,537
Honeymoon before honeymoon.

857
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,080
Not allowed.

858
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,549
But Kaanchi always
does what isn't allowed.

859
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,416
That's the fun.

860
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,487
No one knows we're here.

861
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,591
Let's runaway, get married.

862
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,625
That will be great fun, isn't it?

863
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,720
Yes, great fun.

864
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,464
Now give me a pose.

865
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,330
Look, I am going down,
you stay here.

866
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,231
Stay there.

867
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,768
Wow, sweetheart.

868
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,767
Something filmy.

869
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:44,777
A bit to the left.

870
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,014
How am I looking?

871
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,177
Honestly...first time
you're looking so beautiful.

872
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,084
You want to know a truth too.

873
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,215
For the first time
you can see clearly.

874
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,986
- Can I say an old dialogue?
- What?

875
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,996
I love you, Kaanchi.

876
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,197
Always stay like this.

877
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:17,108
Binda.

878
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,177
Binda.

879
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,737
Binda. Binda. Binda.

880
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,309
Binda, look at me.

881
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,045
Binda, look at me.

882
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,177
Get up.

883
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,345
Binda, look at me.

884
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,252
Binda.

885
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,195
Binda.

886
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,514
Fight.

887
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:31,208
Stop.

888
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,500
JB uncle...

889
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,272
...l killed him.

890
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,643
What did you say?

891
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,721
I killed him.

892
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,401
I knew you'll drop a bomb on me.

893
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:34,174
Now do everything systematically.

894
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,071
Get a receipt from Koshampa
Valley Toll-booth“

895
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,545
“showing that all
of you left yesterday.

896
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,208
I will handle the police and media.

897
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,777
- Savita.
- Yes.

898
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,488
What's the name of
the media-manager there?

899
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:49,579
Mr. Gupta.

900
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:53,093
Talk to him,
and you talk to the police.

901
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,357
Yes .

902
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,589
Yes, sir.

903
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,289
It'll be done.

904
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,162
Binda.

905
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,396
Binda!

906
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,567
Can't you hear? I am calling you.

907
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,267
Binda.

908
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,675
Binda!

909
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:59,291
Suraj Chauhan has lost his mind.

910
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,062
I just met all the villagers.

911
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,295
No one has the courage“

912
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:07,493
...to stand against
the law and government.

913
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,534
Everyone's scared...

914
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,503
...of Kakda and his government.

915
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,487
Let's go home, dear.

916
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,357
What happened has happened.

917
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,694
I've serving in the
police force for 40 years.

918
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,332
I've just two words to tell you.

919
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:46,706
Forget everything.

920
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:51,701
We should be used to accepting
injustice as destiny.

921
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:57,107
Powerful people like Kakda
run this country, not us.

922
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,113
We're weak.

923
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,448
And that's how we should be.

924
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,116
We're fools,
and we should remain fools.

925
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,656
Everyone knows about Binda's murder.

926
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:14,701
But in Bhagwafis FIR it's
been termed as an accident.

927
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,502
What can you do?

928
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,763
And what can we do?

929
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,300
Forget it.

930
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:23,301
Forget it.

931
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:03,242
I've written that his
death was an accident.

932
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,253
And this record is proof.

933
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,250
Don't stare at me.

934
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:18,664
If you have the courage,
then fight with the Kakda family.

935
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,277
What are you doing?

936
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,779
Take that and that.

937
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,120
Take that.

938
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,328
Rascal..

939
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,363
Corrupt.

940
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,091
You dare make a false report.

941
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,692
Rascal..

942
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,665
Kaanchi.

943
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,236
Get up rascal.

944
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,137
Kaanchi, what are you doing?

945
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,334
Rascal.

946
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:05,209
She assaulted a government servant.

947
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,215
I will burn this police
station down to ashes.

948
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,308
I will burn you alive here.

949
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:13,115
Let me go.
Who do you think you are?

950
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:15,621
Leave me. Let me go.

951
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,026
Enough!

952
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,487
Who else are you going to kill?

953
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,130
First you destroyed him..

954
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,098
...now you want to
destroy the village.

955
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,327
You want to fight them.

956
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,371
You want to fight the law. No.

957
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,673
I won't let you do what
you're thinking, Kaanchi.

958
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,230
I will.

959
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,306
I will do as I want.

960
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,067
- Kaanchi.
- Move aside.

961
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,637
- For my sake, Kaanchi.
- No oaths.

962
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:45,145
You're used to living like insects,
but not me.

963
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:48,116
You want peace, but not me.

964
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,452
I don't want to live
with you cowards..

965
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,723
- ..Who want to forget the truth.
- Kaanchi.

966
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,195
I won't forget it.

967
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,590
I will die but never forget it.

968
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,657
I won't forget it.

969
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,961
<i>L</i> am going!

970
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,201
Don't try to find me.

971
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:05,967
Kaanchi.

972
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,072
Kaanchi.

973
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,199
Kaanchi stop.

974
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,275
Kaanchi!

975
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,970
Kaanchi!

976
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,684
Kaanchi!

977
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,243
Kaanchi!

978
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,719
Kaanchi, stop!

979
01:06:56,311 --> 01:06:59,155
So Kaanchi...

980
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:01,384
...didn't die.

981
01:07:06,388 --> 01:07:09,528
If she was dead,
would I be sitting here, sir?

982
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:14,070
With the bruises,
the beating, the wounds..

983
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,938
“The heartache.

984
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:24,106
After that Kaanchi
swam across the river..

985
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:25,446
“And reached a village.

986
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,453
From there she travelled
to Katgodam, Dehradoon.

987
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,423
And finally arrived in Mumbai.

988
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,854
Well, I am sorry
to break this news, son.

989
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:11,292
Kaanchi leaped to her
death and committed suicide.

990
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:14,066
It's not good for us.

991
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,377
She kept wandering
around for 12 days“

992
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,385
...on a empty stomach.

993
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,647
Looking for whom?

994
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,114
Me, sir.

995
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,655
She didn't know anyone else here.

996
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,414
- No one.
- Why?

997
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:40,824
We were childhood friends.

998
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:42,293
She was looking for my address.

999
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,225
Sir.

1000
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,398
Yes .

1001
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,594
Do you know Ratanlal Bagula?

1002
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:50,928
Yes, he's our chief.

1003
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:53,405
- Where can I find him?
- Who are you?

1004
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,237
I am from his village.

1005
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,435
Where can I find him?

1006
01:08:56,498 --> 01:09:01,538
Same place where there's theft,
robbery, girls and booze. Where else?

1007
01:09:10,612 --> 01:09:11,920
"Here we go."

1008
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,295
"You're a big boy.."

1009
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:21,430
"You're a big boy, you're sexy."

1010
01:09:21,556 --> 01:09:24,162
"You're like a taxi."

1011
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,201
"Looking here.."

1012
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:28,607
"Aiming there."

1013
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:31,938
"lam a non-stop taxi."

1014
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,571
"I've a carefree big boy."

1015
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,975
"A noose of evil deeds."

1016
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,316
"I'm puffing way amongst beauties.."

1017
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:43,219
"..while completely drunk."

1018
01:09:43,278 --> 01:09:45,884
"I've a carefree big boy."

1019
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:50,590
"Corruption in my heart."

1020
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:52,964
"Seduction in my body."

1021
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,093
"Everyone's tensed about this."

1022
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,968
"But I've just one intention."

1023
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:01,439
"Take a puffmblow away the smoke."

1024
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:03,840
"Keep Mary on your side."

1025
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:06,277
"To hell with Harry."

1026
01:10:06,334 --> 01:10:07,506
"You're a big boy."

1027
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:08,946
"You're a goon."

1028
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:11,348
"But you're a sexy boy."

1029
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:14,114
"You're like a taxi."

1030
01:10:24,519 --> 01:10:26,897
"I don't know what's legal."

1031
01:10:26,955 --> 01:10:29,561
"I don't what my heart says."

1032
01:10:29,624 --> 01:10:31,968
"When the heart's pleased."

1033
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:34,337
"Even illegal is legal."

1034
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:37,001
"Whether I love or hate."

1035
01:10:37,065 --> 01:10:38,408
"What do you care?"

1036
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,048
"Whether I lust or love."

1037
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,515

"Whether I cheat or rob."

01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,119
"What do you care?"

1040
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,125
"Moral or immoral."

1041
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,285
"What do you care?"

1042
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,357
"Get up and go get it, son."

1048
01:11:14,035 --> 01:11:16,447
"..while completely drunk."

1049
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:17,882

01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:35,526
"Seduction in my body."

1056
01:11:36,224 --> 01:11:38,101
"Corruption in my heart."

1057
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,437
"Seduction in my body."

1058
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,336
"I've a carefree big boy."

1059
01:11:42,397 --> 01:11:43,876
"lam notorious."

1060
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,105
"But I am sexy."

1061
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,910
Rascal. It's me Kaanchi.

1062
01:11:57,412 --> 01:11:59,414
So you've come to Mumbai...

1063
01:12:00,348 --> 01:12:01,452
...to try your luck.

1064
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:03,257
To be successful.

1065
01:12:04,252 --> 01:12:05,322
Quickly.

1066
01:12:05,453 --> 01:12:06,523
Short-time.

1067
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:09,893
Great.

1068
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:11,929
Doing great.

1069
01:12:12,894 --> 01:12:15,067
I've been rotting here for 7 years.

1070
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,235
But I am still an
insect in this city.

1071
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,877
Listen to me carefully.
No means no.

1072
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,148
I don't have a place for you.

1073
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:25,008
Fine. I'll leave.

1074
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,052
I'll sleep on the streets.

1075
01:12:28,176 --> 01:12:29,951
Starve to death.

1076
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,019
But I will stay here.

1077
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,184
I'll return home only
when I am successful..

1078
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:35,023
...when I've done something.

1079
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:39,962
Determination.

1080
01:12:41,823 --> 01:12:43,200
I understand...

1081
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:46,300
...what you want to be.

1082
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:49,103
Katrina Ka if.

1083
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:54,946
Come on, I'll make you Katrina Kaif.

1084
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,585
See that?

1085
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:06,483
VT Station.

1086
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:08,086
Keep this.

1087
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,555
3000, keep it.

1088
01:13:11,486 --> 01:13:14,933
Buy a ticket and head back home.

1089
01:13:15,123 --> 01:13:16,397
Get it?

1090
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:18,098
Bye .

1091
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:25,443
Come on India!

1092
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,945
Come on India!

1093
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,413
Come on India!

1094
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,972
Come on India!

1095
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,517
Come on India!

1096
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,143
Come on India!

1097
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,551
Come on India!

1098
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:36,179
Come on India!

1099
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:37,551
Come on India!

1100
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:50,030
Sir, the youth have
started lighting candles“

1101
01:13:50,091 --> 01:13:51,331
...in the day too.

1102
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:52,838
Hail Bajrang“

1103
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,334
Tea.

1104
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,106
Sir, someone from the
inquiry commission's here.

1105
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,341
Can I call you back?

1106
01:14:01,436 --> 01:14:02,847
Jai Hind, sir.

1107
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,383
What are you doing here?

1108
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:08,148
Aren't you ashamed?

1109
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:10,584
You threw a helpless
girl from our village“

1110
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:12,415
“out of our house.

1111
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,017
She's my friend Teji's daughter.

1112
01:14:15,383 --> 01:14:19,092
She's looking for a job,
like you did one day.

1113
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:23,093
Kaanchi will stay here, with me.

1114
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:26,035
Come, Kaanchi.

1115
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:31,404
'I was shocked by her intelligence.'

1116
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,169
'And what do I see next morning?'

1117
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,446
So you convinced mother?

1118
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:46,815
You've grown very smart, Kaanchi.

1119
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:50,358
Now get up, today is a Sunday.

1120
01:14:51,986 --> 01:14:53,465
I want to see Mumbai.

1121
01:14:53,855 --> 01:14:56,301
"You're like a taxi."

1122
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,065
I really am like a taxi.

1123
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,970
You've become really
naughty in Mumbai, Bagula.

1124
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,236
Those who decide to
come and die in Mumbai..

1125
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:05,505
...Mumbai belongs to him.
Get it?

1126
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,041
A city of big people, big stars.

1127
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:11,942
Do you know Kakda?

1128
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,114
Do you know Kakda?

1129
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,588
How do you know him?

1130
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:20,822
They're building a city in Koshampa.

1131
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:24,129
Kakda. Tremendous power.

1132
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,497
I'm one of his important men.

1133
01:15:28,089 --> 01:15:33,368
"Don't forget the childhood love."

1134
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:35,441
You haven't changed.

1135
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,208
Better, Kaanchi.

1136
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:40,944
Much-much better.

1137
01:15:43,204 --> 01:15:44,410
Sigdi.

1138
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,950
My name's Sigdi.

1139
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:50,022
Did you forget?

1140
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,318
My childhood name is Sigdi.

1141
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:54,456
And I like it too.

1142
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,491
Listen, get me a
job with the Kakda's.

1143
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,896
Don't you like me wearing
these good clothes?

1144
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:04,265
Why?

1145
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,565
Impossible.

1146
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,033
My job's still safe,
and that's what matters.

1147
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,370
Drink the cola and watch the sights.

1148
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:19,045
I refused to get her
a job at Shyam Kakda's house.

1149
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,547
Believe me, sir.

1150
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,087
She stood outside Shyam
Kakda's house for 12 days.

1151
01:16:25,146 --> 01:16:27,387
To see who goes in,
and who goes out.

1152
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,470
And she started identifying
every person going in or out.

1153
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:49,938
And you know what she did one day?

1154
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:53,542
She made Shyam Kakda's housekeeper,
Maya, her target.

1155
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,551
Where are you from?

1156
01:17:34,115 --> 01:17:35,287
Uttranchal.

1157
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,023
What do you do?

1158
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,396
I am looking for a job.

1159
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:42,467
Anything, small household chores.

1160
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:47,867
Maya sister, Vidya from
our staff is on a month's leave.

1161
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,374
So appoint her instead.

1162
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:51,171
She looks poor.

1163
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:54,842
I don'tjust look poor, I am.

1164
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,005
What's your name?

1165
01:17:57,972 --> 01:17:59,417
- Sigdi.
- What?

1166
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:00,544
Sigdi.

1167
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,222
Do you know anyone here?

1168
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:04,618
No.

1169
01:18:04,879 --> 01:18:06,483
No one?

1170
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:09,358
Yes. I knowjust one person.

1171
01:18:13,354 --> 01:18:16,528
Dada, <i>C</i> news' report
on the exit polls is..

1172
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:18,502
...that Satyakam
and the youth party..

1173
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,005
...are getting stronger.

1174
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,099
They are the only
obstructions in our polls..

1175
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,906
“And there's nothing
else to worry about.

1176
01:18:30,104 --> 01:18:32,209
Dada, the situation is serious.

1177
01:18:32,273 --> 01:18:33,616
We'll have to do something.

1178
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,947
Bagula, what's the news?

1179
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:41,852
Sir, Satyakam has been
talking rubbish in the media.

1180
01:18:42,116 --> 01:18:43,459
You know him.

1181
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:45,122
He's your friend, isn't he?

1182
01:18:45,186 --> 01:18:46,893
Not actually.

1183
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:49,935
- Vedant.
- Yes.

1184
01:18:50,224 --> 01:18:51,464
Call him.

1185
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:56,306
- And this“
- Hold on.

1186
01:19:00,468 --> 01:19:02,175
Hello, sir, Satyakam speaking.

1187
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,307
Yes, this is Vedant speaking.
On behalf of Shyam sir.

1188
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,148
Why, can't Dada talk to me?

1189
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,983
Look, Satyakam,
just your name's Satyakam“

1190
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,019
“but you're no honest person.

1191
01:19:12,246 --> 01:19:15,284
Brother has served
the country for 50 years.

1192
01:19:16,317 --> 01:19:18,422
No, he's scavenged
the country for 50 years.

1193
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,625
The youth are really angry, sir.

1194
01:19:22,256 --> 01:19:24,862
And they're prepared to uproot you.

1195
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:36,438
Satyakam,
I comply with all your thoughts.

1196
01:19:37,271 --> 01:19:40,081
These discussions are
just an exchange of words.

1197
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:42,948
You move ahead,
we're behind you.

1198
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:45,891
God bless you my son.

1199
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:48,320
He hung up.

1200
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,355
Satya, it's not easy
to expose Shyam Kakda.

1201
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,822
It's not difficult either.

1202
01:19:55,089 --> 01:19:58,036
One day we'll definitely
expose his lie.

1203
01:19:58,226 --> 01:19:59,899
What's this?

1204
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:01,572
Didn't you hear?

1205
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:08,906
I said "You move ahead,
I am...right behind you".

1206
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,543
Tell me Delhi's schedule, Savita.

1207
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:17,555
The media's been favoring
Satyakam because..

1208
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:18,955
“They keep giving them secrets“

1209
01:20:19,013 --> 01:20:20,151
“through RTI or different contacts.

1210
01:20:20,214 --> 01:20:23,024
We'll have to do something.

1211
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,132
Even I shouted slogans
when I was young.

1212
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:27,063
Let them.

1213
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:28,566
They'll calm down eventually.

1214
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:30,330
But what about the media?

1215
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:32,997
The media's job is to shout.

1216
01:20:33,594 --> 01:20:36,336
Event to event, person to person.

1217
01:20:36,397 --> 01:20:38,070
They want to raise TRP.

1218
01:20:38,132 --> 01:20:40,112
When we do an event, our TRP soars.

1219
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:42,170
When they show the event,
their TRP soars.

1220
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:00,895
Bagula. What are
you looking around for?

1221
01:21:00,955 --> 01:21:03,094
I've done your job. Happy?

1222
01:21:03,157 --> 01:21:04,101
HaPPV?

1223
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:06,035
What are you staring at?

1224
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,537
On your reference
I appointed Sigdi“

1225
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:10,166
...in Vidya's place for a month.

1226
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:14,436
Right, right, right.

1227
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,582
- Can I meet her?
- No.

1228
01:21:16,904 --> 01:21:18,440
Is this house?

1229
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,851
Now you've to do
my son Ritesh's job.

1230
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:24,048
Get it?

1231
01:21:34,922 --> 01:21:38,392
Those who come to Mumbai
and decide to die..

1232
01:21:38,459 --> 01:21:40,336
...Mumbai belongs to him.

1233
01:21:42,263 --> 01:21:44,106
Thank you, Bagula.

1234
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:48,841
"Kaanchi."

1235
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:52,509
"Kaanchi."

1236
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:02,255
What did you say her name was?

1237
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:04,489
Sigdi.
Reference, Maya.

1238
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,431
Thank God you're here.

1239
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:11,527
Otherwise I've to do all this alone.

1240
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,130
You don't know...

1241
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:19,269
...the Kakda family
are a big scoundrel..

1242
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:20,539
Who else lives here?

1243
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:23,415
JUSt the senior master.

1244
01:22:24,305 --> 01:22:27,309
Public meetings during day.

1245
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,322
Private meetings at night.

1246
01:22:31,879 --> 01:22:34,120
He has a son too.

1247
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,590
Yes, he does.

1248
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:37,485
Shushant.

1249
01:22:37,985 --> 01:22:42,229
He's insane, completely mad.

1250
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,963
Scoundrel.

1251
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,471
Thank God he's gone
to Dubai for a month.

1252
01:22:46,527 --> 01:22:48,905
They've a big house out there.

1253
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,176
Kaanchi has committed suicide.

1254
01:22:59,173 --> 01:23:03,883
I am sorry, but you were
too obsessed with that girl.

1255
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:07,391
I am sure someone will
definitely come from there.

1256
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:09,328
To destroy you.

1257
01:23:11,018 --> 01:23:11,962
Who?

1258
01:23:12,353 --> 01:23:14,424
Some youngster from Koshampa.

1259
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,338
Shake hands.

1260
01:23:21,996 --> 01:23:23,475
What are you doing?

1261
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:25,139
Shushant.

1262
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,837
I am Kakda, you know that.

1263
01:23:29,136 --> 01:23:30,308
Kakda.

1264
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:32,845
So just chill.

1265
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,164
Who else do you have here?

1266
01:23:45,219 --> 01:23:46,994
I have a brother. Sudhir.

1267
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:51,025
He's a party worker
with Sanjay Pathar.

1268
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:55,540
I had a mother.

1269
01:23:57,031 --> 01:23:59,033
But she passed away last year.

1270
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:02,242
Do you have a mother?

1271
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:05,006
- Yes, I do.
- Where?

1272
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:06,343
In the village.

1273
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:11,253
I really miss my mother.

1274
01:24:12,513 --> 01:24:13,958
Don't you.

1275
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,054
That's how mothers are.

1276
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:22,463
She yells,
beats us, then she cries..

1277
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:26,369
“And then feeds us.

1278
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,377
'For 25 days she
waited for Shushant.'

1279
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,412
'But he didn't come.'

1280
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:16,216
You look sexy in this hairstyle.

1281
01:25:17,478 --> 01:25:21,153
I like the way you
call me sexy, Savita.

1282
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,838
Did you see anything?

1283
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:44,474
Yes .

1284
01:25:44,538 --> 01:25:48,418
Savita was combing your hair.

1285
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:53,186
And you were kissing“

1286
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,091
What you saw...

1287
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:01,059
...you did not see.

1288
01:26:01,522 --> 01:26:06,904
And if you tell anyone what you saw.

1289
01:26:07,561 --> 01:26:12,271
Then you won't be able
to see yourself tomorrow.

1290
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,850
Sweet girl.

1291
01:26:21,909 --> 01:26:23,445
Go.

1292
01:26:25,946 --> 01:26:27,050
Sir.

1293
01:26:27,114 --> 01:26:29,151
Jhoomar sir's call for you.

1294
01:26:30,117 --> 01:26:32,028
Yes, Jhooma r.

1295
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,259
What did you see?

1296
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:45,508
What you saw...you did not see.

1297
01:26:45,566 --> 01:26:47,375
Get that?

1298
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:49,242
Good girl.

1299
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:55,120
"Kaanchi."

1300
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:02,460
There's a powerful failure
outside the bungalow.

1301
01:27:02,516 --> 01:27:04,120
Call Dhanraj.

1302
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:08,867
Where's Sigdi?

1303
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,402
She's gone to call her aunt.

1304
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:11,937
I see.

1305
01:27:17,231 --> 01:27:18,869
The electrician's here.

1306
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,378
We'll have power back on in a while.

1307
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:21,879
Sir's sleeping inside.

1308
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:23,506
Don't disturb him.

1309
01:28:48,055 --> 01:28:50,467
My brother Sanjay called.

1310
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:53,129
He was asking when is Shyam Dada..

1311
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:55,605
“Getting you a MLA ticket?

1312
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,407
I said I don't know.

1313
01:28:57,464 --> 01:29:01,310
I know your aspirations
of becoming a minister.

1314
01:29:01,368 --> 01:29:03,473
I've been with you for 9 years.

1315
01:29:03,537 --> 01:29:06,108
I gave you everything.

1316
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:09,115
That's why I am with you too.

1317
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,218
Forget it.

1318
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:15,624
We should talk about public
matters in a private room.

1319
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:21,227
Make love, with a system.

1320
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:24,961
You and your system.

1321
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:27,301
I love you...Savita.

1322
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:32,870
Siam!

1323
01:29:45,412 --> 01:29:46,982
Call her.

1324
01:29:47,047 --> 01:29:48,287
Yes .

1325
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:56,432
She hung up.

1326
01:30:02,329 --> 01:30:05,936
Mohanlal, open that door.

1327
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:10,381
I hope you remember, tomorrow“

1328
01:30:10,437 --> 01:30:14,886
...is my brother's musical night
at Mustaq lttarwala's bungalow.

1329
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:17,218
You will have to come as my guest.

1330
01:30:17,244 --> 01:30:22,557
Savita, you know.
I've to attend Godrej's Holi party.

1331
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:26,364
You won't go there.

1332
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,236
Is that a threat?

1333
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:35,332
Yes, it is.

1334
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:38,933
If you don't come...

1335
01:30:41,435 --> 01:30:43,506
...then I'll have to request“

1336
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:45,106
“Satyakam to come there.

1337
01:30:52,813 --> 01:30:54,451
<i>Then...</i>

1338
01:30:55,182 --> 01:30:57,253
...you will have to join his party.

1339
01:30:57,384 --> 01:30:59,125
Maybe.

1340
01:30:59,586 --> 01:31:03,363
You'll have to tell him my secrets.

1341
01:31:04,558 --> 01:31:06,435
You said...

1342
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,507
...anything's possible in politics.

1343
01:31:12,032 --> 01:31:13,477
Savita.

1344
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:17,846
You're my confidante.

1345
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:20,474
Yes, I am loyal.

1346
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:24,487
Swiss Banks, millions in scams.

1347
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:28,156
That boy's murder
in Koshampa Valley..

1348
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:30,489
“And your relations with girls.

1349
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:33,589
I've hidden everything
in my heart for all these years.

1350
01:31:33,854 --> 01:31:36,300
And even Sanjay doesn't know this.

1351
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:40,060
For 9 years I've
given you everything.

1352
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:42,205
You must understand.

1353
01:31:42,529 --> 01:31:44,907
My patience is running out.

1354
01:31:57,411 --> 01:31:59,550
- Vedant.
- Yes, Dada.

1355
01:31:59,813 --> 01:32:04,819
You were right,
Savita's running out of patience.

1356
01:32:05,886 --> 01:32:07,957
I was thinking...

1357
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:12,002
...Savita will have
to pass our ordeal.

1358
01:32:14,361 --> 01:32:17,604
We'll have to erase
Savita's name from our list.

1359
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:21,005
But with a system.

1360
01:32:32,846 --> 01:32:34,848
Who's going in sir's room? Check.

1361
01:32:34,915 --> 01:32:37,156
Balbeer, check who's at the back?

1362
01:32:42,322 --> 01:32:44,063
See, someone's there.

1363
01:32:57,471 --> 01:32:59,246

1377
01:33:56,797 --> 01:34:00,870
Brother, I can hear
the danger bells ringing.

1378
01:34:01,235 --> 01:34:04,045
I can see it in my house.

1379
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:13,416
I was looking for Shushant.

1380
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:16,377
Kakda. I will tell you everything.

1381
01:35:16,443 --> 01:35:18,286
Your life's in danger too.

1382

Girls.

As a hostess,
you've to remember three things.

1508
01:42:14,928 --> 01:42:17,238
Smile like an airhostess.

1509
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:21,340
And your body language
should be like a model.

1510
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:23,074
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

1511
01:42:23,136 --> 01:42:25,013
Would you stop that please?

1512
01:42:25,071 --> 01:42:26,914
It's very disturbing.

1513
01:42:27,073 --> 01:42:28,211
Thank you.

1514
01:42:28,274 --> 01:42:31,414
Sir, I've a question.

1515
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:32,582
Go ahead.

1516
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:36,487
If a VIP guest winks at us,
what should we do?

1517
01:42:36,549 --> 01:42:38,222
Good question.

1518
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:40,888
Then you should wink back.

1519
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:44,029
Shouldn't we slap him?

1520
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:47,094
Sigdi, do you know
who you're talking to?

1521
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,106
It's alright.
It's alright.

1522
01:42:49,295 --> 01:42:51,434
Yes. The very handsome JB sir.

1523
01:42:51,564 --> 01:42:52,907
Right.

1524
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:55,379
Well...

1525
01:42:56,403 --> 01:42:57,473
Thank you.

1526
01:42:58,071 --> 01:43:02,042
- Sorry sir if I've offended you.
- No, no, no.

1527
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:06,015
You should always speak
what's in your heart.

1528
01:43:06,146 --> 01:43:08,820
Before you ruin my party.

1529
01:43:08,882 --> 01:43:10,259
You know, I like this.

01:43:57,897 --> 01:43:59,843
“That you want it too.

1541
01:43:59,966 --> 01:44:01,343
Anointment.

1542
01:44:02,068 --> 01:44:04,514
No one anoints the host.

1543
01:44:04,571 --> 01:44:07,484
I did it only because you said so.

1544
01:44:07,874 --> 01:44:10,480
Such a sweet girl.

1545
01:44:12,045 --> 01:44:13,183
Shall we?

1546
01:44:13,246 --> 01:44:14,452
Come on.

1547
01:44:20,453 --> 01:44:22,933
I can see pain on your face.

1548
01:44:23,156 --> 01:44:24,294
Yes, I do.

1549
01:44:24,357 --> 01:44:26,496
From top to bottom.

1550
01:44:26,559 --> 01:44:28,232
Get lost, scoundrel.

1551
01:44:36,369 --> 01:44:37,871

01:44:45,945 --> 01:44:47,219
- Sir, this is for you.
- No.

1556
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,884
Excuse me.

1557
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:51,258
Bagula.

1558
01:44:51,317 --> 01:44:52,421
Sir.

1559
01:44:53,019 --> 01:44:54,965
You go, we'll see.

1560
01:44:55,121 --> 01:44:56,293
Do one thing.

1561
01:44:56,489 --> 01:44:58,162
See that girl in the front.

1562
01:44:58,224 --> 01:44:59,464
That one.

1563
01:44:59,826 --> 01:45:01,430
Give her these chocolates“

1564
01:45:01,494 --> 01:45:03,235
“and tell her I sent them.

1565
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:04,104
Her?

1566
01:45:04,164 --> 01:45:05,302
Go on.

1567
01:45:11,137 --> 01:45:12,582
Where did you get them from?

1568
01:45:13,072 --> 01:45:16,144
Some scoundrel...has sent it.

1569
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:17,381
Take it.

1570
01:45:18,878 --> 01:45:22,223
With this development
we'll need $200 million more..

1571
01:45:22,282 --> 01:45:24,319
...to complete Koshampa project.

1572
01:45:24,384 --> 01:45:26,557
We need that kind of money for.

1573
01:45:26,853 --> 01:45:29,231
And I've given the entire
cash account to Harry Chang.

1574
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:32,270
We just need a
confirmation from you.

1575
01:45:32,358 --> 01:45:33,962
And this way I can show you..

1576
01:45:34,027 --> 01:45:36,598
...nobody can do better than us.

1577
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:53,787
Will you excuse me,
I'd like to go the restroom.

1578
01:45:53,846 --> 01:45:55,189
If you don't mind.

1579
01:45:55,248 --> 01:45:57,228
Please. You sit down
and please watch this.

1580
01:45:57,317 --> 01:45:59,126
Just be back. Excuse me.

Good afternoon.

1584
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:17,570
Don't look at me like
that when I am in a meeting.

1585
01:46:18,137 --> 01:46:21,448
They are important people.
My mind gels diverted.

1586
01:46:22,008 --> 01:46:25,114
But...you waved at me.

1587
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:26,987
So I waved back at you.

1588
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,583
When you wave your hand,
it makes my heart shake.

1589
01:46:29,983 --> 01:46:31,929
Please don't do that.

1590
01:46:32,118 --> 01:46:33,290

I've many things to say to you.

1594
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:41,896
The flowers in the bedroom
upstairs have withered.

1595
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:43,565
Please change them.

1596
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:46,003
And I'm mostly free after 8.

1597
01:46:46,332 --> 01:46:47,572

...l can't find time for myself.

1601
01:47:12,425 --> 01:47:14,405
I have no friends.

1602
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,201
They are all greedy.

1603
01:47:16,262 --> 01:47:18,435
<i>They have their eyes on !B's pocket.</i>

1604
01:47:18,998 --> 01:47:21,000
But you're so rich.

1605
01:47:21,067 --> 01:47:23,172
Yes, that's true.

1606
01:47:23,236 --> 01:47:27,878
But...l've the heart of a kid.

1607
01:47:28,274 --> 01:47:30,982
I'm always looking
for friends like you.

1608
01:47:34,914 --> 01:47:36,257
Yes, Shushant.

1609
01:47:36,516 --> 01:47:38,325
There are lot of discrepancies..

1610
01:47:38,384 --> 01:47:41,456
...in Jacob Taylor and
Harry Chang's cash accounts.

1611
01:47:41,521 --> 01:47:42,591
I've my own doubts.

1612
01:47:42,855 --> 01:47:44,334
Fine, fine, whatever.

1613
01:47:45,325 --> 01:47:47,601
Shushant, my nephew.

1614
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:49,464
He troubles me a lot.

1615
01:47:49,929 --> 01:47:51,567
- When he is coming?
- He's coming.

1616
01:47:51,831 --> 01:47:53,208
He'll come for the party.

1617
01:48:03,576 --> 01:48:05,522

Nattu got killed.

1630
01:48:37,043 --> 01:48:38,113
I know, sir.

1631
01:48:38,177 --> 01:48:39,451

So relax.
Can we go now?

1633
01:48:44,417 --> 01:48:46,192
This is about cash.

1634
01:48:46,252 --> 01:48:48,926
If anything goes wrong,
we'll all be behind bars.

1635
01:48:48,988 --> 01:48:51,127
That rascal Harry
Chang has reported“

1636
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:53,534
...only $43.8 million
instead of $45 million.

1637
01:48:53,593 --> 01:48:56,199
- No, sir.
- Because Rupee rate is falling.

1638
01:48:56,262 --> 01:48:57,832
I don't care if the
Rupee rate is falling.

1639
01:48:57,897 --> 01:49:00,275
I want my money.
I want my full $45 million.

Few people saw him

The girl that ran with Nattu.

1725
01:53:53,492 --> 01:53:55,130
Done, sir.

1726
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:56,162
Bagula, secretly.

1727
01:53:56,228 --> 01:53:57,901
"This is the only night."

1728
01:53:57,963 --> 01:53:59,806
"Shake a leg."

1729
01:53:59,865 --> 01:54:00,935
"This is the only night."

1730
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,173
"Whatever happens is right."

1731
01:54:03,235 --> 01:54:04,942
"This is the only night."

1732
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:07,143
"Shake a leg."

1733
01:54:07,373 --> 01:54:11,583
We need to make
this night special.

1734
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:13,284
Sweet hart.

1735
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:15,515
Can I drink some water?

1736
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:19,827
- Go.
- Be right back.

1737
01:54:20,519 --> 01:54:23,989
Go. Go. Go.

1738
01:55:00,793 --> 01:55:03,171
Love you, Sigdi.

1739
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:32,097
My husband unconscious,
but I am still conscious.

1740
01:55:33,325 --> 01:55:35,066
He's gone mad.

1741
01:55:36,896 --> 01:55:39,809
But youmlittle girl“

1742
01:55:40,032 --> 01:55:42,239
If you value your life, then“

1743
01:55:42,301 --> 01:55:44,781
“get out of this
house in 3 minutes.

1744
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:47,143
And don't even dream
about this man.

1745
01:55:47,339 --> 01:55:50,320
Just save your life and get out.

1746
01:55:50,876 --> 01:55:52,014
Get out!

1747
01:55:59,018 --> 01:56:01,430
God favors the brave.

1748
01:56:03,789 --> 01:56:05,496
Mission JB successful.

1749
01:56:06,926 --> 01:56:10,806
But a bad news was waiting ahead.

1750
01:56:14,066 --> 01:56:16,512
The entire city's under a shock..

1751
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:18,276
...because Shyam Kakda's secretary“

1752
01:56:18,337 --> 01:56:21,181
“Savita Pathare died
in a bomb blast yesterday.

1753
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,151
Who and how this
bomb blast took place..

1754
01:56:23,209 --> 01:56:25,917
...the government has no answer.

1755
01:56:26,111 --> 01:56:28,022
Shyam Kakda's personal
secretary Savita Pathare“

1756
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:31,289
...who was present here
during the incident“

1757
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:32,954
...fell prey to the bomb blast.

1758
01:56:33,018 --> 01:56:35,396
Home Minister's secretary
JB Godbole has stated that..

1759
01:56:35,454 --> 01:56:37,229
...terrorist from the
neighboring country..

1760
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:38,860
...can be behind this bomb blast.

1761
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:40,596
And an enquiry commission
has been appointed.

1762
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,066
This is women killing.

1763
01:56:42,161 --> 01:56:44,038
Sister Savita was very nice woman.

1764
01:56:44,096 --> 01:56:46,576
Savita Pathare was supposed
to get the MLA ticket.

1765
01:56:46,832 --> 01:56:50,211
But unfortunately, she fell
prey along with 4 other people.

1766
01:56:50,269 --> 01:56:52,180
This is Jananta, Zee News.

1767
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:56,448
Savita's death isn't
just a loss to the country“

1768
01:56:56,508 --> 01:56:59,114
“but for me too.

1769
01:56:59,278 --> 01:57:01,417
Savita was the daughter
of this country.

1770
01:57:02,014 --> 01:57:03,357
She was a rising youth.

1771
01:57:03,415 --> 01:57:05,122
She was the future.

1772
01:57:05,517 --> 01:57:08,157
May God give peace
to Savita's soul.

1773
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:09,494
Hello.

1774
01:57:10,155 --> 01:57:11,225
Can I speak to Manjari?

1775
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:14,567
The rival country hasn't
done a good thing“

1776
01:57:14,627 --> 01:57:16,231
...by killing her.

1777
01:57:16,328 --> 01:57:19,901
The enemy should know our strength.

1778
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:25,173
Those rascal terrorists
killed sister Savita.

1779
01:57:25,237 --> 01:57:27,376
That's why I was calling you.

1780
01:57:28,641 --> 01:57:30,643
I lost my phone.

1781
01:57:32,044 --> 01:57:33,022
Lost.

1782
01:57:33,078 --> 01:57:35,217
Hold on.

1783
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:37,188
I found this phone in the garden.

1784
01:57:39,251 --> 01:57:41,026
This is my phone.

1785
01:57:41,954 --> 01:57:43,297
Come on India.

1786
01:57:43,355 --> 01:57:44,857
Come on India.

1787
01:57:44,924 --> 01:57:46,164
Come on India.

1788
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:47,829
Come on India.

1789
01:57:47,893 --> 01:57:49,099
Come on India.

1790
01:57:49,161 --> 01:57:50,265
Come on India.

1791
01:57:50,329 --> 01:57:54,072
Where's that India that
was better than the rest.

1792
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:19,267
We got it.

1793
01:58:19,491 --> 01:58:21,596
Not one, but two.

1794
01:58:23,329 --> 01:58:26,333
We politicians concentrate
more on power..

1795
01:58:26,398 --> 01:58:29,208
“And less on doing our jobs.

1796
01:58:30,002 --> 01:58:34,007
We spend 70% of our
time in party politics.

1797
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:35,643
And do less development.

1798
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:37,319
The real leaders are those“

1799
01:58:37,376 --> 01:58:40,823
...who take the demands
of the poor to the Parliament.

1800
01:58:45,417 --> 01:58:48,455
We'll have to erase
Savita's name from our list.

1801
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:51,194
But with a system.

1802
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:56,304
Terrorists kill innocent
people and leave.

1803
01:58:56,528 --> 01:59:00,908
When girls like Nirbhaya
get raped my heart aches.

1804
01:59:03,135 --> 01:59:06,309
My heart aches seeing
these poor people.

1805
01:59:09,074 --> 01:59:12,078
My heart aches when
I see these kids.

1806
01:59:14,179 --> 01:59:17,490
Protection of women
is my first responsibility.

1807
01:59:25,124 --> 01:59:27,968
What other responsibilities
do you have?

1808
01:59:28,027 --> 01:59:29,938
Do tell us.

1809
01:59:30,095 --> 01:59:32,632
Shyam Kakda!

1810
01:59:50,215 --> 01:59:52,456
Calm down. Everyone calm down.

1811
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:54,964
This is a game of
the opposition party.

1812
01:59:57,589 --> 02:00:02,368
Look...Satyakam's party is..

1813
02:00:04,463 --> 02:00:06,136
I am standing right here.

1814
02:00:06,198 --> 02:00:08,303
And I will stand here.

1815
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:11,572
No one can budge me.

1816
02:00:40,499 --> 02:00:41,944
'You want to fight these people.'

1817
02:00:41,967 --> 02:00:43,412
<i>'The law.'</i>

1818
02:00:53,412 --> 02:00:56,325
Famous Indian Politician
Shyam Kakda's..

1819
02:00:56,381 --> 02:00:59,123
.30 year old reign
has come to an end today.

1820
02:00:59,184 --> 02:01:01,164
The opposition has demanded an..

1821
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:04,167
...attach on all of
Shyam Kakda's property.

1822
02:01:05,057 --> 02:01:06,536
High court has given orders“

1823
02:01:06,592 --> 02:01:09,163
...to keep Shyam Kakda
in judicial custody.

1824
02:01:21,406 --> 02:01:25,149
Sir, I've received a list Mr.
Jhoomar's foreign bank accounts.

1825
02:01:25,344 --> 02:01:26,379
Who gave it to you?

1826
02:01:26,578 --> 02:01:27,852
The 'Jai Yuva Sang'.

1827
02:01:28,046 --> 02:01:29,286
And who gave it to them?

1828
02:01:29,515 --> 02:01:31,461
They don't want to say it.

1829
02:01:43,795 --> 02:01:45,536
- Good morning, sir.
- Yes.

1830
02:01:45,898 --> 02:01:47,571
Nishikant from CBI.

1831
02:01:47,966 --> 02:01:49,274
So what do I do?

1832
02:01:49,535 --> 02:01:53,108
Get up, sir,
we've an arrest warrant for you.

1833
02:01:54,373 --> 02:01:56,080
What's my crime?

1834
02:01:56,208 --> 02:01:57,949
I've a list of all your companies..

1835
02:01:58,177 --> 02:01:59,850
...laundered money list of crimes.

1836
02:01:59,945 --> 02:02:03,154
And I even have all your
foreign bank account numbers.

1837
02:02:03,248 --> 02:02:05,319
- Account numbers?
- Yes.

1838
02:02:05,417 --> 02:02:10,366
Account no. Z3PCSX0009300..

1839
02:02:10,422 --> 02:02:12,163
“And many more.

1840
02:02:13,058 --> 02:02:15,004
Wow, very good.

1841
02:02:15,027 --> 02:02:17,098
Very, very good.

1842
02:02:17,329 --> 02:02:18,933
Who sent you?

1843
02:02:19,298 --> 02:02:20,606
The government.

1844
02:02:20,866 --> 02:02:22,539
And who owns the government.

1845
02:02:23,268 --> 02:02:24,975
- You do.
- So?

1846
02:02:25,103 --> 02:02:27,982
Sir, this is why I
came to meet you alone.

1847
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:31,987
Friend, catch your breath.

1848
02:02:32,411 --> 02:02:33,617
I don't have the time.

1849
02:02:33,879 --> 02:02:36,291
Okay, tell me something.
Do you like music?

1850
02:02:36,348 --> 02:02:38,385
- Yes.
- Then hear this.

1851
02:02:41,787 --> 02:02:42,925
Kill him.

1852
02:02:44,556 --> 02:02:47,093
Kill him. Kill him.

1853
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:54,139
Kill him.

1854
02:02:54,199 --> 02:02:55,906
Sir, sir, sir.

1855
02:02:58,437 --> 02:03:01,350
Satyakam's antenna's functioning.

1856
02:03:02,874 --> 02:03:05,286
Why are you committing
crime after crime after crime?

1857
02:03:10,816 --> 02:03:13,592
Crime after crime after crime?

1858
02:03:14,286 --> 02:03:17,324
Look there. It's all recorded.

1859
02:03:17,389 --> 02:03:20,529
And the entire police
team is watching you.

1860
02:03:20,993 --> 02:03:22,370
So why are you shooting?

1861
02:03:37,376 --> 02:03:41,085
"My beloved."

1862
02:03:49,121 --> 02:03:56,061
"Always stay in my sights."

1863
02:03:57,496 --> 02:04:02,878
Everyone knows I was born for you,
and I'll die for you.

1864
02:04:25,957 --> 02:04:27,527
Okay, guys, we've made
all preparations for evening.

1865
02:04:27,592 --> 02:04:29,970
Let's have a conference
tonight and tell them..

1866
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:33,376
Who are you?
What are you doing?

1867
02:04:34,366 --> 02:04:35,868
Stop it.

1868
02:04:37,469 --> 02:04:38,914
Stop it.

1869
02:04:41,273 --> 02:04:43,082
I'm calling the police.

1870
02:04:45,243 --> 02:04:46,381
Stop it!

1871
02:04:46,445 --> 02:04:48,186
What's going on?

1872
02:05:03,228 --> 02:05:07,074
At any cost we won't let
the Kakda brothers get bail.

1873
02:05:08,467 --> 02:05:10,913
They will get bail, sir.
Don't worry.

1874
02:05:11,536 --> 02:05:13,379
All under control, sir.

1875
02:05:41,933 --> 02:05:43,344
Kaanchi.

1876
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:51,011
Why did you come here?

1877
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:53,151
Who brought you here?

1878
02:05:53,211 --> 02:05:55,316
Meena sent me a letter.

1879
02:05:55,380 --> 02:05:57,382
I came running.

1880
02:05:57,816 --> 02:05:59,454
Come home with me, Kaanchi.

1881
02:05:59,518 --> 02:06:00,496
Come home.

1882
02:06:00,552 --> 02:06:03,362
I came here breaking
ties with you, mother.

1883
02:06:04,289 --> 02:06:05,791
To fight.

1884
02:06:05,857 --> 02:06:07,962
Girls don't get furious
like this, dear.

1885
02:06:08,059 --> 02:06:10,471
Only girls get furious like this.

1886
02:06:10,862 --> 02:06:13,069
Don't lecture me, mother. Go away.

1887
02:06:13,131 --> 02:06:14,201
Kaanchi.

1888
02:06:14,266 --> 02:06:17,042
I beg you Kaanchi.

1889
02:06:17,969 --> 02:06:19,539
Let's go home.
Kaanchi, stop.

1890
02:06:20,038 --> 02:06:21,312
Kaanchi, stop.

1891
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,410
Kaanchi, stop.

1892
02:06:23,508 --> 02:06:24,851
Sister.

1893
02:06:25,076 --> 02:06:26,282
Sister.

1894
02:06:26,344 --> 02:06:27,584
Kaanchi.

1895
02:06:27,913 --> 02:06:30,325
" Lonely. . .youth . "

1896
02:06:30,449 --> 02:06:33,953
"Dreams fading away."

1897
02:06:34,219 --> 02:06:35,357
Go back, mother.

1898
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:37,832
"Barren eyes."

1899
02:06:37,889 --> 02:06:40,460
"Can't cry or sing."

1900
02:06:40,525 --> 02:06:42,163
Stop, Kaanchi.

1901
02:06:42,394 --> 02:06:46,399
"Such is my pain."

1902
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:55,107
"How do I tell you my pain...
mother?"

1903
02:06:56,007 --> 02:07:02,014
"Such is my pain."

1904
02:07:02,914 --> 02:07:09,024
"How do I tell you my pain...
mother?"

1905
02:07:23,168 --> 02:07:29,449
"I've accounted some
of the small pains."

1906
02:07:30,242 --> 02:07:38,992
"Situations have shattered me,
they haven't."

1907
02:07:40,485 --> 02:07:44,331
"My view towards life has changed."

1908
02:07:47,459 --> 02:07:51,066
"I'm unique from others."

1909
02:07:51,863 --> 02:07:57,506
"Such is my pain."

1910
02:07:58,603 --> 02:08:04,610
"How do I tell you my mother?"

1911
02:08:05,443 --> 02:08:10,017
"How do I tell you my mother?"

1912
02:08:20,191 --> 02:08:21,568
Stand there quietly.

1913
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:22,964
I will shoot you.

1914
02:08:23,028 --> 02:08:24,473
I am police officer, you know.

1915
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:27,877
Look, Kaanchi, you're angry.

1916
02:08:28,199 --> 02:08:30,338
But no matter what you do,
the world won't change?

1917
02:08:31,069 --> 02:08:32,480
Will the country change?

1918
02:08:32,871 --> 02:08:34,282
What's there is there.

1919
02:08:34,539 --> 02:08:36,280
I used to say the same thing.

1920
02:08:36,341 --> 02:08:37,945
What's there is there.

1921
02:08:38,176 --> 02:08:41,055
But what there won't stay for long.

1922
02:08:41,212 --> 02:08:42,190
It won't.

1923
02:08:42,247 --> 02:08:44,318
Now only the right
thing will happen.

1924
02:08:44,382 --> 02:08:45,884
What's right!

1925
02:08:45,951 --> 02:08:47,589
This is my fight.

1926
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,163
And I will fight it alone.

1927
02:08:51,122 --> 02:08:52,499
What will you do, Bagula?

1928
02:08:52,924 --> 02:08:55,530
You bow before these devils.

1929
02:08:56,194 --> 02:09:00,165
You only run your home,
not the country.

1930
02:09:00,498 --> 02:09:04,105
And that's why you cannot shoot me.

1931
02:09:05,503 --> 02:09:07,483
Ican.

1932
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:11,150
I destroyed Shyam Kakda.

1933
02:09:11,209 --> 02:09:12,950
His power.

1934
02:09:13,011 --> 02:09:15,355
Jhoomar Babu. JB.

1935
02:09:16,147 --> 02:09:18,320
All of Shushant's strength.

1936
02:09:18,617 --> 02:09:21,427
And now I will finish Shushant.

1937
02:09:22,387 --> 02:09:24,128
You can do whatever you want.

1938
02:09:24,189 --> 02:09:25,224
Go.

1939
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:31,464
I am going,
and if you have the guts“

1940
02:09:31,529 --> 02:09:34,533
“then shoot me in the back.

1941
02:09:40,338 --> 02:09:42,011
"Jai He!"

1942
02:09:48,313 --> 02:09:49,849
"Jai He!"

1943
02:09:53,551 --> 02:09:55,155
"Jai He!"

1944
02:09:56,354 --> 02:10:00,860
"The world's so big."

1945
02:10:07,098 --> 02:10:10,170
"Let's find him."

1946
02:10:12,437 --> 02:10:15,384
"Jai He!"

1947
02:10:17,876 --> 02:10:20,413
"The world's so big."

1948
02:10:20,478 --> 02:10:23,425
"Let's find him."

1949
02:10:23,481 --> 02:10:28,954
"Where's that India that
was better than the rest?"

1950
02:10:33,992 --> 02:10:36,495
"The world's so big."

1951
02:10:36,561 --> 02:10:39,041
"Let's find him."

1952
02:10:39,064 --> 02:10:44,514
"Where's that India that
was better than the rest?"

1953
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:48,379
"Jai He!"

1954
02:10:55,313 --> 02:10:56,917
I'll apologies to her.

1955
02:10:56,948 --> 02:10:58,484
I'll convince her.

1956
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:00,052
If you bring her to me..

1957
02:11:00,118 --> 02:11:03,190
...l'll give you 5 million, in cash.

1958
02:11:03,254 --> 02:11:08,431
If you don't,
you know how dangerous I am, right.

1959
02:11:12,163 --> 02:11:14,200
Many people have calling about you.

1960
02:11:14,265 --> 02:11:16,176
- It's getting dangerous.
- I know.

1961
02:11:16,234 --> 02:11:17,872
Do one thing, go in the office.

1962
02:11:17,936 --> 02:11:19,609
Get ready and then come back.

1963
02:11:19,871 --> 02:11:25,082
"It was liberated and
was heading this way."

1964
02:11:25,143 --> 02:11:27,987
"Was lost in the way."

1965
02:11:28,046 --> 02:11:30,356
"Or has it shattered?"

1966
02:11:30,548 --> 02:11:33,028
"There was compassion."

1967
02:11:33,284 --> 02:11:35,525
"There was righteousness."

1968
02:11:35,954 --> 02:11:40,403
"We only heard about dreams."

1969
02:11:40,925 --> 02:11:42,233
"Jai He!"

1970
02:11:43,528 --> 02:11:46,168
"The world's so big."

1971
02:11:46,231 --> 02:11:49,110
"Let's find him."

1972
02:11:49,167 --> 02:11:54,207
"Where's that India that
was better than the rest?"

1973
02:11:54,272 --> 02:11:55,512
"Jai He!"

1974
02:11:55,807 --> 02:11:58,913
"Jai He!"

1975
02:11:59,410 --> 02:12:01,117
"Jai He!"

1976
02:12:10,255 --> 02:12:12,895
"It had a song too."

1977
02:12:12,957 --> 02:12:15,460
"I remember it now."

1978
02:12:15,527 --> 02:12:18,133
"And every politician's
singing it.."

1979
02:12:18,196 --> 02:12:21,006
"..without knowing it's meaning."

1980
02:12:21,065 --> 02:12:22,442
"Jai He!"

1981
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:28,244
"Tell them...we'll sing."

1982
02:12:29,007 --> 02:12:31,510
"Jai He!"

1983
02:12:31,543 --> 02:12:34,319
"We know that song."

1984
02:12:34,379 --> 02:12:36,985
"We know that song."

1985
02:12:37,048 --> 02:12:39,961
"When the people.."

1986
02:12:40,018 --> 02:12:44,330
"When the people
will be the leader.."

1987
02:12:45,023 --> 02:12:49,130
"Benefactors of their fate."

1988
02:12:50,161 --> 02:12:51,970
"Jai He!"

1989
02:12:53,031 --> 02:12:54,442
"Jai He!"

1990
02:12:55,567 --> 02:13:02,849
"Where's that India that
was better than the rest?"

1991
02:13:06,277 --> 02:13:07,881
"Jai He!"

1992
02:13:09,113 --> 02:13:14,222
"Where's that India that
was better than the rest?"

1993
02:13:14,285 --> 02:13:15,821
"Jai He!"

1994
02:13:17,121 --> 02:13:18,464
"Jai He!"

1995
02:13:20,058 --> 02:13:24,973
"Where's that India that
was better than the rest?"

1996
02:13:25,029 --> 02:13:26,269
"Jai He!"

1997
02:13:40,945 --> 02:13:42,925
"Jai He!"

1998
02:13:49,454 --> 02:13:50,558
Come.

1999
02:13:57,295 --> 02:14:00,037
Where have you brought me?

2000
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:10,576
Thank you my friend.

2001
02:14:11,809 --> 02:14:13,811
There's 5 million in that bag.

2002
02:14:14,045 --> 02:14:17,288
You kept your promise,
here's your reward.

2003
02:14:20,418 --> 02:14:21,522
Thank you, sir.

2004
02:14:21,586 --> 02:14:25,466
Forgive me for taking a peek.

2005
02:14:27,458 --> 02:14:29,404
Here's your memorabilia.

2006
02:14:30,561 --> 02:14:31,869
Can I go?

2007
02:14:32,463 --> 02:14:34,272
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

2008
02:14:40,371 --> 02:14:42,317
Thank you, sir.

2009
02:14:44,208 --> 02:14:46,449
Bagula. Rascal.

2010
02:14:46,511 --> 02:14:48,149
You betrayed me.

2011
02:14:48,212 --> 02:14:49,816
You dare sell me out.

2012
02:14:49,881 --> 02:14:52,088
I will kill you first.

2013
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:53,390
Bagula.

2014
02:15:21,379 --> 02:15:22,585
Obsession.

2015
02:15:23,014 --> 02:15:25,585
Obsession.

2016
02:15:26,985 --> 02:15:29,022
After you left...

2017
02:15:29,253 --> 02:15:34,168
...l could see only your
face in every painting.

2018
02:15:36,027 --> 02:15:37,904
Your gleam.

2019
02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:41,441
Your eyes.

2020
02:15:43,768 --> 02:15:45,406
These cheeks.

2021
02:15:47,905 --> 02:15:50,909
These lips.

2022
02:15:51,776 --> 02:15:53,551
I still love you.

2023
02:15:54,946 --> 02:15:57,426
I will make another
painting of you.

2024
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:00,056
Naked.

2025
02:16:01,352 --> 02:16:02,558
Nude.

2026
02:16:23,508 --> 02:16:26,853
You can kill me if you want.

2027
02:16:27,245 --> 02:16:29,088
No so easily.

2028
02:16:31,082 --> 02:16:36,464
You should feel the same pain I did.

2029
02:16:38,156 --> 02:16:39,100
Look.

2030
02:16:41,426 --> 02:16:42,496
Look. Look.

2031
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:43,565
Look.

2032
02:17:45,156 --> 02:17:47,966
Ba**** wrong timing.

2033
02:17:48,025 --> 02:17:49,595
Sir, this is not the way.

2034
02:17:49,861 --> 02:17:51,306
Out.

2035
02:17:51,596 --> 02:17:54,042
Sir, this isn't right.
Sigdi snatched my gun.

2036
02:17:54,098 --> 02:17:55,236
I am a police officer, sir.

2037
02:17:55,299 --> 02:17:57,108
- Out.
- This isn't right, sir.

2038
02:17:57,168 --> 02:17:58,909
You bring Kaanchi's sister
home and don't tell me.

2039
02:17:58,970 --> 02:18:00,278
- This isn't right.
- Out.

2040
02:18:00,338 --> 02:18:02,477
This isn't right,
sir, you're pointing a gun at me.

2041
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:05,248
I am your servant, your friend.
I am loyal to you.

2042
02:18:05,309 --> 02:18:07,016
And you're pointing
a gun at me. At me.

2043
02:18:07,078 --> 02:18:11,424
There's just one way to show you.
And that is to kill you, sir.

2044
02:18:11,482 --> 02:18:13,359
Kaanchi, run away.

2045
02:18:13,417 --> 02:18:14,589
I'll deal with this rascal.

2046
02:18:15,453 --> 02:18:16,864
"Jai He."

2047
02:18:21,058 --> 02:18:22,230
"Jai He."

2048
02:18:26,330 --> 02:18:27,365
"Jai He."

2049
02:18:28,866 --> 02:18:31,870
Now watch my way.

2050
02:18:32,069 --> 02:18:34,879
Take this. And that.

2051
02:18:34,939 --> 02:18:37,078
And this.

2052
02:18:51,255 --> 02:18:52,256
Nini.

2053
02:18:52,423 --> 02:18:53,834
Nini.

2054
02:19:01,566 --> 02:19:03,273
Fight.

2055
02:22:06,484 --> 02:22:09,260
Kill me.

2056
02:22:10,855 --> 02:22:12,528
Kill me.

2057
02:22:35,212 --> 02:22:38,125
So where did Kaanchi go?

2058
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:42,489
To her village Koshampa.

2059
02:22:43,053 --> 02:22:44,532
With her mother.

2060
02:22:46,323 --> 02:22:47,893
Just like Kakda fled from Koshampa..

2061
02:22:47,992 --> 02:22:50,063
“Without leaving any evidence.

2062
02:22:50,227 --> 02:22:53,470
Similarly,
Kaanchi returned to her village“

2063
02:22:53,531 --> 02:22:55,238
“without leaving any evidence.

2064
02:22:55,366 --> 02:22:59,143
You mean Kaanchi fled from the law.

2065
02:23:01,972 --> 02:23:04,316
One, two, three, four.

2066
02:23:04,375 --> 02:23:05,581
Come on, come on, jump.

2067
02:23:05,843 --> 02:23:09,290
Jump, come on.
One, two, three, four.

2068
02:23:09,413 --> 02:23:10,915
<i>Faster.</i>

2069
02:23:11,982 --> 02:23:17,523
"Stay in my sights."

2070
02:23:18,889 --> 02:23:25,499
"Stay in my sights."

2071
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:36,013
Sir.

2072
02:23:42,012 --> 02:23:46,154
Is it true that you gave
orders to close Kaanchi's file?

2073
02:23:46,417 --> 02:23:48,294
What do you think?

2074
02:23:48,886 --> 02:23:50,263
Who is right?

2075
02:23:50,554 --> 02:23:52,465
Kaanchi or Kakda.

2076
02:23:54,425 --> 02:23:56,962
Sir, there's tremendous
pressure from the superiors.

2077
02:23:57,795 --> 02:23:59,274
I'm getting calls from Delhi.

2078
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:01,503
- Let it ring.
- But, sir..

2079
02:24:01,866 --> 02:24:03,243
Leave it.

2080
02:24:07,171 --> 02:24:10,243
You do know Arindham
Barua from Delhi Office.

2081
02:24:10,307 --> 02:24:11,411
'75 batch.

2082
02:24:11,475 --> 02:24:14,046
One day when he was
drunk he told me that“

2083
02:24:14,111 --> 02:24:16,853
“the minister gave
him his unnamed flat“

2084
02:24:16,914 --> 02:24:20,157
...to change two lines in his report.

2085
02:24:21,151 --> 02:24:23,961
More than 60%
politician politicians“

2086
02:24:24,021 --> 02:24:28,970
...have amassed from 100
to 1000 crores in 10 years.

2087
02:24:29,426 --> 02:24:31,372
From system.

2088
02:24:33,163 --> 02:24:36,235
The law is sold outside the court.

2089
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:38,537
Deals are made with the media.

2090
02:24:39,136 --> 02:24:41,946
MLAs are bought and
sold in party politics.

2091
02:24:42,006 --> 02:24:45,180
MPs are bought and sold.

2092
02:24:46,911 --> 02:24:49,448
Businessmen make the
news laws of business.

2093
02:24:49,513 --> 02:24:50,491
Wow!

2094
02:24:51,815 --> 02:24:53,192
You do know that.

2095
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:56,026
You, me, we all know it.

2096
02:24:56,387 --> 02:24:58,367
Yet, we keep quiet.

2097
02:24:58,923 --> 02:25:01,426
Because we're slaves of the system.

2098
02:25:02,059 --> 02:25:05,165
And these politicians
make this system, control it..

2099
02:25:05,229 --> 02:25:06,970
“And break it too.

2100
02:25:09,266 --> 02:25:13,339
Corruption dwells
in our blood, Gautam.

2101
02:25:15,406 --> 02:25:16,885
What a shame.

2102
02:25:17,041 --> 02:25:22,992
But Kaanchi's the new youth.

2103
02:25:23,447 --> 02:25:26,087
She gave a fitting reply
to a power like Kakda..

2104
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:28,187
...from her system.

2105
02:25:28,819 --> 02:25:32,130
And said...Fear no Evil.

2106
02:25:32,823 --> 02:25:36,066
And do what is right.

2107
02:25:39,229 --> 02:25:42,108
And that's why I
closed Kaanchi's file.

2108
02:25:42,366 --> 02:25:45,040
And I know I'm doing
the right thing.

2109
02:25:45,235 --> 02:25:47,408
Because I feel good.

2110
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:54,287
Kaanchi!

2111
02:25:54,445 --> 02:25:56,118
Kaanchi!

2112
02:25:56,313 --> 02:25:57,951
Kaanchi!

2113
02:25:58,082 --> 02:25:59,823
Kaanchi!

2114
02:25:59,984 --> 02:26:01,520
Kaanchi!

2115
02:26:01,852 --> 02:26:03,331
Kaanchi!

2116
02:26:03,487 --> 02:26:05,194
Kaanchi!

2117
02:26:15,065 --> 02:26:16,100
You know, Kaanchi..

2118
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:18,077
“Both the Kakdas were
sentenced to 15 years ofjail.

2119
02:26:18,135 --> 02:26:21,548
The court has also
cancelled Kakda's project.

2120
02:26:21,805 --> 02:26:24,217
Koshampa's lands were returned too.

2121
02:26:24,274 --> 02:26:26,151
With the grace of God.

2122
02:26:26,210 --> 02:26:27,120
Right.

2123
02:26:27,177 --> 02:26:29,020
You were furious for
no reason and left us.

2124
02:26:29,079 --> 02:26:32,060
Everything became
alright after you. Right?

2125
02:26:32,116 --> 02:26:34,153
"Kaanchi."

2126
02:26:35,052 --> 02:26:36,827
"Kaanchi."

2127
02:27:21,265 --> 02:27:28,479
"Stay in my sights."

2128
02:27:29,973 --> 02:27:37,482
"Stay in my sights."
