1
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,251
'That's life...'

2
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,417
'One moment, they were cruising
through the beautiful valleys.'

3
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,042
'And now...'

4
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:13,834
'They are hanging on the wall.'

5
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,792
'But, what will you
call these identical twins?'

6
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,542
'Lucky...or Unlucky?'

7
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,876
'Unlucky because their
parents are no more.'

8
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,292
'And lucky, because these twins...'

9
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,667
'...didn't fall apart
like the 'Twin Towers.'

10
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:34,751
'Presenting their bachelor
uncle Kartar Singh.'

11
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,834
'It took him a day and a half...'

12
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,626
'...to realize that raising
them is not his cup of tea.

13
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:44,709
'And so...he estranged the children,
like himself.'

14
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,042
'He gave the child on his left...'

15
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:49,001
'...to his sister Jeeto
who lived in London.'

16
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,376
'And, the kid on his right...'

17
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,292
'...to his brother Baldev.'

18
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,584
'Who in the world gives
children like this?'

19
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,792
'Thing's got complicated.'

20
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,459
'They were brother's...'

21
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:02,709
'...but now, they became cousins.'

22
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,042
Jeeto was their aunt...'

23
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,001
...but now,
she's a mother to one of the kids.'

24
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:08,959
'Baldev was their uncle...'

25
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,209
'...but now he's the
father of the other.'

26
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:15,709
'Kartar is still their uncle,
but it's complicated.'

27
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,626
'A single accident
changed everything.'

28
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,584
'But there's one thing
that hasn't changed.'

29
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,251
'These two were identical twins...'

30
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,751
...and they still look...identical.'

31
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:37,792
"O Lord... Almighty."

32
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:45,042
"We begin every task with thy name."

33
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,709
"We wield your sacred bracelet."

34
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:57,667
"We never hear no
evil...or speak no evil."

35
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:05,417
"We set examples for others."

36
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,084
"There's none like us..."

37
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:13,334
"Our gait's like a lion!"

38
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:18,251
"Our gait's like a lion!"

39
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,626
"Our swag's trend-setting."

40
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,417
"We're perfect in every field."

41
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:44,417
"Our swag's trend-setting."

42
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,751
"We're perfect in every field."

43
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,376
"We look handsome in suit and shoes."

44
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:51,667
"And wet tresses."

45
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:56,709
"Collars straight..."
"...but we're rustic at heart."

46
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,834
"Don't try to mess with us."

47
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:04,167
"Jatt arrives riding a Jaguar.."

48
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:07,042
"...with gorgeous girls in tow."

49
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:09,167
"Jatt arrives riding a Jaguar.."

50
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,834
"...with gorgeous girls in tow."

51

"...we spend our lives having fun."

55
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,126
"We get high and party all night."

56
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,626
"And next morning wakeup late."

57
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,084
"Girls say...be my babe."

58
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:51,292
"And steal my heart."

59
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:56,167
"Our car flies...in the air."

60
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,751
"Our car flies in the air."

61
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:02,292
"We always say to the world."

62
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,792
"Jatt arrives riding a Jaguar.."

"We love everyone, big and small."

68
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:42,209
"We belong to a brave community."

69
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,542
"Never stab anyone in the back."

70
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:46,542
"Its quite simple..."

71
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,917
"...don't waste your time."

72
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,626
"Its quite simple..."

73
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:55,126
"...don't waste your
time in useless things."

74
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,126
"We're Sardars after all..."

75
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,917
"...we spend our lives having fun."

"...we spend our lives having fun."

78
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,042
"Jatt arrives riding a Jaguar.."

79
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:11,834
"...with gorgeous girls in tow."

80
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,084
"Jatt arrives riding a Jaguar.."

81
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,126
"...with gorgeous girls in tow."

82
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,417
What? Are you in the same mall?

83
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,667
Yeah...what to do.
I came here shopping with my mom.

84
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:27,126
Who does shopping with his mom?

85
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,667
Mama's boy!

86
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,209
Are you okay?

87
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,834
Hey...what are you giggling about?
- Excuse me!

88
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:40,167
Excuse you? Why?
- Here's your bag.

89
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,001
Hello.
- They just flock here from India.

90
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,501
Hello... you're not
exactly chinese either.

91
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,542
Huh...

92
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,626
Sweety, who are you arguing with now?

93
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,667
This old lady slipped on her own...

94
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:50,959
...and now she's yelling at me.

95
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,417
Old...! You called me 'old'.

96
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,376
What else should I call you? Baby?

97
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,626
Oh, my...lil' sweet baby...
did you fall down?

98
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,584
Did you get hurt, baby?

99
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:02,584
Which old lady are
you s***ng with now?

100
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:05,751
Wait... Wait and
watch what I do to you.

101
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:06,667
What can you do?

102
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:10,126
My son's in this mall too.
- So is my boyfriend.

103
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,417
So call him... and we'll
let them fight it out.

104
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:20,876
Karan!

105
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,584
She's my mom!
Mom! Mom! Mom!

106
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,376
Right... I get it... Mom!

107
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,084
Now call your boyfriend.

108
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:36,334
And watch Karan beat
the crap out of him.

109
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,709
How can I beat the crap out of myself?
- Huh?

110
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,209
I mean... where's your boyfriend?

111
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:42,334
I'll beat the crap out of him!
Where is he? Where is he?

112
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,876
No-no-no-no-no, aunty...
I am very sorry.

113
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,917
It was completely my fault...
my mistake. Please forgive me.

114
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,542
She's genuinely apologizing mom,
let her go.

115
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,584
Not even if she apologizes
a thousand times.

116
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,251
After all, I am 'Old'.

117
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,209
Old?
- Oh, my...lil' sweety...did you fall down?

118
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:59,084
She called me 'Old'.
- No...

119
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,792
What now? What now?

120
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:03,542
I'll get coffee for you.
- Yeah...

121
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:04,584
... without sugar.
- No-no-no...

122
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,167
She will slip poison into it.

123
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,042
Never.

124
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,251
Her boyfriend must be blind...
that's why he's still with her.

125
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:13,917
She will treat him like a servant.

126
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:17,709
I pity her father-in-law.

127
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:22,709
Aunty...
- And no respect for her mother-in-law.

128
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:58,292
Who is this Binkle?

129
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:01,167
I had no clue that mom...

130
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:03,626
I knew that 'old'...

131
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,459
I mean, your mom was definitely
going to cause trouble.

132
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,126
And how did this Binkle
suddenly come in the picture.

133
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,126
No, actually, we already knew...
- I see...

134
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:12,876
So, you were already planning this.

135
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,792
Sweety, Binkle is Mr. Sandhu's daughter.

136
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,084
Sandhu sir helped dad
in setting up business.

137
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:19,876
He's our Godfather.
- I see...

138
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:22,167
And now you're planning
on making him your Father...

139
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,084
...and repay that favor.

140
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:24,959
I was only time-pass for you.
- Time-pass?

141
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,709
Sweety, as soon as
you finished your course...

142
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,584
...I followed you all the way here.

143
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,834
I've been stirring ladies all day...

144
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,584
You think I like
this restaurant and all.

145
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,084
Who am I doing it for? You of course.

146
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:35,667
But what's the point?

147
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,459
You've been saying for the last six
months that you'll talk to your uncle.

148
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,001
Then, your uncle will
talk to your mother.

149
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,126
Everything will be rocking.
But what actually happened?

150
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:45,042
You should talk to your mom directly.

151
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:47,001
Did you leave me a choice?

152
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:49,001
I told you I will introduce you to
my mom when the time is right.

153
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,334
But, no. You went and
introduced yourself to her.

154
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,584
"That Old lady slipped.
That Old lady slipped."

155
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,334
All moms are old.

156
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:56,376
But you don't call them 'Old'.

157
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,126
Fine, but what do we do next?

158
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:07,001
Sandhu's are interested in our family.
- Yeah, so?

159
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,542
So Binkle will get married...

160
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,751
...and in our family.

161
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,376
So...

162
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,376
So...

163
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:20,459
You promised you'll talk.

164
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:25,084
Father was in a bad mood yesterday.

165
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,126
The fritters were burnt.

166
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:28,417
The fritters were burnt.

167
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,001
Now our future depends on fritters.

168
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:34,376
Look Nafisa,
papa's flying to London tomorrow...

169
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,001
...to discuss Karan's wedding.

170
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:38,917
So, in his absence
I'll talk with aunt Jeeto.

171
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,584
So you're not angry anymore?
- No...

172
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,542
You said 'absence'.

173
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:45,834
It's the effect of your company.

174
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,709
Charan, you'll have to
talk to your father someday.

175
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,751
So aunt Jeeto will talk to him.

176
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:55,542
Father reveres her like God.
He can never say no to her.

177
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,292
And anyway, aunt Jeeto doesn't
have a problem with you guys.

178
00:13:58,709 --> 00:13:59,834
'You guys'?

179
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,292
You mean Muslim angle.

180
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:06,417
Doesn't matter if its Muslim,
Christian or Gujarati.

181
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:08,376
They are all outsiders for father.

182
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:11,126
He wants a proper,
Sikh, daughter-in-law.

183
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,292
I can't do this anymore.

184
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:21,542
Hello.

185
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,001
Tittu...
- Hello.

186
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:24,584
Keep stirring the lentil.

187
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:27,001
But only I will temper it.

188
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:30,167
Hello, uncle.
- Hello, son.

189
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:31,751
Bless you...

190
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:36,209
Have you finished packing?
- Uncle, do I have to go?

191
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,876
Of course not, I'll go marry her.

192
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:40,917
"Uncle, do I have to go."

193
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:43,667
We're talking about
your marriage, stupid!

194
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,667
But uncle,
I don't want to get married right now.

195
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:49,834
Why?

196
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,667
I still have to learn
so much from you.

197
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:57,542
And, I still have to open a chain
of 'Purani Haveli' (Restaurants)!

198
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,667
chain?
- Yeah...

199
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:04,042
New York, London, Paris, Switzerland.

200
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,042
International?
- Uncle...

201
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:09,417
Uncle! We haven't opened up yet...
It's still work in progress.

202
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,376
But how are you going to do it?

203
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,042
You hardly come to the restaurant.

204
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:17,334
Maybe once in a couple of weeks.

205
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,542
But I always finish my work.

206
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,209
Right, Tittu?
- Yes.

207
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,126
It's a talent, uncle. God gift.

208
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,584
You see, even in my
school and college days...

209
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,917
...I would study a day or two
before the exams and top my class.

210
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:32,834
A guy should be smart-working,
not hard-working.

211
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:36,001
Fine, son, but...
- You know, uncle.

212
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:41,792
I love you the most.
- I do, son.

213
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,667
But sister Jeeto insists
we cannot miss this proposal.

214
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:48,376
Binkle is a great girl.

215
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:50,376
Even our boy is nothing
short than best.

216
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,667
Boy?
- charan.

217
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:55,626
I know his name starts with C...

218
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,709
...but he's the best.

219
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:02,501
charan?
- charan!

220
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:05,417
Charan.

221
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,792
What happened, Dad?
Why did you make so many calls?

222
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,251
My shift is over.
I'm coming back to home.

223
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,542
Hello, mom.
- Bless you, son.

224
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:31,667
Ready? - It's all coincidence, sister.
- That's true.

225
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,417
And Charan is a lucky boy.
- Yes.

226
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:35,709
Hello, aunty.

227
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:38,626
Bless you! Are you happy?

228
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,001
Huh!
- Happy?

229
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,709
Why wouldn't he be happy?
- Charan, where's your black sweater?

230
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:47,751
My black sweater?
- It's cold out there.

231
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:51,501
Baldev, did you speak with Charan?

232
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:54,751
What's to ask?
Whatever I saw is final.

233
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:58,876
Brother, which one should I pack?
- Fine... see you tomorrow.

234
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,209
I'll pack all three.
- Kartar will receive you at the airport.

235
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,167
Okay, sister. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

236
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,417
Why are you packing my stuff?

237
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,917
Now your going to see the girl.

238
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:12,751
But Karan was supposed to see the girl...
- Now, it's going to be you.

239
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,167
He's going to open a chain.

240
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:19,459
chain?
- Aunty, Charan's black sweater.

241
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,001
I don't want to get married.

242
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,292
Why don't you want to get married?

243
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,001
Any girlfriend angle?

244
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:30,001
No... no...
- So what's the problem?

245
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,251
Why are you saying no?
- I never said no.

246
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,167
Congratulations, uncle.
He said 'yes'.

247
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:36,501
I never said 'yes'.

248
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:40,376
Are you stupid?
You're neither saying yes nor no.

249
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:41,876
Uncle, I think he's embarrassed.

250
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:44,001
I'm sure his heart's
jumping with glee.

251
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:45,542
We've to wake up
early morning tomorrow.

252
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:46,876
So get some sleep.

253
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:50,417
Minto... is dinner ready?

254
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:52,584
I always heard that
brother sc*** brother.

255
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:53,751
But now I've seen it.

256
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:56,417
What are you saying?
I'm your elder brother.

257
00:17:56,501 --> 00:18:00,251
And you know, I love you the most.

258
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:04,292
And listen,
I planned everything carefully.

259
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,792
Binkle is a very good girl.

260
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,876
If she's such a good girl,
why don't you marry her?

261
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,584
She's not my type,
she's too simple and well-behaved.

262
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,376
What do you mean by well-behaved?
Do you want a naughty wife?

263
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:17,584
No, I want Sweety... I mean,
someone sweet, sexy and happening.

264
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,292
And what's all this
talk about a 'chain'?

265
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,876
Fine, I'll take it off.
Can't seem to open it.

266
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,584
And anyway,
no one gets any peace after marriage.

267
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,792
I am not going to London.

268
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,501
Brother Baldev has landed.

269
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,251
Where do I park?

270
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,626
I am coming, brother.

271
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,084
No Smoking's fine...

272
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:17,417
...but, I don't see a
'No Parking' board anywhere.

273
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,792
Let's park here.

274
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,501
Good old 'No Parking'.

275
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,334
Papa, Uncle Kartar's here.
- Brother.

276
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,417
He's here?

277
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:31,584
Greetings, brother.

278
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,959
Greetings.

279
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,334
Feels so nice.

280
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,042
How are you, Kartar?

281
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:41,126
It's the grace of God.

282
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:46,417
Greetings, uncle. - Oh, no-no-no,
don't touch my feet, my lad.

283
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,834
Turban looks good on you.

284
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,501
come on, my boy.

285
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:53,334
Where's your car, Kartar?
- There it is, brother.

286
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:56,417
Uncle...you're being fined.

287
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,501
Hello, sir... you under the car.

288
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,334
The London Police isn't smart enough
to get money out of Kartar.

289
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:02,334
Come on.

290
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,834
Sir, I am talking to you.
- Excuse me, officer.

291
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:07,126
Any problem? - You know you have
parked in a No Parking zone.

292
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:08,792
What to do?
The car broke down, sir.

293
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,751
And why isn't your
mechanic talking to me?

294
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,709
Oh, he's deaf and dumb I see.
- Yes officer.

295
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,542
Right... Get your car
fixed as soon as possible.

296
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,876
Thanks, officer.
- And be on your way

297
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,584
come on, boy...come out!

298
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:34,876
You've grown heavy.
- What the...

299
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,667
What's this, Kartar?
- Indian style, brother.

300
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,292
Let's move, shall we?
Get in the truck.

301
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,959
So young man,
you're finally taking the leap.

302
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:49,292
You must be really happy.
- Why not?

303
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,167
Not like you...

304
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,709
Wasting your whole
life for one person?

305
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:56,209
Forget it, brother. Forget it...

306
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:59,584
Only old whiskey tastes nice,
not old memories.

307
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,626
Where are we going?

308
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,709
I built a second home in London.

309
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,751
My very own Mini Punjab.

310
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,834
Wow... this is amazing.

311
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,792
Mini Punjab in London.

312
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,792
Here guys, have some buttermilk.

313
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:25,001
Bring it on...man.

314
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,167
You've turned Jolly
into a complete Punjabi.

315
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,584
He's still learning, brother.

316
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,501
When he starts swearing...

317
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:32,876
...that's when he'll
be a complete Punjabi.

318
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,501
I've been calling for so long, Charan.

319
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,209
Why weren't you answering my calls?
- I've planted vegetables.

320
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:39,834
I was with Papa and Kartar uncle.
- Potatoes...

321
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:43,126
Kartar uncle? Where are you?

322
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,876
London!
- London?

323
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:47,542
What the hell are you doing in London?

324
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:53,626
Oh yes, Kartar.
Here's your stuff you asked for.

325
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,792
Oh my, my, my... the soil of Punjab.

326
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,417
Jolly, my bro, come here.
- Yeah.

327
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,334
Sprinkle this soil of
Punjab all over the farm.

328
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,542
It should smell like home.

329
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,626
Go on, scatter it around.

330
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:13,126
But Nafisa,
I don't want to marry her either.

331
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:16,501
Good! So no need to
go over to the Sandhus. - Yes.

332
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,167
And, let me know if
you're still going over.

333
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:20,751
So I can My tell father...

334
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,417
...to find a real man for me

335
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:23,751
Charan!

336
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,126
You've been glued to the phone.
Come here.

337
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:28,542
Yes...coming.
- Brother, you're a grown up now...

338
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:30,167
...but, still no
change in your temper.

339
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:32,959
Shoots up like BP suddenly.

340
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:36,417
Charan, we're getting late.

341
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:48,542
Jolly, my bro...
- Yeah.

342
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,959
Sprinkle some of the soil in the backyard.
- Okay.

343
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:51,917
Sister.

344
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:55,042
Mom-Dad, uncle's here.
- They are.

345
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,292
Brother...
- Greetings, uncle. - Bless you...

346
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:00,626
Hello, brother-in-law.

347
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:04,417
What took you so long?
- Come here, my Sunshine.

348
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,126
Baldev!

349
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:08,251
Sister.

350
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:10,459
Hello, sister.
- Bless you.

351
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:12,709
My brother.

352
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:21,084
Don't you miss your sister?
- You're crying, sister.

353
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:24,834
Of course,
we're meeting after 5 years.

354
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:26,959
We just had a video-chat yesterday

355
00:23:27,126 --> 00:23:29,417
Isn't there a difference between chatting
on video and meeting face-to-face?

356
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,376
Can I slap you on screen?

357
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,834
Look at him.
- Hello, sister.

358
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,292
Bless you.

359
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:42,417
He's all grown up now.

360
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:43,667
Just like Karan.

361
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:45,626
Naughty...

362
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:47,876
Feels just like yesterday.

363
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:49,959
You used to prance around
in the courtyard naked.

364
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:52,042
"Aunty, Karan hit me.

365
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:54,042
Aunty, I am hungry."

366
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:55,584
And look at him now.

367
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,584
The young man's off to get married.

368
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:59,584
The lad's grown up, huh!

369
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,334
If only brother and
sister-in-law were alive.

370
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,792
They would've been so happy
to see their son get married.

371
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:10,917
No, sister.

372
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:12,751
Don't cry, Let's go.

373
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,542
One must not shed tears
on joyous occasions.

374
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:19,209
Yes.. - Let's go inside.
Come on. - Come inside.

375
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,792
Go easy on the drink, Kartar.

376
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:30,542
There's no such thing as 'Easy'
or 'Gentle' in Kartar's dictionary.

377
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,792
He's right.
- He'll never learn.

378
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:34,709
Mr. Singh.
- Yes.

379
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:37,959
It's 1 am.
- But my brother's here from India.

380
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:41,417
So for the next three days...
"Do not Disturb"!

381
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:44,417
Yes... go sleep, my lovely neighbor.

382
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:48,876
Look at them.
- They love there family so much.

383
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:51,167
Nice Jolly.

384
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:55,167
Tell me something, sister...

385
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:57,959
Is Mr. Sandhu happy
with this alliance?

386
00:24:58,251 --> 00:24:59,709
Why wouldn't he be happy?

387
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,959
He's more interested in
a relationship with our family.

388
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:06,126
Doesn't matter if its Karan or charan.

389
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:09,042
In fact, he was saying that...

390
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:12,542
...post wedding he'll have an excuse
to visit Punjab more frequently.

391
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,709
But Ballu, are you happy?

392
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,417
Sister...

393
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:19,459
For us, it's God up there
and down here it's you.

394
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:23,167
You said it... end of story.

395
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:25,834
So is brother-in-law's bottle.

396
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:29,917
Come, Charan, let's get another
bottle for brother-in-law.

397
00:25:30,084 --> 00:25:30,876
come, my boy. come.

398
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:34,626
Yes, uncle. - charan, go. - Brother-in-law,
don't you think you're drinking too much.

399
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:37,251
Yeah... All thanks to Kartar.

400
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:39,417
What's the matter?
- And now charan's going with Kartar.

401
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:41,709
God save that boy.
- What's the problem?

402
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,751
What?
- Uncle...

403
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,626
Then why come here?

404
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:47,042
Why didn't you tell your father?

405
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:48,792
You know him...

406
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,292
Is your girlfriend
from a decent family?

407
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,834
She's from a great family.

408
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,542
Her father's a doctor, mother is cA.

409
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:56,959
And Nafisa is a lawyer herself.

410
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,834
Then what's the problem?

411
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,084
What did you say her name was?

412
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:07,709
Nafisa...

413
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:11,251
Nafisa. And...
- Yes.

414
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:14,626
Qureshi.
- Qureshi!

415
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,709
Nafisa Qureshi!

416
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:20,709
Your father doesn't even
allow Mughlai dishes on his menu.

417
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,834
And you fell for a Mughlai girl?

418
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:23,834
Mughlai?

419
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,001
You make it sound like
she's Akbar's niece.

420
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,042
She has no association or connection
with the Mughals, uncle.

421
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:32,917
Association'... 'Connection'...
Such big words.

422
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,667
I hope you've not forgotten Punjabi.

423
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:38,251
Hey, Kartar.
- High...

424
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:40,959
Stupid...
Bloody drug addict.

425
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,417
Look, charan.
- Yes.

426
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:46,126
We could've handled anyone else.

427
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:49,376
But, we cannot say no to Sandhu sir.
- Correct.

428
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:53,126
Only he can reject you.

429
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,626
But why will he reject me?

430
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,542
Yeah...you don't have
any bad habits or vices.

431
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:04,792
What happened, uncle?

432
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,459
I found a vice.
- You did.

433
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:11,084
I know one of your bad habits.
- You do.

434
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:16,459
If Sandhu finds out that
you're a drug addict, then...

435
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,501
But who will believe
that I am a drug addict?

436
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:20,834
You just landed from Punjab.

437
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:22,751
Haven't you seen 'Udta Punjab.'

438
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,834
If has a small doubt...

439
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,001
...then this wedding
will get cancelled.

440
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:30,667
Let's think of another idea, uncle.

441
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:32,876
You think I am Bernard Shaw.

442
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,417
I came up with this
idea after watching him.

443
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,751
Another idea?

444
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:37,876
This one's good.

445
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,501
Come... come, my lad.

446
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,167
Good morning, Ma'am.

447
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:53,917
Did you see their house?
- Welcome.

448
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,584
Come on, let's start. Udta Punjab.

449
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:57,542
How is it?

450
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,709
Are you okay, my lad?
Are you okay?

451
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,459
What's wrong with him?
- What happened?

452
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:03,959
What happened?
- He was feeling sick in the car.

453
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:06,834
He's going to see the girl,
so he's just scared.

454
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:08,459
Be brave my boy.

455
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:10,292
come.
- Sandhu sir. Sandhu sir.

456
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:15,917
Hello, Sandhu sir.
- Welcome. Greetings. - Hello.

457
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:17,709
Sister-in-law was telling me...

458
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:20,084
...that, you own a
big restaurant in Punjab

459
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:22,876
It's the grace of God.

460
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:24,959
Enough to make a living.

461
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:26,792
Is it a vegetarian restaurant?

462
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,501
No, son. We make meat and fish too.

463
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:34,959
Except for Mughlai.

464
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,542
What..
- It's called 'Purani Haveli'.

465
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:43,209
Purani Haveli.
- It's a really nice name, very nice.

466
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:46,751
Yes, very nice name.

467
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:49,501
Charan, do you work
at the restaurant...

468
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:50,751
...or do you do something else?

469
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,667
He's a car dealer.
- Yes.

470
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:53,751
He's a got a big showroom.

471
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,084
Is he dumb?
- Why?

472
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:57,167
Why?

473
00:28:57,376 --> 00:29:00,167
Let him speak. Come on, bro.

474
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,001
I have a car dealership.

475
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:04,667
Renault. Renault Showroom.

476
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,792
Is everything okay, charan?

477
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,834
Yes, uncle.

478
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:18,501
Go get Binkle.
- Yeah...that's good.

479
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,626
Yes... go get her.

480
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:23,792
His face turned red
like a monkey's bum...

481
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:25,459
...on hearing Binkle's name.

482
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:27,292
He's always been a shy kid.

483
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,959
Stays away from girls.
- I see...

484
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,917
Meaning?
- I mean... he's got more guy friends.

485
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:37,542
Take Facebook for instance.
He has 609 friends.

486
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:38,751
All boys.

487
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,584
No females, only male.

488
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,959
He's a very friendly guy.

489
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:45,084
Kartar.

490
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,667
Dad, could he be one of those?

491
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:51,751
You know, too-friendly.
- Like you know everything.

492
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:05,417
Aah... that's Binkle.

493
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,876
Hello.
- Hello, dear. Bless you.

494
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:11,167
Hello.
- Hello.

495
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:23,626
Binkle dear, won't you
show Charan around the house?

496
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,751
Go on, son.
- Go, son.

497
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,459
Go, boy. It's your day.

498
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:30,667
Rock...

499
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:31,959
Rock!

500
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:33,376
Go.

501
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,376
What happened?
- Careful, son.

502
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,876
charan, are you feeling okay?
Be careful.

503
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:44,751
What are you saying, Kartar?

504
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:48,501
He's feeling okay. Looks absolutely fine.
- I don't think so, brother.

505
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:50,584
He was puking all the way.
- I see...

506
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:53,917
He was sweating,
shaking, his hands were shivering.

507
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:57,292
No-no-no...maybe it's jet lag.

508
00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:00,292
Since when did 'Jatts'
start getting jetlag?

509
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,042
I think there is a problem.

510
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:05,584
Very worrying.

511
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:13,001
Well, you can ask anything you want.

512
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:16,751
What can I ask?
It's my first time.

513
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,292
Mine too...

514
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:24,542
Well, I'll ask then...
Do you have a...

515
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:47,042
What happened?
- Nothing.

516
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:51,709
I was asking...
Do you have a girlfriend?

517
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,501
I...
- You can take it if it's important.

518
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,042
It is important.

519
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:07,834
Hello... Hello...

520
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:11,917
It got disconnected.

521
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:14,751
Strange... we don't
have a network issue.

522
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,876
So... why can't you get a connection?

523
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:25,209
'Don't worry. I'll break this allience.'

524
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:29,209
Are you okay?

525
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:33,209
My throat... Water...
- Yeah, sure...

526
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:34,251
Thank you.

527
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:37,626
Wait, Uncle, let me first
decide what I want in life.

528
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:42,542
Manpreet,
you had a friend called Happy.

529
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,751
His hands would shiver,
he would sweat...

530
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,084
What was his problem?

531
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:50,792
No problem...
He used to do drugs.

532
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:52,001
Have some more, uncle.

533
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:53,876
Drugs?
- You're right.

534
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:55,501
So drugs lead to these problems?

535
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,334
He really respects his elders.

536
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:59,251
Does charan...

537
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,917
No-no-no, he's a good boy.
- It's hard to find kids like him.

538
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:04,709
IN fact, he's old school.

539
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,209
Excuse me.

540
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,667
So is Binkle...
- Hello.

541
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,501
Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

542
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:11,167
I think they make a good pair.

543
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:12,709
There's definitely
a network problem here.

544
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,792
Hello.

545
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:16,542
Hello.
- Can't hear anything.

546
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,001
Hello. Hello...

547
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,292
Good Lord, someone has fallen.

548
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,917
Oh no.
- Who is it?

549
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,709
Who fell down? Charan fell down!

550
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:30,417
How did he fall down?

551
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,876
Charan.
- Get some water.

552
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:34,542
Son, call the doctor.
- Get some water.

553
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,626
He's breathing. He's still breathing.
- Get some water.

554
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:41,084
Get some water. - Sandhu sir,
does this house have some water?

555
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:44,084
Someone get water.
- He's still breathing.

556
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:46,042
He's breathing.
- Someone get water.

557
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,417
You okay, my boy.

558
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:56,542
Get up, Tiger. Get up.

559
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:58,084
Get up.

560
00:33:58,376 --> 00:33:59,459
He's okay.
- Get up.

561
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:02,417
But...how did this happen?
- Everything's okay...it's all okay.

562
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,376
Everything's okay...
it's all okay.

563
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,167
Sandhu sir,
now let's fix a wedding date.

564
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,459
come on, let's go inside.

565
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:09,792
come. - Come on.
- One minute!

566
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:16,251
Tell me honestly...
you do drugs, don't you?

567
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:17,334
Hey...

568
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,042
He's my son... My son!

569
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,876
He will never do anything wrong,
understand.

570
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:26,584
Uncle, this is a question
of Binkle's life.

571
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,376
My question is absolutely justified.

572
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:30,834
And yes, please don't shout.

573
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:32,126
I'm showing respect to your age...

574
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,834
Otherwise, I can yell louder than you.

575
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:38,501
Mani... behave yourself,
he's my father okay.

576
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:42,792
Hey... won't take me a
minute to set you straight.

577
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:44,459
Lower your eyes.

578
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:47,084
Mani, this is no way
to talk to the groom's family.

579
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:51,376
He's your future brother-in-law.
- What brother-in-law?

580
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:52,667
We haven't said yes...

581
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:55,834
Mani, you children are taking
this in the wrong direction.

582
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:59,126
You want me to let my sister marry
a drug addict. - Hold on... please...

583
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:02,834
Please-please-please...

584
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:05,417
Uncle wants to say something.
Please go ahead, uncle.

585
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,334
Sister-in-law...
- Yes.

586
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:09,709
Forgive me.

587
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,626
We don't want any kind
of relationship with such people.

588
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:15,751
Sandhu sir... what are you saying?

589
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:18,126
Hey... What do you
mean by 'such people'?

590
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,626
Baldev...
- Brother-in-law.

591
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,126
So... what did you
mean by 'such people'?

592
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:25,709
People like you...

593
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,792
...who don't have any manners?

594
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:33,376
I see... and your son's
very well behaved, isn't he?

595
00:35:33,626 --> 00:35:34,417
Shameless...

596
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,917
Ballu, enough... stop it.
- What are you?

597
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:39,709
What are you?

598
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,459
Are you going to teach us manners?

599
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,876
Nonsense...

600
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:46,667
People like you...
wait over a month...

601
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,209
...for an appointment with me.

602
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:52,459
customers wait outside
my restaurant for over an hour.

603
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:55,334
Purani Haveli is famous
all over Chandigarh.

604
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:56,667
Purabi Haveli...

605
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:59,251
Sounds like the name
of some old horror film.

606
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:03,209
Beware... don't you dare
insult my business! Understand!

607
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:06,001
Do you know what we
call businessmen like you?

608
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,584
Hawkers!
- Sandhu.

609
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,917
Someone shut up that dog.

610
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:14,292
Sandhu sir, what are you saying?

611
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:17,542
Dog and all... it's appalling.

612
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:18,667
I would've left.

613
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:22,501
He's talking about shutting
up that dog. - Yeah!

614
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:28,417
Have you lost your mind, Kartar?
- Sorry, sister...

615
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:31,334
I thought...
- What did you think?

616
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:36,334
Who can dare to call me a dog?

617
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:41,001
Anyone who calls me a dog is a dog himself.
- Baldev!

618
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:44,542
Sister-in-law... take him away.

619
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:45,584
Sandhu sir.

620
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:46,876
Or there's no telling
what will happen here.

621
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,209
What will happen?

622
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,459
Will you seize our passports...

623
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,917
...or have us thrown behind bars.

624
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:54,167
Baldev, be quiet.

625
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:56,584
Did you come out here to build
a relationship or create a scene?

626
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,709
Blurting nonsense...

627
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,417
No respect for your
brother-in-law or your sister.

628
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,084
Apologize.

629
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,542
Sister, you want me to apologize.

630
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:11,167
Baldev...come,
apologize to Sandhu sir.

631
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,251
I said apologize.

632
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,834
Come, Charan. Come on.
- Don't go, Baldev.

633
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:24,167
I said don't go, Baldev.
- Uncle...

634
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:26,376
If you humiliate me...
- Baldev, Wait..

635
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:28,584
Wait, brother, I am coming too.
- Baldev...

636
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:31,209
Take me along too... I'm coming too.

637
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:32,667
Brother...
- Sandhu sir.

638
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:11,334
Hello.
- Hello, brother-in-law.

639
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:12,626
Yeah, Kuldeep.

640
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,167
Did you go see the girl?

641
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,709
Did charan like her?

642
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:20,334
Hello... Brother-in-law?

643
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:23,834
Hello.

644
00:38:24,376 --> 00:38:26,501
Hello. Hello, sister-in-law.

645
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,667
Did you get the soil?
- Yes, I did.

646
00:38:29,459 --> 00:38:30,917
But you didn't send
any pickles this time.

647
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:34,292
I will bring it along when I come
for the wedding. - Great...

648
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:36,584
Uncle, what you are doing?

649
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:39,626
Hello. What happened?

650
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,292
Yes, mom.
- Hello, son.

651
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:45,584
How's the girl? Did you like her?

652
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:50,084
Hello... charan?

653
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:52,584
Hello.

654
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:59,126
Hello. - What's wrong?
Why isn't anyone talking?

655
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,417
Kuldeep, I'll call you later.

656
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:03,667
Why later? Tell her now.

657
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:05,751
How you humiliated us.

658
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:07,667
Did I humiliate you?

659
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:10,334
And you didn't see what they did?

660
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:13,542
You were asking me to apologize...

661
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,334
...and you didn't say
a word to them, sister.

662
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:16,959
We would if it had been their fault.

663
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,792
No...why would it be their fault?

664
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:20,417
They are big people after all.

665
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:21,792
I am the hawker!

666
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,667
Did you buy a stall out there?

667
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:24,626
What?

668
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:26,542
Karan's planning to
open a chain of restaurants...

669
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,209
...so why did papa buy a stall?
- Quiet.

670
00:39:28,376 --> 00:39:29,751
Forget it, brother.

671
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:33,251
He'll get married to
whoever is destined for him.

672
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:34,584
You shut up.

673
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,167
Destiny...

674
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,751
First, go find your destiny.

675
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,001
Let it be.

676
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:41,376
Sandhu Sir was right.

677
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:50,626
What was Sandhu sir right about?

678
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:52,292
Father...
- Shut up

679
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:55,834
Brother-in-law, tell me...

680
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:59,209
...what was Sandhu sir right about?

681
00:39:59,251 --> 00:39:59,751
Listen...

682
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:03,042
A pauper can never become a prince.

683
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:04,792
Brother-in-law!
- Lower your voice.

684
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:06,334
I said to lower your voice.

685
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,876
This isn't Punjab, it's my home.

686
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:10,876
I know it's your home.

687
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,584
And I also know you built it...

688
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,167
...because of Sandhu sir's favors.

689
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:19,167
You're indebted to him,
so you go lick his feet.

690
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,417
Baldev!
- Baldev!

691
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,459
Brother's can do anything
for their sister's husband.

692
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:28,917
And you're taunting him...
insulting him.

693
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,709
Trying to intimidate
him... aren't you ashamed?

694
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:34,126
Aunty, please...

695
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:35,417
What please?

696
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:41,084
He was just a kid, when our parents...

697
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:44,334
He never had to ask
for anything twice.

698
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:47,584
I raised your father...like a mother.

699
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:50,876
And he says please...

700
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,376
Mom!

701
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:02,334
Sister...what was my fault?

702
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:05,584
No-no...if's entirely our fault.

703
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,084
You didn't do anything.

704
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:10,376
Now let's see how you get him married.

705
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,542
What do you mean?

706
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:15,709
I mean...

707
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:17,917
You can never find anyone
who can matchup to Binkle.

708
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:20,501
Enough! Enough, sister!

709
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:22,042
What do you think?

710
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:25,417
My son won't get married without you.

711
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:27,709
What's the date today?

712
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,501
What's the date today?

713
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,626
Here, or in India?
- Here.

714
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,084
It's the 25th.
- What?

715
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:35,876
25th...
- 25th...

716
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,626
Next month on the 25th...

717
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:41,042
...I will get charan married!

718
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,667
I swear to God!

719
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:52,001
Oh, God!

720
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:56,251
Mom!

721
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:16,542
Did this get out of hand?

722
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:20,459
I told you...let's think
of a different idea.

723
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:22,917
Lonely...

724
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:26,542
I am Mr. Lonely...

725
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:29,834
I've no body...

726
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:31,459
For my own.

727
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,876
Follow me if you want a drink.

728
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:35,501
Lonely...

729
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:44,792
Nafisa? I can't believe
you have a girlfriend.

730
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:47,751
Why? Am I only fit to be a brother?

731
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:49,792
Good joke. Good joke.

732
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,501
Things got really messy here.

733
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,251
And you're laughing...
you think it's funny.

734
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,917
You know, dad and aunty...
- chill, man.

735
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:58,709
With a temper like that
he's bound to blow his top.

736
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:00,542
What did happen?

737
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:03,834
Everyone spoke loudly
in the heat of the moment.

738
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,084
And now...

739
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,292
Uncle will go meet
aunty while flying back.

740
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:09,876
And they will be back to normal.
The usual "My sister...my brother..."

741
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:12,584
You don't get it.
Papa has challenged aunt...

742
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:14,334
...that he'll get
me married in a month.

743
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:16,542
Relax bro, nothing is going to happen.

744
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:17,584
You don't get it.

745
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:18,959
Looking at papa's mood...

746
00:43:19,084 --> 00:43:21,792
...he'll get me married to the
first girl he sees when he lands.

747
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:23,959
Even better.
The first girl he sees will be Nafisa.

748
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:27,251
Just tell uncle about her, okay.

749
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:28,334
Nafisa...

750
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:30,084
When are you going
to tell him about us?

751
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:32,084
Sweety, let me handle this first.
- Karan...

752
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:34,459
Then I'll bring Uncle straight to your
house to discuss our marriage. - Hello.

753
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:35,334
Where are you? Hello.

754
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,959
Hello. Stop biting your nails.

755
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:39,584
How did you know?

756
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,334
Because I am your elder brother.

757
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:42,542
And you know...

758
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:46,292
I love you the most.
- I know...I know.

759
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:49,084
You love me the most.
- So chill.

760
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:50,501
I'll bring Nafisa to the airport.

761
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:51,917
Just text me her number.

762
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:53,917
Bye...
- Hello... listen...

763
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:56,334
Nafisa at the airport?

764
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:07,334
See you...

765
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:10,584
Where are my glasses, dear?

766
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,751
It's alright, you sit. I'll go get it.

767
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:17,709
Forgive me, aunty.

768
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:21,042
Your father should be apologizing.

769
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:29,792
What happened?

770
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,792
Uncle and aunty are very upset.

771
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:34,876
It as unfair for poor Binkle as well.

772
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:37,334
Poor...

773
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:39,876
What did we do to poor Binkle?

774
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:42,459
In fact,
we're in trouble because of her.

775
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:45,501
What's her fault...
what's her mistake in all this, uncle?

776
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:49,209
Mistake.

777
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:50,959
Mistake.

778
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:04,584
Are you coming or not?

779
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:06,709
Yes.

780
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:18,959
Left without meeting me!

781
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,584
Who's that girl with Karan?

782
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:37,417
Don't know.

783
00:45:39,126 --> 00:45:42,084
Papa, I think I forgot
my handkerchief in the airplane.

784
00:45:42,126 --> 00:45:43,667
I'll go get it.
- Handkerchief... come along!

785
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,459
Stupid.

786
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:48,042
Hello, uncle.
- Bless you.

787
00:45:48,084 --> 00:45:50,834
She is Nafisa.
- Greetings.

788
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:53,751
Hello.

789
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:56,917
Uncle, she's your daughter-in-law...

790
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:01,501
Didn't charan tell you?
charan?

791
00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:07,751
I forgot my handkerchief...
I'll go get it.

792
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:09,292
Is it studded with diamonds?

793
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,876
Uncle, Nafisa is from Punjab.
Malerkotla.

794
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:14,126
She's a lawyer.

795
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:15,376
Let's talk later.

796
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:19,251
Did you get the car or
did you leave it in Malerkotla?

797
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:21,167
I did.

798
00:46:21,876 --> 00:46:23,334
Let's go.
- Come.

799
00:46:27,376 --> 00:46:28,584
What?

800
00:46:38,876 --> 00:46:41,834
So, you didn't come
to London because of Nafisa?

801
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:47,542
No, uncle...
- The entire family thinks I am stupid!

802
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:50,876
I don't say 'chochi' for 'bread'!

803
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,709
No one says that for bread...

804
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:59,376
You fool, I meant I didn't
grow old under the sun.

805
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:01,542
Your mother will be really happy...

806
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:05,959
...to know that her son
is playing love games out here.

807
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:10,001
Uncle, I...
- Love her.

808
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:12,334
You should learn from Charan.

809
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:18,251
One holler...and he can't dare to
say anything instead of 'Yes Father'.

810
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:23,459
Uncle, Nafisa and I...

811
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:28,334
I don't care how old
your relationship is with her.

812
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:32,667
Uncle...
- Quiet, if you say another word, I...

813
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:37,292
I will jump out of this moving car.
- Uncle... - Papa...Papa...

814
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:38,667
Shut up!

815
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:51,667
Your papa thought I was his girlfriend,
and yet you didn't say anything.

816
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:56,251
You're never going
to tell your dad about me...

817
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:58,084
...and I can give that
to you in writing.

818
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:07,834
That's not true, Nafisa, I...
- Then what is it, Charan.

819
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:10,084
Will you please explain me in detail.

820
00:48:10,584 --> 00:48:14,834
I want to tell...
- You know what I think.

821
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,084
You don't want us to get married.

822
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:20,792
This is disgusting.

823
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:24,334
Nafisa...Nafisa...
- You just forget me now.

824
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:26,876
Nafisa, at least listen to me.
Nafisa...

825
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:29,251
Bid her goodbye.

826
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:32,251
And...why didn't you tell uncle?

827
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:34,376
Father would've made
the aircraft land in midair.

828
00:48:34,584 --> 00:48:36,709
I am thinking about
running away from home.

829
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:37,959
End of my troubles.

830
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:41,667
This is life, not some
Olympic race where you've to run.

831
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,542
Have you ever thought about uncle?

832
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:45,126
Get up.

833
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:49,251
Why? - You should've
asked 'why' before getting up.

834
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,584
charan, you're a Jatt.

835
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:54,667
Take God's name and
tell uncle everything.

836
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:59,084
When men dare, God helps.

837
00:49:03,084 --> 00:49:05,126
I treated sister like God.

838
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,334
She even said...

839
00:49:07,584 --> 00:49:10,334
...that I can never find
anyone who'll match up to Binkle.

840
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,667
Isn't Charan her son too?

841
00:49:12,876 --> 00:49:14,709
That's the way she is.

842
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:18,667
Remember, she once gave us
an empty envelope on Baby's birthday.

843
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:20,792
The money fell out
of the open envelope.

844
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,209
You're too much.

845
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:26,167
Hawker... they called me a hawker.

846
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:32,376
Why that...
- Listen...

847
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:33,667
Hey, ice-cream!

848
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,876
People don't buy anything
from hawkers here.

849
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:37,584
If I ever catch you here again...

850
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:39,334
...I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

851
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,626
Please...
- Now get lost!

852
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:44,209
Didn't you hear? Keep moving.
- Listen...

853
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:47,334
I've heard that Binkle
is a really cute girl.

854
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:51,459
Even I like her, but...

855
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:54,917
Father, I've something to say.

856
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,917
She's a nice girl, father.

857
00:49:58,126 --> 00:49:59,709
I was just saying that.

858
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:04,667
She's a nice girl, but her father...

859
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:05,917
Father?

860
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:07,584
When did you meet him?

861
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:13,084
Hey... Do you remember
that we went to London?

862
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:14,209
Yes, I do.

863
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:16,792
Then how could you
forget meeting her father?

864
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,501
No, I was talking
about a different father...

865
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:23,917
That father was abusing me.
This father was getting abused.

866
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:25,876
Which other father
are you talking about?

867
00:50:26,084 --> 00:50:30,251
No, I...
- Son, be honest with me.

868
00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:32,792
Do you do drugs?
- I don't, father.

869
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:35,334
Then why did the Sandhus
call you a druggie?

870
00:50:35,376 --> 00:50:36,876
They must have noticed something!

871
00:50:37,292 --> 00:50:39,751
Okay, tell me how you fell down.

872
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:42,417
Oh, God! Did you fall down?

873
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:44,751
Did you get hurt?
- He fell down two days ago.

874
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:45,876
Can I talk to him now?

875
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,501
But how did he fall down?
- Ask him.

876
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:50,417
Ask him... ask him.

877
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:52,667
What happened?

878
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:56,334
I wasn't getting any signal on
the phone, so... - I don't either...

879
00:50:56,459 --> 00:50:59,042
What should I do?
Should I fall down? Tell me...

880
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:00,542
Should I fall down too?

881
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,376
No signal.

882
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:08,501
Son.
- What a mess.

883
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:12,459
He's definitely a druggie.

884
00:51:12,751 --> 00:51:14,501
He's definitely doing drugs.
- No.

885
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:17,501
Charan can never do such a thing.
- Don't know.

886
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,417
I've already challenged
them for charan's marriage.

887
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:22,626
But fixing him is a challenge as well.

888
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:27,251
You know,
druggies look normal on the outside.

889
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,709
But they are completely
abnormal on the inside.

890
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:35,459
Lord...have mercy.

891
00:51:58,292 --> 00:51:59,584
O Benevolent One...

892
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:01,292
I've everything one can ask for.

893
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:04,792
Fame, fortune, respect...
4000 trucks.

894
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:09,834
All I seek now is a decent
suitor for my daughter.

895
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:11,834
Praise the Lord.

896
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:15,792
Lord, I am grateful.

897
00:52:16,209 --> 00:52:17,376
Help me.

898
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,667
Where did he go?

899
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:25,876
Papa...
- Sir...

900
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:27,042
Yes, dear.

901
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,876
Hello.
- Hello.

902
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:57,292
Papa, please tell
us who are these people.

903
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:59,626
They are really great people.

904
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:02,042
I already made it very clear.

905
00:53:02,376 --> 00:53:04,501
The wedding must happen this month.

906
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:09,584
And what a sweet girl. Proper Sikhni.

907
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:12,459
And not from a different community.

908
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:15,501
Charan.
- Yes.

909
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:18,917
Jwar Nagar. Do you know?
- No, I don't.

910
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:21,417
I do, uncle. Take a right.

911
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:27,834
'I can't find anyone
who will matchup to Binkle.'

912
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:33,917
Kuldeep,
she's a really beautiful girl.

913
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:35,709
You'll see for yourself.

914
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:42,001
Ask someone for directions
to New Market, Mata's Temple.

915
00:53:42,126 --> 00:53:44,667
Take a left. Take the next left.

916
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:48,792
Son...
- Yes.

917
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:51,542
You seem to know a lot in six months.

918
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,209
Does Nafisa live here?

919
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:56,334
No, papa, Nafisa lives in Sector 17.

920
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:03,876
Karan was telling me.

921
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:07,251
Karan, left or right? Left or right?
- Right!

922
00:54:09,584 --> 00:54:12,917
18... 17...

923
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,417
We're here... no. 16.

924
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:16,459
We've arrived.

925
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:21,126
Take it in... yeah, in...

926
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:24,251
We've arrived.

927
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,667
Is it this one with the tractor?
- Why?

928
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:37,251
Don't you like the tractor's color?
- No, it's a great color. Red.

929
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:38,626
Danger...
- Huh!

930
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:39,959
Nothing, let's go.

931
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:50,209
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!

932
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:51,959
Sweety, pick up your phone.

933
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:59,084
"My beloved's come home, O Lord."

934
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:00,876
He's here! He's here! He's here!

935
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:02,709
I hope you didn't have
trouble finding my place.

936
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:06,001
Not at all.
He brought us straight to your home.

937
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:09,626
He's from London but knows
chandigarh better than us.

938
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,584
I see...so the boy's from London.

939
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:16,292
No, Karan is from London. My nephew.

940
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:20,292
My boy's a homegrown lad. Charan.

941
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:22,042
I see... Charan-Karan.

942
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:25,042
They have similar names,
like their face.

943
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:28,084
In fact, you two look
like identical twins.

944
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:31,834
They are identical twins.

945
00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:35,417
I see... very good.

946
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:39,834
I don't see sister-in-law.
- And you never will.

947
00:55:40,084 --> 00:55:43,709
Huh?
- It's God's will after all.

948
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,459
Sorry.

949
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:51,459
Baldev, I can't remember
when I got independence.

950
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:56,459
Actually,
on the 15th of August, she...

951
00:55:57,042 --> 00:56:00,751
You see,
now I am Sweety's mom and dad.

952
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:02,709
But she doesn't listen to anyone.

953
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:05,084
Actually,
there's nothing to hide from you.

954
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:07,417
She has already rejected
12 marriage proposals.

955
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:10,667
Yours is the unlucky no. 13.

956
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:17,792
Sweety dear.

957
00:56:28,876 --> 00:56:30,667
She's really nice.

958
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:33,667
You think she's nice.

959
00:56:33,917 --> 00:56:35,542
You even liked Binkle.

960
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,334
Do you love Nafisa at all?

961
00:56:38,584 --> 00:56:43,917
Is he feeling okay?
- That's what I am trying to find out?

962
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:46,042
Lord, have Mercy on us.

963
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:51,376
She's my sweet,
loveable, the apple of my eye...

964
00:56:51,584 --> 00:56:52,584
Sweety.

965
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:54,917
Hello.
- Hello, dear.

966
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:56,084
Bless you, dear.

967
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:59,626
I am sure your papa must
have told you everything.

968
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:00,792
He's...
- Yes!

969
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,792
Dear, if you would
like to speak with the boy...

970
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:07,584
I mean, if there's something
you want to ask... - No.

971
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:08,917
No, please do.

972
00:57:11,626 --> 00:57:12,751
Let them talk.

973
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:15,459
It's a yes from my side, papa.

974
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:17,751
Really?

975
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:20,459
After all, your choice can't be wrong.

976
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,917
Did you hear? This is unbelievable.

977
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:26,626
She said yes.

978
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:29,876
She has never even bought
shampoo of my choice.

979
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:32,751
And today, she said yes to my choice.

980
00:57:33,376 --> 00:57:34,917
Have some sweets.

981
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:36,792
congratulations. Congratulations.

982
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:39,292
This is unbelievable, Baldev.

983
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:41,667
congratulations to you too.

984
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:42,834
Congratulations.

985
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:49,834
I just realized...
how much you love me, brother.

986
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,292
Since my marriage got fixed,
you're more worried than I am.

987
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:55,751
Yeah... I am really tensed.

988
00:57:56,001 --> 00:57:58,334
You know what...run away.

989
00:57:58,917 --> 00:57:59,876
Run away?

990
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,667
But you were saying
that I shouldn't run away.

991
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:05,334
Run away now.
- What are you saying?

992
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:06,667
What else can I say?

993
00:58:06,834 --> 00:58:08,209
Uncle's never going to say yes...

994
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,459
...and, you're never
going to tell him.

995
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,584
There's no other choice.
- No, I won't run away.

996
00:58:11,626 --> 00:58:12,709
You were right yesterday.

997
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:15,376
Then go...tell uncle about Nafisa.

998
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:17,542
I will when the time is right.

999
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:18,959
Tell him on your wedding day.

1000
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:21,001
"Uncle, I like a girl... Nafisa!"

1001
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:22,251
"I love her a lot."

1002
00:58:22,334 --> 00:58:23,292
"With your permission..."

1003
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,792
"...can we head to her home instead."

1004
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:25,751
Duffer!

1005
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:32,542
Isn't that her? Sweety.

1006
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:42,459
Don't hit me. Let's talk first...

1007
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:44,501
Sweety, listen to me.

1008
00:58:44,751 --> 00:58:46,459
Sweety, listen to me.

1009
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:48,417
Sweety... listen to me.
- Have you lost your mind?

1010
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:50,501
That hurts... Sweety, that hurts.

1011
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,667
Sweety, listen to me...
- What are you?

1012
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:54,126
You came over to
my house with your uncle...

1013
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,834
...with a marriage proposal
for your brother.

1014
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:57,542
I didn't know that was your house.

1015
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,751
I only realized when
I saw the red tractor.

1016
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:01,459
I even tried calling you...
but you don't even answer my call.

1017
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:02,792
I...
- No, please...don't...

1018
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:05,042
Beat him... give him a few
blows on my behalf too, Sweety.

1019
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,334
He's so shameless.
Now I get the entire story.

1020
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:08,459
Listen to him first.

1021
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:10,792
Now I know what he's been
doing here for the last six months.

1022
00:59:11,084 --> 00:59:13,126
"When men dare, even God helps."

1023
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:15,792
Now you run, son.

1024
00:59:15,959 --> 00:59:19,584
Sweety, I think you
should go tell your dad...

1025
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:21,042
My father!

1026
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,667
First time in my life
I have listened to him.

1027
00:59:23,834 --> 00:59:26,751
He's so happy...like that
smile's stuck to his face.

1028
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:29,584
And you want me to
take that away from him.

1029
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:32,292
Karan, I think you
should do something.

1030
00:59:32,376 --> 00:59:34,376
Hey, keep your opinion
to yourself, okay.

1031
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:37,334
Please, help us, Sweety.
- I can't do anything.

1032
00:59:37,459 --> 00:59:39,084
Now you must do something,
otherwise...

1033
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:40,501
Otherwise...

1034
00:59:41,376 --> 00:59:42,542
Otherwise what?

1035
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:44,876
Charan is also good.
- What?

1036
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:47,209
What are you saying?
You're his sister-in-law.

1037
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,417
I'll be your sister-in-law
once I'm married to him.

1038
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:51,167
What rubbish? What are you saying?

1039
00:59:51,251 --> 00:59:53,209
Angry young man!

1040
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:54,376
Hey...

1041
00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:57,584
Now you must handle this
situation with the same zest.

1042
00:59:57,626 --> 00:59:58,959
And until this problem isn't solved...

1043
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:00,584
...marriage is not on the cards.

1044
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:03,126
I am not your girlfriend,
and you're not my boyfriend.

1045
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:07,001
You're in big trouble.
- Sweety!

1046
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:30,626
"I am your king..."

1047
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:32,292
"I brought you a ring..."

1048
01:00:32,459 --> 01:00:35,542
"...be my queen today."

1049
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:37,584
"I am gonna propose today."

1050
01:00:37,626 --> 01:00:39,209
"Praise you every day."

1051
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:42,334
"can't say how beautiful you are."

1052
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:45,626
"Get lost...don't lock horns in love."

1053
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:49,501
"Bury your feelings in your heart."

1054
01:00:52,626 --> 01:00:56,334
"O breeze... sweep me away."

1055
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:59,751
"Come...and steal my heart."

1056
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:03,334
"Write my name...on your heart."

1057
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:07,042
"I'm stuck in the middle...
come closer dear."

1058
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:08,584
"Make me your boyfriend."

1059
01:01:08,626 --> 01:01:11,876
"Go woo someone else?
- "Make me your boyfriend."

1060
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:14,001
"Take your eyes off me."

1061
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:15,501
"Trap me in your love.

1062
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,917
"Go woo someone else?
- "Make me your boyfriend."

1063
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:20,834
"Take your eyes off me."

1064
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:30,876
"I am yours...you're mine."

1065
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:34,542
"I am yours...you're
mine...that's for sure."

1066
01:01:34,751 --> 01:01:38,126
"Your hand in mine...that's for sure."

1067
01:01:38,251 --> 01:01:41,584
"Don't stare in my eyes..."

1068
01:01:41,709 --> 01:01:44,876
"...but I am sure to
come in your dreams."

1069
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,626
"Day dreaming all day..."

1070
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:48,292
"...why are you still stuck on me."

1071
01:01:48,376 --> 01:01:52,251
"Better find someone
else to lose your heart."

1072
01:01:55,126 --> 01:01:59,001
"O breeze... sweep me away."

1073
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:02,501
"Come...and steal my heart."

1074
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:05,876
"Write my name...
on the card of love."

1075
01:02:06,001 --> 01:02:09,751
"I'm stuck in the middle...
come closer dear."

1076
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,126
"Make me your boyfriend."

1077
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:14,667
"Go woo someone else?
- "Make me your boyfriend."

1078
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:16,042
"Take your eyes off me."

1079
01:02:16,084 --> 01:02:18,084
"Trap me in your love.

1080
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:21,626
"Go woo someone else?
- "Make me your boyfriend."

1081
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,667
"Take your eyes off me."

1082
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:37,209
"My eyes always dreamt about you."

1083
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:40,751
"I cooked up new ideas to woo you."

1084
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:44,209
"You're the most beautiful...
I keep hitting on you."

1085
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:48,126
"If you talk to me...
I'll be fine again."

1086
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:49,417
"One more time..."

1087
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:52,876
"Love's sweeter than honey...
taste it my sweetheart."

1088
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:56,459
"Your youth's getting wasted slowly."

1089
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:59,917
"I am your king,
baby, why don't you understand."

1090
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:03,876
"If you say yes...
I'll get the wedding band."

1091
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:08,542
"Get lost...
don't lock horns in love."

1092
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:11,876
"Bury your feelings in your heart."

1093
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:19,001
"O breeze... sweep me away."

1094
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:22,417
"Come...and steal my heart."

1095
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:25,959
"Write my name...
on the card of love."

1096
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:29,709
"I haven't locked eyes
yet... come closer dear."

1097
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:31,084
"Make me your boyfriend."

1098
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:34,626
"Go woo someone else?
- "Make me your boyfriend."

1099
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,667
"Take your eyes off me."

1100
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:51,542
"Make me your boyfriend."

1101
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:52,792
"Go woo someone else?

1102
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:54,626
"Make me your boyfriend."

1103
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:55,751
"Take your eyes off me."

1104
01:03:55,876 --> 01:03:57,667
"Trap me in your love.

1105
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,292
"Go woo someone else?

1106
01:03:59,459 --> 01:04:00,834
"Make me your boyfriend."

1107
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:02,792
"Take your eyes off me."

1108
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:20,917
Enjoy your meal.

1109
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:27,667
So Sandhu sir, what is your opinion?

1110
01:04:27,959 --> 01:04:30,376
Paramjeet, I haven't...
- Look, brother...

1111
01:04:31,084 --> 01:04:33,084
If you don't agree to this alliance...

1112
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:35,792
...then we'll be forced to think
that you haven't forgiven us yet.

1113
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,876
Don't embarrass me, sister-in-law.

1114
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:40,917
We always wanted
Binkle to marry Karan.

1115
01:04:41,584 --> 01:04:43,042
You brought that Charan instead.

1116
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:45,751
Forget the past...
just say the word...

1117
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:47,792
...when should we call Karan?
- Yeah...

1118
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:51,167
What do you say, Binkle dear?
- Papa, I...

1119
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:54,126
What will Binkle say?
Karan is better.

1120
01:04:54,834 --> 01:04:56,751
And, he's also 5 minutes
older than Charan.

1121
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:00,709
So, on which date should we fix it?

1122
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:03,042
Well, Christmas is on the 25th, so...

1123
01:05:03,126 --> 01:05:05,792
Is Christmas on the 25th this year?

1124
01:05:08,459 --> 01:05:10,459
You get drunk on the 21st-22nd.

1125
01:05:10,584 --> 01:05:12,501
How would you know when is Christmas?

1126
01:05:12,584 --> 01:05:16,084
As I was saying,
let's set the wedding on the 25th.

1127
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:18,042
It's christmas as well.

1128
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:20,751
Double the celebrations.
- Yes.

1129
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,001
Congratulations.

1130
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:24,542
cheers. Cheers.

1131
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:25,917
congratulations. Congratulations.

1132
01:05:31,459 --> 01:05:32,542
Who is it?

1133
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:35,042
Brother Baldev.

1134
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:37,334
Answer it.

1135
01:05:38,084 --> 01:05:40,376
Hello. Hello.

1136
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:43,542
There's definitely a
network issue in this house.

1137
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:45,584
Hello.

1138
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:51,709
Hello, brother.
- Kartar. Start packing.

1139
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:53,751
charan is getting married.

1140
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,917
charan's marriage? So you agreed?

1141
01:05:58,042 --> 01:05:59,167
What do you mean?

1142
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:03,501
I mean...you don't like them.

1143
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:07,334
Are you crazy?
They are such great people.

1144
01:06:08,376 --> 01:06:10,834
I am really proud of you, brother.
Really proud.

1145
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:12,334
Leave that.

1146
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:14,417
You must get here by 20th-22nd.

1147
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:17,292
The wedding's on the 25th.

1148
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:20,834
25th?

1149
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:23,334
25th is such a lame date, brother.

1150
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:27,126
Fix another date...
like 26th, 27th, 28th.

1151
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:30,917
Kartar, this is about my promise.

1152
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:33,751
I challenged her for the 25th...

1153
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:35,667
...so the wedding will
take place on the 25th.

1154
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:37,542
But it's christmas
in England on the 25th.

1155
01:06:37,584 --> 01:06:38,709
The day of the Lord, brother.

1156
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:41,542
Are you planning on dressing up like
Santa Clause and give out sweets?

1157
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:43,792
Brother...

1158
01:06:46,876 --> 01:06:48,709
Karan's wedding on the 25th as well.

1159
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:52,084
Karat's wedding is also on the 25th.
- Yes, brother.

1160
01:06:55,001 --> 01:06:56,751
But I challenged her for the 25th.

1161
01:06:56,834 --> 01:06:58,834
But Sandhu sir has already
fixed 25th for the wedding.

1162
01:06:58,876 --> 01:07:02,126
I see... so Karan's
marriage has been fixed...

1163
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:04,167
...with Sandhu's daughter Binkle.

1164
01:07:04,876 --> 01:07:08,042
Your mother's doing
this to torment me!

1165
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:13,251
Listen, Kartar,
you have a brother as well.

1166
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:14,917
You're coming here... that's it!

1167
01:07:15,084 --> 01:07:16,126
And if you don't show up...

1168
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:18,376
...then our relationship
is over for good, understand!

1169
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,084
Sister, I...
- Don't even think about it.

1170
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:30,751
Is Baldev now more
important to you than me?

1171
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:33,542
Poor boy's got only one uncle now.

1172
01:07:33,709 --> 01:07:35,459
And even he won't attend the wedding.

1173
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:39,626
You must stay here, end of discussion.

1174
01:07:41,209 --> 01:07:43,792
And if you don't... then
that's the end of this relation.

1175
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:53,334
Why did you call Sweety here, charan?
- Don't get mad at me.

1176
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:54,626
You were in the bathroom...

1177
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,959
...and Sweety was calling you.

1178
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:57,626
I just picked up her
call and gave her an update.

1179
01:07:57,751 --> 01:07:59,209
She's a smart girl, she will help us.

1180
01:07:59,251 --> 01:08:01,459
She won't help us...
she'll beat me to a pulp.

1181
01:08:01,751 --> 01:08:03,626
Everyone's conspiring against me.

1182
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:06,376
The Sandhus threw us out,
uncle gave challenge...

1183
01:08:06,459 --> 01:08:07,959
...and mom-dad fixed my wedding.

1184
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,459
And all this because of you.

1185
01:08:09,584 --> 01:08:12,084
If only you had said yes for Binkle...
- And what about Nafisa.

1186
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:13,376
Make her my sister.

1187
01:08:13,459 --> 01:08:15,876
Don't you have a better example?

1188
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,834
You could've told me about Nafisa.

1189
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:20,667
Duffer. - You didn't tell me
about Sweety, either.

1190
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:24,251
You look so restless.

1191
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,084
Here's your chain.

1192
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:28,709
And anyway...you can't open
a chain of Purani Haveli anymore.

1193
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:31,084
Wait... sorry, man.

1194
01:08:34,334 --> 01:08:35,917
Forget it, don't worry.

1195
01:08:36,126 --> 01:08:37,792
What else should I do?
- Take advice?

1196
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,751
From who?
- Kartar uncle.

1197
01:08:40,209 --> 01:08:41,584
Kartar uncle?

1198
01:08:41,709 --> 01:08:43,376
He'll fix everything.

1199
01:08:43,834 --> 01:08:45,292
Like he fixed things for you.

1200
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:47,126
He made everyone believe
you're a drug addict.

1201
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:49,084
But he solved my problem.

1202
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,751
God, I am in a mess.
- He's a genius.

1203
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:56,292
That man can cook
up an idea from anything.

1204
01:09:00,834 --> 01:09:02,001
Any other option?

1205
01:09:05,626 --> 01:09:07,792
My life's become hell.

1206
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:10,917
Sister's pulling my legs
while brother's pulling my hair.

1207
01:09:11,376 --> 01:09:13,042
They are making new relations...

1208
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:16,792
...and ending their old ties with me.

1209
01:09:17,626 --> 01:09:19,959
What to do, Jolly. What should I do?

1210
01:09:20,209 --> 01:09:24,876
First finish your drink, dude.
- That's right.

1211
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:28,251
Karan's calling on Skype.

1212
01:09:29,251 --> 01:09:31,292
He will definitely help me.
- Of course, he will.

1213
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:34,292
Today's youth, Jolly.
Smart and intelligent.

1214
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:38,626
Karan-Charan...what's up my boys?

1215
01:09:38,834 --> 01:09:42,251
Karan uncle, we're in big trouble.

1216
01:09:42,334 --> 01:09:43,709
Please help us.

1217
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:48,667
Uncle...please come up
with an idea... find a solution.

1218
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:50,626
Just get my wedding canceled.

1219
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:54,917
You fool...I came up
with an idea for charan...

1220
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:56,959
...and our entire family broke up.

1221
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,376
If I come up with another idea...

1222
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:00,167
...then the Sandhus will sc*** me.

1223
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:02,042
Binkle is his daughter...

1224
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:05,876
...not a tennis ball, which you can toss
over to first charan and then Karan.

1225
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:08,792
charan had a reason, Nafisa.

1226
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:10,626
What is your reason? Najma?

1227
01:10:15,876 --> 01:10:17,709
Sweety...please...
- I was only joking.

1228
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:20,084
Kartar uncle is on Skype...
- He felt offended.

1229
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:22,251
Karan...
- I'll close this matter once and for all.

1230
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:24,792
Charan.
- Just meet my uncle Kartar.

1231
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:28,167
Call Karan, he felt bad.

1232
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,834
Hello.
- Hello.

1233
01:10:34,876 --> 01:10:37,542
Uncle, she's...
- I got it.

1234
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:38,917
Greetings, dear.

1235
01:10:38,959 --> 01:10:42,167
Kartar uncle, I am not who you think.

1236
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:43,792
Huh?

1237
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:45,959
I mean I am not Nafisa, I am Supreet.

1238
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:47,792
Sweety.
- Sweety?

1239
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:51,834
My girlfriend?
- No... charan's future wife.

1240
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:53,917
Did Nafisa go on a pilgrimage?

1241
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:55,542
What can I say, uncle Kartar?

1242
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,792
He hasn't told uncle
Baldev about Nafisa yet.

1243
01:10:57,959 --> 01:10:59,542
And of all the people in Chandigarh...

1244
01:10:59,626 --> 01:11:01,417
...uncle had to choose
her for Charan, Sweety.

1245
01:11:01,709 --> 01:11:03,751
Sweety is hard to miss.

1246
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:07,209
curses...
what kind of a family is this?

1247
01:11:07,501 --> 01:11:09,751
No one has any kind of
communication with anyone.

1248
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:11,876
Their families are
fixing their wedding...

1249
01:11:12,126 --> 01:11:13,584
...and these guys have girlfriends.

1250
01:11:13,876 --> 01:11:15,126
While we're getting tensed.

1251
01:11:17,001 --> 01:11:19,667
Are you tensed?
- Of course.

1252
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:25,459
What is this?
- Whiskey?

1253
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:28,542
Brother Baldev.

1254
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:32,626
What is this?
- Definitely not soda.

1255
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:33,959
correct answer.

1256
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:35,667
Sister Jeeto.

1257
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,376
And this is me... Ice.

1258
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,626
Whiskey wants the ice in his glass...

1259
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:42,334
...and soda wants
the ice in his glass.

1260
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:45,709
How can I be in two
places at the same time?

1261
01:11:51,834 --> 01:11:55,084
Jolly...what an idea.
- Me?

1262
01:11:55,126 --> 01:11:56,209
Of course...

1263
01:11:56,334 --> 01:11:57,709
I know what you want to say.

1264
01:11:57,917 --> 01:11:59,792
If we mix whiskey with soda...

1265
01:11:59,876 --> 01:12:01,792
...then the ice can
be with both of them.

1266
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:04,751
Isn't it?
- See... genius.

1267
01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:08,751
Like I said...he can come
up with an idea anywhere.

1268
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:10,626
He's so humble too.

1269
01:12:10,876 --> 01:12:13,584
It's his idea but giving
the credit to Jolly.

1270
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:17,876
He's not humble, he's a big jumble.

1271
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,376
He's only giving
credit to Jolly because...

1272
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:23,292
...if things go sideways tomorrow,
he can blame Jolly for it.

1273
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:26,542
I didn't say a word,
and you understood the idea.

1274
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:29,876
Dude, that's my quality.

1275
01:12:30,251 --> 01:12:35,084
And when I keep telling
you to increase my salary...

1276
01:12:35,126 --> 01:12:36,917
...don't you understand that?

1277
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:40,126
There are something's
I don't understand.

1278
01:12:40,751 --> 01:12:44,251
Problem solved... no more worrying.

1279
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:46,251
Call brother Baldev.

1280
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:49,459
Uncle Baldev is at my home,
drinking with papa.

1281
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:57,959
Kartar, did you book a ticket.

1282
01:12:58,001 --> 01:12:59,667
Why did you challenge her...

1283
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,751
...if you wanted to secretly
get Charan married?

1284
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,709
What rubbish?

1285
01:13:03,876 --> 01:13:05,459
Why will it be a secret wedding?

1286
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:08,042
charan's going to have
a grand wedding here.

1287
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:09,667
But who's going to see it there?

1288
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:13,584
Neither sister Jeeto,
nor brother-in-law, nor Sandhu sir.

1289
01:13:13,792 --> 01:13:15,251
So?
- So what?

1290
01:13:15,626 --> 01:13:18,084
Opt for a destination wedding instead,
in London.

1291
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:19,501
London?

1292
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:22,709
Where did you get humiliated?
- In London.

1293
01:13:22,876 --> 01:13:25,542
Where were you called a hawker?
- In London.

1294
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,834
So where should you
show your grandeur?

1295
01:13:27,876 --> 01:13:30,126
London?
- So where should the wedding be?

1296
01:13:30,209 --> 01:13:31,751
But...
- In London.

1297
01:13:32,001 --> 01:13:34,126
Gill Sir is right there...
ask him.

1298
01:13:35,126 --> 01:13:37,751
How do you know Gill sir's right here?

1299
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:41,209
Brother...who else would
you be sitting with?

1300
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,959
Don't think too much, brother.

1301
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:45,334
You must show sister Jeeto...

1302
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:48,917
...that an honorable man
never forgets his humiliation.

1303
01:13:48,959 --> 01:13:52,042
But in a foreign country...
- Foreign.

1304
01:13:52,334 --> 01:13:54,709
With the grace of God...
you have a home...

1305
01:13:54,959 --> 01:13:58,834
...your Kartar...
your Jolly...your Mini Punjab.

1306
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,334
Bring everyone along.
Bring entire Punjab.

1307
01:14:01,459 --> 01:14:03,376
It's your London.
- Yeah...

1308
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:06,501
But so many people...
so much work.

1309
01:14:06,584 --> 01:14:08,876
London will be very expensive.

1310
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:11,751
It will be expensive,
but people will talk too.

1311
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:14,459
You were insulted in London...

1312
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:16,667
...so, the wedding should
take place there too.

1313
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,542
Don't worry... with the grace of God,
I'm blessed with quite a lot.

1314
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:23,209
But the Sandhus have everything.

1315
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,709
Doesn't matter...
we'll deal with it.

1316
01:14:25,876 --> 01:14:27,751
I've 400 tractors,
when will they come in handy?

1317
01:14:27,959 --> 01:14:29,834
I've only one daughter.

1318
01:14:29,876 --> 01:14:31,626
Don't worry...we'll manage.

1319
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:36,751
So Kartar, it's final.

1320
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:40,376
Destination Wedding, in London.

1321
01:14:40,501 --> 01:14:41,834
That's more like it.

1322
01:14:42,084 --> 01:14:44,167
Goodbye.

1323
01:14:45,876 --> 01:14:48,417
Well...my problem is solved.

1324
01:14:49,417 --> 01:14:50,917
What about our problem?

1325
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:54,917
You fools...what does the
air-hostess tell us in the flight?

1326
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:59,001
Wear your oxygen mask
before helping others.

1327
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:01,584
If I'm out of breath myself...

1328
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:03,376
...who's going to help
you wear the oxygen mask?

1329
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:05,626
When are you going to help
us wear the mask? After we're dead?

1330
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:08,876
If we come over to London for
the wedding, then she will kill me.

1331
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:10,292
And Nafisa will strangle me.

1332
01:15:10,334 --> 01:15:12,834
And you'll lose...
- Both your nephews.

1333
01:15:12,959 --> 01:15:16,251
Oh man...I thought
my problem was large.

1334
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:18,542
But your problem is larger than life.

1335
01:15:18,626 --> 01:15:19,876
We'll see what to do.

1336
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:21,126
Just come to London.

1337
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:50,001
The flight has landed,
but Karan hasn't come out yet.

1338
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:52,501
Isn't this unbelievable, sister?
- It's landed.

1339
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:54,834
The entire family
is here to welcome Karan.

1340
01:15:55,626 --> 01:15:58,459
But only I am here to welcome the
entire family coming from Punjab.

1341
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:00,084
That's what I am asking you?

1342
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:02,876
Why is Baldev getting
charan married in London?

1343
01:16:03,376 --> 01:16:04,709
Destination Wedding, sister!

1344
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:06,834
You know, like the snooty white people.

1345
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:08,459
It was his idea.

1346
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:10,209
Stupid!

1347
01:16:12,126 --> 01:16:14,417
They are here.
- Look...my son has arrived.

1348
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:16,876
Karan!

1349
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:24,126
Where's Kartar?
I don't see anyone.

1350
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,459
Hi, my boy...

1351
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:33,167
Your joys will be
pretty short-lived...

1352
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:35,959
...if you don't sort out all this son.

1353
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:38,251
Mum...

1354
01:16:38,626 --> 01:16:41,501
Looking good, uncle Kartar.
Fresh... Fit!

1355
01:16:42,626 --> 01:16:43,584
Hi!

1356
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:48,084
Kartar. Give me a hug.
- Welcome to London, brother.

1357
01:16:48,126 --> 01:16:49,084
Greetings.

1358
01:16:49,126 --> 01:16:51,501
How are you, Binkle?
- Manni, how are you?

1359
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:53,709
Bro, how are you?
- Yeah, let's go.

1360
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:55,001
come on....
- come on.

1361
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:57,126
Uncle Kartar.

1362
01:16:59,376 --> 01:17:00,834
Is charan getting married to her?

1363
01:17:01,167 --> 01:17:03,251
You have a great memory, mom.

1364
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:04,751
Yes-Yes... Yes!

1365
01:17:05,084 --> 01:17:05,834
Oh, my...

1366
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,876
Sweety, greet your uncle too.

1367
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:09,334
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1368
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:10,876
She is characterless.

1369
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:12,584
Characterless?
- Hmmmm

1370
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:14,584
She has a boyfriend too.

1371
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:16,459
Poor Charan is trapped.

1372
01:17:17,459 --> 01:17:18,501
Sister Jeeto...

1373
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,792
Can I go meet her?
- Yes...

1374
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:22,709
Come, let's go meet your aunt.
- Go on...

1375
01:17:22,751 --> 01:17:24,959
come, Sweety.
- Yes...

1376
01:17:25,292 --> 01:17:28,501
Mr. Gill,
at least someone stay with me.

1377
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:29,876
Am I going to stay alone?

1378
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:31,417
I get it...

1379
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:33,709
Is it them we're not speaking with?

1380
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:35,417
Yes.
- Indeed... Indeed, brother.

1381
01:17:35,459 --> 01:17:37,042
Kuldeep. All okay?

1382
01:17:50,459 --> 01:17:51,876
Greetings.
- Bless you, son.

1383
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,917
And she's your new
daughter-in-law... Sweety.

1384
01:17:54,126 --> 01:17:55,167
Hello.

1385
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:00,376
Let's go now?

1386
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:01,876
Are you planning
on settling down here?

1387
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:02,584
Let's go.

1388
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:03,959
Okay...okay.

1389
01:18:04,001 --> 01:18:05,834
come, dear.

1390
01:18:05,876 --> 01:18:07,626
Bye.
- Bye, see you later.

1391
01:18:07,667 --> 01:18:09,251
Bye.
- We were just talking.

1392
01:18:09,376 --> 01:18:11,917
Are you still angry, aunty?

1393
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:13,834
Aunty?

1394
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:16,334
Aunty, who?
- You?

1395
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:19,042
I'm an old lady.
- No-no-no...

1396
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,167
No-no-no?

1397
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:22,667
Oh yes, little baby.

1398
01:18:23,209 --> 01:18:26,001
Oh my...baby, did you fall down?

1399
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,542
She even remembers the dialogue.

1400
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:33,167
Yeah... dad wanted to come,
but he was busy.

1401
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:35,959
Really, man, he as busy.

1402
01:18:38,251 --> 01:18:39,542
It was my mistake.

1403
01:18:39,667 --> 01:18:42,334
What is Sweety doing there?
Call her.

1404
01:18:45,792 --> 01:18:47,542
Charan!
- charan!

1405
01:18:47,584 --> 01:18:50,751
Yeah... Yes...
- Where are you lost?

1406
01:18:51,251 --> 01:18:52,209
Jet lag.

1407
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:53,501
Lord...

1408
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:55,459
Brother's saying call Sweety here.

1409
01:18:58,251 --> 01:18:59,334
Call her.

1410
01:19:00,084 --> 01:19:01,334
Sweety.

1411
01:19:06,376 --> 01:19:07,042
Sweety!

1412
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:08,334
Sweety, dear.

1413
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:09,501
Sweety, dear.

1414
01:19:09,584 --> 01:19:10,459
Sweety!

1415
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:14,084
Everyone makes mistakes.
- Sweety, come on, let's go.

1416
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:16,667
It was just a mistake.
- Sweety...

1417
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:20,542
They are calling you, please go.

1418
01:19:20,876 --> 01:19:21,876
I heard it.

1419
01:19:26,626 --> 01:19:27,917
What an ill-mannered girl.

1420
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:36,084
It's a really grand hotel.

1421
01:19:36,167 --> 01:19:37,959
The rooms are even better.

1422
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:39,667
And we've booked
a penthouse for Sweety

1423
01:19:39,792 --> 01:19:40,917
I see...
Very good...

1424
01:19:41,084 --> 01:19:43,459
You see, we must show our enemies...

1425
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:45,001
...that Mr.
Gill is not some ordinary guy.

1426
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:47,417
Absolutely right.
- Any problem, Mr. Gill?

1427
01:19:47,626 --> 01:19:51,251
Not at all. I must book tickets for
my relatives coming from Punjab.

1428
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,417
Don't worry...I'll get
it done on Make My Trip.

1429
01:19:53,584 --> 01:19:55,459
I see...
- Please give me your card?

1430
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,376
The card is the real problem.

1431
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,917
We'll have to get new ones made
because of this destination wedding.

1432
01:20:00,084 --> 01:20:02,542
Papa, he's asking for your credit card.
- Credit card?

1433
01:20:02,584 --> 01:20:05,501
I need to pay them as well.
- Oh...I see.

1434
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:07,834
Here you go.
- Thank you.

1435
01:20:08,001 --> 01:20:10,584
It's too grand even for my taste.
- Jolly, don't just stand there.

1436
01:20:11,126 --> 01:20:12,042
Take everyone inside.

1437
01:20:12,084 --> 01:20:13,417
Shall we?
- Let's go. Come on...

1438
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:34,584
Come, brother.

1439
01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:37,334
come, my Lad,
Kartar Villa welcomes you.

1440
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:49,876
Wow!

1441
01:20:59,126 --> 01:21:09,125
"I am not good. No one is bad."

1442
01:21:13,876 --> 01:21:23,042
"I am not good. No one is bad."

1443
01:21:26,126 --> 01:21:35,251
"Prays Nanak, He alone saves us!"

1444
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:49,167
"Prays Nanak, He alone saves us!"

1445
01:21:49,709 --> 01:21:54,126
"Prays Nanak, He alone saves us!"

1446
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:58,251
Bro...both the parties
are giving pretty angry looks.

1447
01:21:58,334 --> 01:22:02,292
Jolly, take anything you get
in the House of Lord as His blessings.

1448
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:06,334
"No one is bad."

1449
01:22:06,376 --> 01:22:08,167
25th... 25th...

1450
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:09,834
The hall's been already
booked for the 25th.

1451
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:10,626
Please do something.

1452
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:13,126
I can give you a booking
for 24th or the 26th.

1453
01:22:13,334 --> 01:22:15,626
24th...
- What are you saying?

1454
01:22:16,376 --> 01:22:17,417
How can the 25th be booked?

1455
01:22:17,459 --> 01:22:20,459
I already spoke with the priest.
- Yeah...

1456
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:23,626
Words just don't cut it, Mr. Gill.

1457
01:22:23,876 --> 01:22:26,542
I think we should go
and book a music band as well.

1458
01:22:26,751 --> 01:22:29,126
The deal's sealed only
when you have a receipt.

1459
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:30,542
Kartar, tell him...

1460
01:22:30,917 --> 01:22:32,584
...to book a different Gurdwara.

1461
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:36,459
Brother, get your booking
done in a different Gurdwara.

1462
01:22:37,959 --> 01:22:38,876
Reason?

1463
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:40,584
Reason?

1464
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:42,959
Reason? We're older...
he's younger to us.

1465
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:45,917
Sister is older...than you.

1466
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:48,501
No one's big or small
in the Lord's House.

1467
01:22:48,959 --> 01:22:51,251
But one must always
respect their elders.

1468
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:53,417
Look Baldev...

1469
01:22:53,459 --> 01:22:54,667
Just a minute, mister...

1470
01:22:54,876 --> 01:22:55,459
Madam...

1471
01:22:55,751 --> 01:22:58,209
Please don't break the
sanctity of the Gurdwara.

1472
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:01,001
With your permission...

1473
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:04,584
...we can have both the weddings
on the same day, on the 25th.

1474
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:06,084
11 o'clock is fine.

1475
01:23:06,126 --> 01:23:07,709
What an incredible idea?

1476
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:10,751
Same date...same place...
and the same family.

1477
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:11,959
That solves the problem.

1478
01:23:12,084 --> 01:23:13,334
You'll get us in trouble, uncle.

1479
01:23:13,417 --> 01:23:14,459
Is that fine?

1480
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:18,626
You and your ideas?

1481
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:23,542
Okay...

1482
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:25,584
Okay?

1483
01:23:27,667 --> 01:23:30,459
It's all settled now...thank you.
- Goodbye.

1484
01:23:33,376 --> 01:23:34,334
Swee...

1485
01:23:35,876 --> 01:23:37,917
I'll have to cajole her again.

1486
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:41,917
It was the same date...

1487
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:45,001
Now, uncle Kartar has fixed
the same place and time.

1488
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:47,042
And we're depending on him?

1489
01:23:47,251 --> 01:23:49,959
I don't think your so called 'talented,
Kartar uncle can do anything.

1490
01:23:50,001 --> 01:23:51,251
Now, he can... he can...

1491
01:23:51,959 --> 01:23:53,209
You can, can't you?

1492
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:56,501
Uncle, only you can
save their love now.

1493
01:23:56,709 --> 01:23:58,876
Why don't you talk to aunt now?

1494
01:23:59,084 --> 01:24:00,834
Yes.
- Baby dear...

1495
01:24:01,209 --> 01:24:03,709
...sister Jeeto severed
ties with her own brother...

1496
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:05,792
...because of Sandhu sir.

1497
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:07,417
With his father.

1498
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,501
If I tell her about
Karan and Sweety...

1499
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:11,251
Then she will shoot Sweety.

1500
01:24:11,376 --> 01:24:12,376
Bang...

1501
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:13,584
Loose character...

1502
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:17,876
Uncle, why don't you talk to dad?

1503
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:20,251
Then your secret
will be out of the bag.

1504
01:24:20,376 --> 01:24:22,792
Then Nafisa will get
involved... Akbar, Mughlai...

1505
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:25,042
Swords will be drawn...
there will be bloodshed.

1506
01:24:25,251 --> 01:24:29,292
You know what...
shoot these old folks.

1507
01:24:29,751 --> 01:24:32,084
Let's keep this between us.
The youth.

1508
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:35,459
Youth?
- Then think of something.

1509
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:38,626
Think what?

1510
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:44,167
I got an idea.

1511
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:46,459
come, boys and girls, come...

1512
01:24:46,626 --> 01:24:48,417
Why is he taking us
to the vegetable market now?

1513
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:50,126
Come on...
- Hurry up.

1514
01:24:55,084 --> 01:24:56,167
What is this?

1515
01:24:58,042 --> 01:25:02,167
Radish? - It's a radish...
but, not an ordinary one.

1516
01:25:02,584 --> 01:25:05,126
Because...this is Binkle.

1517
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:06,542
Binkle.

1518
01:25:07,292 --> 01:25:08,751
And this one?
- Potatoes.

1519
01:25:09,792 --> 01:25:10,917
This is you.

1520
01:25:12,959 --> 01:25:15,584
And this is sweet potatoes...
which is you.

1521
01:25:16,626 --> 01:25:19,542
My favorite vegetable...
what is this?

1522
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:20,751
Is that me?

1523
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:23,792
No... this is a cauliflower.

1524
01:25:24,459 --> 01:25:25,167
Oh...

1525
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:28,209
The potato will try
to convince radish...

1526
01:25:28,626 --> 01:25:33,042
...to tell her dad she doesn't
want to marry sweet potato.

1527
01:25:33,292 --> 01:25:36,917
Reason... because sweet-potato
is seeing cauliflower.

1528
01:25:37,709 --> 01:25:39,709
Then the cauliflower
will tell her dear watermelon...

1529
01:25:40,376 --> 01:25:41,792
I mean, she will tell Gill sir...

1530
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:44,209
...that I don't want to marry potato.

1531
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:49,084
Reason... because the
potato is a drug addict.

1532
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:52,209
Sweet potato was already free...

1533
01:25:52,376 --> 01:25:53,751
Now cauliflower will be free too.

1534
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:55,917
They will get busy
with each other. Simple.

1535
01:25:56,334 --> 01:25:58,334
Uncle...mind-blowing idea.

1536
01:25:58,751 --> 01:26:00,209
And I am sure you've also thought...

1537
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:03,334
...where I will meet radish...
I mean Binkle.

1538
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:05,751
Of course my boy, of course.

1539
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:08,542
After all, I am a... Punjabi!

1540
01:26:23,709 --> 01:26:24,751
Wow!
- That's the one.

1541
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:26,709
Hey look, it's beautiful.
- Look at that.

1542
01:26:26,751 --> 01:26:28,126
Isn't it nice?

1543
01:26:30,334 --> 01:26:31,792
And look at this one.
- Yes...

1544
01:26:33,126 --> 01:26:34,209
What do you say?
- Yes...

1545
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:35,792
Binkle, have a look.

1546
01:26:36,084 --> 01:26:38,501
What do you say to that one?
- It's really nice.

1547
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:39,459
Yeah.

1548
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:41,084
May be...

1549
01:26:42,251 --> 01:26:43,667
Anyway, let's go have a look...
- What about that?

1550
01:26:43,709 --> 01:26:46,542
Let's go inside...
- I... I'll be back from the washroom.

1551
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:47,626
It's that way.

1552
01:26:50,876 --> 01:26:53,084
Why did you bring me here?
- Why?

1553
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,792
This is where I had that
argument with your... mother.

1554
01:26:57,834 --> 01:26:59,459
I've some bitter
memories with this mall.

1555
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:01,876
Forget it, Sweety.

1556
01:27:02,792 --> 01:27:04,376
I had to talk to you.

1557
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:07,376
Tell me...
- No...not here.

1558
01:27:07,542 --> 01:27:10,376
Let's go up...to the coffee shop?
- Sure.

1559
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:24,542
Are you crazy?
Are you blind?

1560
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:26,334
Have patience.

1561
01:27:27,667 --> 01:27:29,626
Hello.
- Hello.

1562
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:31,084
I'll be right back.

1563
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:36,709
I am terribly sorry for...everything
that happened at your home that day.

1564
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:40,501
Even I am sorry.
Manpreet actually said too much.

1565
01:27:41,417 --> 01:27:45,917
I see... so that's why
I get this 'Coffee with charan'.

1566
01:27:47,501 --> 01:27:51,792
No, actually...
I wanted to show you this.

1567
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:55,917
Papa!

1568
01:27:58,834 --> 01:28:00,792
Is this what you wanted to show me?
- No...no...

1569
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:20,501
Run! Run! Run! Run!

1570
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:28,001
Where is Binkle?

1571
01:28:28,042 --> 01:28:29,376
Call her.
- That way! That way.

1572
01:28:29,542 --> 01:28:30,417
I don't know where she is.

1573
01:28:37,209 --> 01:28:38,376
That way! come on.

1574
01:28:38,792 --> 01:28:41,792
Kartar, this looks like the
most expensive section of the mall.

1575
01:28:41,834 --> 01:28:44,126
Yeah...but there's a sale everywhere.

1576
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:47,126
That shop looks perfect,
give me your card.

1577
01:28:47,876 --> 01:28:48,751
Yeah.

1578
01:28:51,334 --> 01:28:52,709
Stupid!
- Sweety...

1579
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:54,334
You left me alone.

1580
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:02,459
Sorry...
- What?

1581
01:29:02,501 --> 01:29:04,376
Come on...
- What Sweety?

1582
01:29:04,959 --> 01:29:06,501
This is what I wanted to show you.

1583
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:15,167
Karan, your future husband,
and Sweety, my future wife...

1584
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:17,501
It's all a mess, Binkle.

1585
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:21,126
Please, say no to this wedding.

1586
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:26,042
Maybe something's wrong with me.

1587
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:28,417
Don't say that.

1588
01:29:29,376 --> 01:29:30,667
You're really very nice.

1589
01:29:32,126 --> 01:29:36,751
No... I mean,
you'll get many more proposals.

1590
01:29:37,709 --> 01:29:41,209
After getting rejected twice...
from the same family?

1591
01:29:42,792 --> 01:29:43,751
I know you'll handle...

1592
01:29:43,876 --> 01:29:47,459
If Karan doesn't want to get married,
let him say no.

1593
01:29:50,042 --> 01:29:51,042
I wish we could say no...

1594
01:29:51,084 --> 01:29:54,084
...then things wouldn't
have been the way they are.

1595
01:29:55,542 --> 01:29:58,209
But charan, it's their problem...

1596
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:00,542
...why are we getting involved?

1597
01:30:05,126 --> 01:30:06,251
Sweety...

1598
01:30:08,376 --> 01:30:10,126
Now I've put my faith in God's hand.

1599
01:30:12,209 --> 01:30:13,834
Whatever the Lord decides for me...

1600
01:30:14,584 --> 01:30:15,876
...will be good enough for me.

1601
01:30:17,584 --> 01:30:19,417
He's the One who
makes matches in Heaven.

1602
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,834
I am sure...
He's chosen someone for me too.

1603
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:28,209
Anyway...

1604
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:36,834
Charan, I can't explain it, but...

1605
01:30:37,959 --> 01:30:42,751
...I thought maybe you came
here to say something else.

1606
01:30:55,667 --> 01:31:00,417
"We were holding hands but..."

1607
01:31:01,334 --> 01:31:06,584
"...our destinies were far away."

1608
01:31:07,209 --> 01:31:12,709
"Was it our fate that separated us..."

1609
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:18,501
"...or is this the fate of love?

1610
01:31:19,126 --> 01:31:24,709
"I haven't lost you
yet... nor are you with me."

1611
01:31:24,959 --> 01:31:28,792
"So why do I still miss you?"

1612
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:43,000
"Without you...
it's even hard to breathe."

1613
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:49,334
"Because...I can't stop
thinking about you."

1614
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:55,209
"Your memories keep tormenting me."

1615
01:31:55,251 --> 01:32:00,917
"Because...I can't stop
thinking about you."

1616
01:32:01,167 --> 01:32:07,834
"Your memories keep tormenting me."

1617
01:32:20,626 --> 01:32:25,334
"You're right in front of me..."

1618
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:31,584
"...yet we're miles apart."

1619
01:32:32,126 --> 01:32:37,709
"The heart has lots to say..."

1620
01:32:38,042 --> 01:32:42,667
"....but unfortunately
my lips are sealed."

1621
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:46,751
"Whether you were
akin or a stranger..."

1622
01:32:46,876 --> 01:32:49,417
"...the heart couldn't discriminate."

1623
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:53,959
"Why does my heart
keep skipping a beat."

1624
01:32:57,792 --> 01:33:07,791
"Without you...
it's even hard to breathe."

1625
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:14,209
"Because...I can't stop
thinking about you."

1626
01:33:14,376 --> 01:33:20,084
"Your memories keep tormenting me."

1627
01:33:20,126 --> 01:33:25,834
"Because...I can't stop
thinking about you."

1628
01:33:26,042 --> 01:33:31,751
"Your memories keep tormenting me."

1629
01:33:52,959 --> 01:33:55,792
Are your radish,
carrots, and potatoes cooked yet?

1630
01:33:56,417 --> 01:33:57,501
carrots?

1631
01:33:58,626 --> 01:34:00,167
There was no carrot in the plan ever!

1632
01:34:02,334 --> 01:34:05,251
Uncle...Charan claims you're a genius.

1633
01:34:05,959 --> 01:34:07,042
That I am.

1634
01:34:07,209 --> 01:34:09,751
So think of a new idea, please.

1635
01:34:15,126 --> 01:34:16,292
I got it...

1636
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:20,626
This is Binkle...and
she's going to melt.

1637
01:34:21,084 --> 01:34:23,251
This isn't Binkle...and
never should be!

1638
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:25,376
Oh, God...fine...
this is Binkle.

1639
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:27,542
Now! - What now?

1640
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:29,501
Let's target her.
- Why?

1641
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:33,167
This is our problem... why are
you dragging that poor soul in this?

1642
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:35,709
Poor? She's Sandhu sir's daughter.

1643
01:34:37,126 --> 01:34:39,334
Uncle...you got my wedding
canceled with her...

1644
01:34:39,584 --> 01:34:41,334
...and now, we're canceling
Karan's wedding with her too.

1645
01:34:41,376 --> 01:34:42,709
Have you ever wondered
what she's going through?

1646
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:45,042
Are you her uncle? Huh, Charan.

1647
01:34:45,459 --> 01:34:48,751
Do you have a better idea?
Speak up...

1648
01:34:50,542 --> 01:34:52,334
Now I've put my faith in God's hand.

1649
01:34:53,167 --> 01:34:55,334
Whatever the Lord decides
for me...will be good enough for me.

1650
01:34:56,626 --> 01:34:58,667
He's the One who makes
matches in Heaven.

1651
01:34:59,084 --> 01:35:00,042
So be it.

1652
01:35:00,251 --> 01:35:02,626
If he's chosen Sweety for me,
then I am fine.

1653
01:35:02,876 --> 01:35:03,459
What?

1654
01:35:03,709 --> 01:35:06,251
What's he saying, Karan?
- I want to know that too.

1655
01:35:06,626 --> 01:35:08,417
Have you lost your mind?
What are you driveling?

1656
01:35:08,626 --> 01:35:11,459
I am just saying that
one must fight his own battle.

1657
01:35:11,709 --> 01:35:14,042
If Sweety and you
really love each other...

1658
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:15,667
...then fight your own battle.

1659
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:24,959
He took my ice-cream.

1660
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:33,334
Hello, sister?

1661
01:35:37,834 --> 01:35:38,584
Kartar.

1662
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:42,376
Sister...at the crack of dawn?

1663
01:35:42,667 --> 01:35:44,001
Wedding card.

1664
01:35:44,459 --> 01:35:47,042
The first card goes to the uncle.

1665
01:35:48,584 --> 01:35:50,084
Uncle? I see...

1666
01:35:50,209 --> 01:35:55,792
And this too... sweets,
gold chain, diamond ring...

1667
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:59,876
...suit piece and cash too.
- 11,000 Pounds.

1668
01:35:59,917 --> 01:36:01,501
11,000 Pounds?

1669
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:05,001
But sister...these gifts
are given on the wedding day.

1670
01:36:05,084 --> 01:36:06,959
Yes... this is just
the invitation gift.

1671
01:36:07,042 --> 01:36:08,751
From Sandhu sir.

1672
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:11,417
Only for our close relatives.

1673
01:36:16,001 --> 01:36:17,834
Just wait and watch...

1674
01:36:18,126 --> 01:36:20,292
...all the gifts that Sandhu
sir will give on the wedding day.

1675
01:36:20,709 --> 01:36:22,834
Sandhu sir is a really great guy.

1676
01:36:23,459 --> 01:36:26,459
He's so wealthy...but doesn't
have an ounce of arrogance.

1677
01:36:27,001 --> 01:36:28,001
Otherwise, people these days...

1678
01:36:28,042 --> 01:36:32,167
...forget their place after
acquiring little wealth.

1679
01:36:32,209 --> 01:36:34,751
Relationships...
manners, all of it.

1680
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:38,501
Sister... greetings.
- Bless you.

1681
01:36:39,042 --> 01:36:39,626
Greetings.

1682
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:41,834
Kuldeep, this is your invitation card.

1683
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:45,334
Be there...
- You don't have to say it twice.

1684
01:36:45,376 --> 01:36:46,751
We're family after all.

1685
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:48,876
But you must come first...

1686
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:51,751
You see...Charan's engagement
is before Karan's.

1687
01:36:53,834 --> 01:36:54,667
Shall we?
- Yes.

1688
01:36:54,834 --> 01:36:56,542
At least have a cup of tea,
brother-in-law.

1689
01:36:56,959 --> 01:36:58,542
Jolly...
- Yes, bro...

1690
01:36:58,667 --> 01:36:59,751
No, let it be.

1691
01:37:00,126 --> 01:37:02,084
Otherwise,
he'll get another one of his ideas.

1692
01:37:03,626 --> 01:37:05,626
And anyway...we've to
go invite certain people...

1693
01:37:05,709 --> 01:37:07,751
...we don't want to.

1694
01:37:08,667 --> 01:37:10,542
What to do...
that's courtesy after all.

1695
01:37:10,751 --> 01:37:11,834
We must go.

1696
01:37:12,334 --> 01:37:13,667
We'll make it clear...

1697
01:37:13,876 --> 01:37:17,292
come only if you're really
happy...otherwise stay at home.

1698
01:37:24,292 --> 01:37:25,959
And stop asking us for tea...

1699
01:37:26,167 --> 01:37:29,209
Instead, you should be asking
whether you can lend a hand.

1700
01:37:29,584 --> 01:37:30,751
You're my brother after all.

1701
01:37:31,084 --> 01:37:32,334
come home and help me through.

1702
01:37:32,459 --> 01:37:35,876
You see sister, I am divided myself.

1703
01:37:42,459 --> 01:37:44,417
Let's go.
- Yes, come.

1704
01:37:44,834 --> 01:37:46,084
Come, sister.

1705
01:37:52,334 --> 01:37:54,542
"My cute charan...

1706
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:57,042
My naive Charan..."

1707
01:37:57,292 --> 01:38:01,834
"My love's stuck in a cyclone..."

1708
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,626
"...take it across."

1709
01:38:03,876 --> 01:38:07,042
"Take it across now."
- Sorry, are you okay?

1710
01:38:08,667 --> 01:38:11,001
Everyone must fight their own battle.

1711
01:38:11,751 --> 01:38:14,417
But how can a brother
fight with his own brother?

1712
01:38:15,876 --> 01:38:21,751
But my brother has this habit...of
inviting trouble for himself.

1713
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:27,626
Look...here comes the trouble.

1714
01:38:38,376 --> 01:38:39,459
Hi, Nafisa.

1715
01:38:41,751 --> 01:38:42,917
Where is charan?

1716
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:45,709
How about some coffee?

1717
01:38:45,876 --> 01:38:47,334
I'm thirsty for his blood!

1718
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:50,292
Well...that's only possible
at his engagement.

1719
01:38:50,584 --> 01:38:51,542
Come on.

1720
01:38:53,334 --> 01:38:57,042
"O Nafisa.. fiery..."

1721
01:38:57,084 --> 01:39:00,542
"The black thread gets
stuck in the latch."

1722
01:39:00,584 --> 01:39:04,084
"Fights with the sister-in-law,
little brother-in-law is a brat."

1723
01:39:04,167 --> 01:39:07,251
"The black thread gets
stuck in the latch."

1724
01:39:09,709 --> 01:39:11,667
"It's an auspicious night.
With henna clad hands..."

1725
01:39:11,709 --> 01:39:14,001
"You look beautiful tonight."

1726
01:39:14,501 --> 01:39:16,792
"Music plays loud..."
- Card uncle.

1727
01:39:16,834 --> 01:39:18,834
"It's time to dance and shout."

1728
01:39:18,876 --> 01:39:21,001
Sorry, Gill uncle, card.

1729
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:23,584
For making payment?
- Yes.

1730
01:39:24,084 --> 01:39:26,001
"Twelve years..."

1731
01:39:26,501 --> 01:39:28,709
"He'd gone out for 12 years."

1732
01:39:28,834 --> 01:39:30,417
"He brought back powder."

1733
01:39:30,459 --> 01:39:37,709
"When you dance,
my heart beats louder!"

1734
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:43,542
Darling, shall we dance?
- Dance?

1735
01:39:43,584 --> 01:39:45,667
"Maternal uncle dances with wife."

1736
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:48,001
"Paternal aunt dances with her husband."

1737
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:50,501
Sister Jeeto's here.
- "Grandma dances with grandpa."

1738
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:52,792
"Holding a glass in the hand."

1739
01:39:54,376 --> 01:39:55,501
Listen, sister Jeeto's here.

1740
01:39:55,542 --> 01:39:56,792
But not brother-in-law.

1741
01:39:56,876 --> 01:39:59,792
At least our sister's here.
- "Twelve years..."

1742
01:40:00,126 --> 01:40:02,459
"He'd gone out for 12 years."

1743
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:04,251
"He brought back stuff."

1744
01:40:04,334 --> 01:40:12,167
"It will be fun when rocking the
dance floor with uncle."

1745
01:40:16,376 --> 01:40:18,626
coming, Gill sir.
coming.

1746
01:40:41,251 --> 01:40:42,667
Hello.
- Hi...

1747
01:40:43,667 --> 01:40:46,542
I thought I should congratulate you.

1748
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:48,001
Congrats for what...

1749
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:51,251
You know this is just a charade.

1750
01:41:03,792 --> 01:41:05,792
"It's an auspicious night.
With henna clad hands..."

1751
01:41:05,834 --> 01:41:08,167
"You look beautiful tonight."

1752
01:41:08,542 --> 01:41:10,626
"Music plays loud."

1753
01:41:10,667 --> 01:41:12,959
"It's time to dance and shout."

1754
01:41:13,126 --> 01:41:15,792
"This is a joyous occasion..."

1755
01:41:15,834 --> 01:41:18,292
"We've all be been
so eagerly waiting for."

1756
01:41:18,501 --> 01:41:23,167
"He'd gone out for 12 years."

1757
01:41:25,417 --> 01:41:27,709
"He'd gone out for 12 years."

1758
01:41:27,751 --> 01:41:29,626
"He brought back a Harley."

1759
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:33,042
"It will be fun when rocking the
dance floor is the whole family."

1760
01:41:33,209 --> 01:41:36,834
"It will be fun when rocking the
dance floor is the whole family."

1761
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:41,209
"It will be fun when rocking the
dance floor is the whole family."

1762
01:41:41,334 --> 01:41:43,542
Everyone has to fight
their own battle, don't they?

1763
01:41:43,959 --> 01:41:44,709
Go fight...

1764
01:41:45,709 --> 01:41:48,626
"Twelve years..."

1765
01:42:07,167 --> 01:42:08,417
Nafisa.

1766
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:09,792
Nafisa?

1767
01:42:10,126 --> 01:42:11,251
Is she Qureshi?

1768
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:13,959
Nafisa Qureshi. Karan's friend.

1769
01:42:14,042 --> 01:42:16,376
She's from Punjab...
and staying with us.

1770
01:42:16,542 --> 01:42:17,334
I see...

1771
01:42:17,417 --> 01:42:19,417
come, sister...
and bless the children.

1772
01:42:19,626 --> 01:42:21,459
Nafisa Qureshi.

1773
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:22,792
come.

1774
01:42:28,084 --> 01:42:30,042
You're looking so handsome, son.

1775
01:42:31,084 --> 01:42:34,876
You fool...you just
sc*** your own brother.

1776
01:42:35,001 --> 01:42:37,709
Uncle...you know
how much I love music.

1777
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:39,709
I can see that my boy.
I can see that.

1778
01:42:39,876 --> 01:42:42,126
Give the engagement gift.

1779
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:44,876
Easy, tiger, easy.
My poor boy.

1780
01:42:46,459 --> 01:42:48,459
Congratulations.

1781
01:42:48,501 --> 01:42:50,709
Thanks for coming, aunty...
- Thank you.

1782
01:42:50,751 --> 01:42:52,459
May God save you...

1783
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:56,542
Come, let's take a picture together.
Come on.

1784
01:42:57,417 --> 01:42:58,501
Photo.

1785
01:42:59,792 --> 01:43:02,667
Unbelievable Charan,
I never imagined that...

1786
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:04,959
...I'll be a guest in your engagement.

1787
01:43:05,876 --> 01:43:08,167
"He'd gone out for 12 years."

1788
01:43:08,209 --> 01:43:10,167
"He brought back a Harley."

1789
01:43:10,209 --> 01:43:13,626
Smile, please. - "It will be fun when
rocking the dance floor is the whole family."

1790
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:21,292
"It will be fun when rocking the
dance floor is the whole family."

1791
01:43:30,751 --> 01:43:32,126
Kuldeep.
- Yes.

1792
01:43:36,501 --> 01:43:39,292
Hello. - Greetings.

1793
01:44:03,542 --> 01:44:06,501
"I'll talk to my aunt,
introduce you to my mother."

1794
01:44:06,542 --> 01:44:07,792
"Everything will be fine."

1795
01:44:07,959 --> 01:44:09,542
"Is this what you call fine?"

1796
01:44:12,001 --> 01:44:13,376
"Didn't you feel ashamed?"

1797
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:15,876
You didn't even think about me...

1798
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:18,292
...before going ahead and
doing something like this.

1799
01:44:18,459 --> 01:44:21,417
Thanks to Karan for
informing me of time.

1800
01:44:21,709 --> 01:44:23,834
Otherwise, you would've gone
ahead with the wedding as well.

1801
01:44:24,209 --> 01:44:26,209
It's impossible to understand.

1802
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:30,376
Getting engaged to
Sweety was just a plan...

1803
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:35,334
I didn't make any plans this time.

1804
01:44:35,501 --> 01:44:37,126
I swear on the queen.

1805
01:44:39,292 --> 01:44:41,917
What was your plan?
- Well, I thought...

1806
01:44:41,959 --> 01:44:46,292
...if I act casual, then these two
will feel the pressure and run away.

1807
01:44:46,667 --> 01:44:48,209
And that would solve the problem.

1808
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:50,792
That would've solved your problem,
not ours.

1809
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:53,084
Loser!
- You're not the winner too.

1810
01:44:53,251 --> 01:44:54,959
You haven't told your parents either.

1811
01:44:55,042 --> 01:44:56,001
Oh hello...

1812
01:44:56,084 --> 01:44:58,459
At least he didn't get
engaged to his sister-in-law.

1813
01:44:58,667 --> 01:45:00,584
Please ladies, quiet.

1814
01:45:00,751 --> 01:45:02,876
If you guys fight amongst yourselves
then, you'll definitely lose.

1815
01:45:03,084 --> 01:45:04,334
Have team spirit.

1816
01:45:04,834 --> 01:45:06,959
You see in situations like these...

1817
01:45:10,334 --> 01:45:13,792
What is this?
- Uncle, why don't you just tell us?

1818
01:45:13,834 --> 01:45:15,084
But, I am...

1819
01:45:15,376 --> 01:45:18,042
These are shoes...
you're a Singh.

1820
01:45:18,251 --> 01:45:20,584
Wear these...
and run like Milkha Singh.

1821
01:45:21,001 --> 01:45:22,542
Run away?
- Run...

1822
01:45:22,959 --> 01:45:25,292
You'll be happy...and even
your families will calm down.

1823
01:45:25,417 --> 01:45:26,792
Your parents will curse you...

1824
01:45:26,834 --> 01:45:29,584
...saying that you were
a bunch of selfish fools.

1825
01:45:30,001 --> 01:45:32,417
They humiliated their
families and ran away.

1826
01:45:32,834 --> 01:45:36,459
They will cry and wail
for few days... that's all.

1827
01:45:36,667 --> 01:45:37,501
Simple.

1828
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:41,042
Look, guys,
you're out of time and options.

1829
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:45,042
If you don't run...then Karan
will get engaged to Binkle.

1830
01:45:59,792 --> 01:46:01,084
charan?

1831
01:46:03,667 --> 01:46:04,626
charan?

1832
01:46:06,209 --> 01:46:07,792
Yeah... Yes...

1833
01:46:07,959 --> 01:46:09,209
Are you ready, my boy?

1834
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:14,751
Yes... Ready!

1835
01:46:15,167 --> 01:46:18,042
Are you sure?
- Sure.

1836
01:46:19,834 --> 01:46:20,917
Good...

1837
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:25,584
You must leave early
morning...at 10'.25 sharp!

1838
01:46:26,917 --> 01:46:29,834
10'.25? What's the plan?

1839
01:46:30,376 --> 01:46:33,167
There's no plan.
I wake up at 10 am...

1840
01:46:33,209 --> 01:46:35,709
And takes me around
20-25 minutes to get ready.

1841
01:46:35,834 --> 01:46:38,417
At least I can see you guys run away.

1842
01:46:40,251 --> 01:46:43,167
Nafisa... keep my stuff
in your bag as well.

1843
01:46:43,709 --> 01:46:45,501
Why?
Don't you have your own bag?

1844
01:46:46,542 --> 01:46:49,167
If I take my bag,
what am I going to tell mom and dad?

1845
01:46:49,334 --> 01:46:51,167
"Bye, mom...Bye dad,
I am running away."

1846
01:46:51,209 --> 01:46:52,209
"Take care."

1847
01:46:53,084 --> 01:46:54,209
Point.

1848
01:46:54,334 --> 01:46:56,459
Kartar uncle's getting to everyone.

1849
01:46:57,626 --> 01:46:59,501
Thank you so much,
Aunty, for everything.

1850
01:46:59,542 --> 01:47:01,584
No need to thank me.

1851
01:47:02,376 --> 01:47:04,876
You must attend the wedding.
- Definitely.

1852
01:47:05,292 --> 01:47:07,626
She's here for the wedding...
of course, she will come.

1853
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:09,626
And Selfridges...

1854
01:47:09,751 --> 01:47:11,167
That's the place to go.
- Sandhu sir?

1855
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:16,126
Sandhu sir?
- Sandhu sir...

1856
01:47:16,626 --> 01:47:18,376
Why are they here?
- Sandhu sir.

1857
01:47:18,459 --> 01:47:20,501
I had to meet Karan.

1858
01:47:20,876 --> 01:47:21,959
Hello, Uncle.

1859
01:47:24,917 --> 01:47:26,417
Uncle!

1860
01:47:26,542 --> 01:47:28,251
Dad, I think they are going somewhere.

1861
01:47:31,334 --> 01:47:33,126
Uncle, this is Nafisa.
- Hi.

1862
01:47:33,292 --> 01:47:34,584
Manpreet, she's Nafisa.
- Hi.

1863
01:47:34,792 --> 01:47:36,376
From India.
She's my friend.

1864
01:47:42,084 --> 01:47:43,292
Uncle, get up!

1865
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:44,167
What happened?
- Look...

1866
01:47:44,251 --> 01:47:45,792
What happened my lad.
- Take a look.

1867
01:47:48,626 --> 01:47:51,626
Good Lord, who invited Sandhu Sir?

1868
01:47:52,209 --> 01:47:53,626
Is he and Manpreet
eloping with you guys too?

1869
01:47:53,667 --> 01:47:54,709
They are here on their own.

1870
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:57,876
We're here for Karan.
- Me? Where?

1871
01:47:58,001 --> 01:48:01,959
For the wedding suit, son.
- Oh no, Uncle...I've plenty of them.

1872
01:48:02,001 --> 01:48:04,084
Son... it's a tradition.

1873
01:48:04,417 --> 01:48:06,251
The father-in-law takes
his son-in-law personally...

1874
01:48:06,292 --> 01:48:08,042
...to buy the wedding suit.

1875
01:48:08,376 --> 01:48:11,001
I'm tattered here...
and she's worried about the suit.

1876
01:48:11,042 --> 01:48:12,417
Is everything alright, son?

1877
01:48:12,792 --> 01:48:14,501
Yes, uncle. It's great.

1878
01:48:15,334 --> 01:48:17,792
You know what uncle,
our choices are quite similar.

1879
01:48:17,917 --> 01:48:18,876
So why don't you get one for me?

1880
01:48:18,917 --> 01:48:21,417
I am a bit busy today.
- Busy with what?

1881
01:48:21,792 --> 01:48:23,001
You don't work, bro...

1882
01:48:26,126 --> 01:48:29,876
Actually...I had to take Nafisa for
sight-seeing around Central London.

1883
01:48:29,959 --> 01:48:30,584
So...
- Yeah!

1884
01:48:30,751 --> 01:48:33,209
I was thinking that he can take
me shopping around central London...

1885
01:48:33,251 --> 01:48:34,709
...and help me with
the hotel check-in too.

1886
01:48:34,751 --> 01:48:36,334
We have a big house out there, dear.

1887
01:48:36,584 --> 01:48:38,001
Doesn't look nice if you
check-in into a hotel.

1888
01:48:38,042 --> 01:48:40,292
Oh, no uncle...
- Doesn't look nice. Ask them.

1889
01:48:41,084 --> 01:48:43,084
You're right, dad.
She will stay with me.

1890
01:48:43,292 --> 01:48:44,251
Huh?

1891
01:48:46,709 --> 01:48:47,834
I mean she will stay with us.

1892
01:48:47,876 --> 01:48:49,459
And anyway, I am free...

1893
01:48:49,501 --> 01:48:51,209
...I'll show her
around Central London.

1894
01:48:51,459 --> 01:48:52,542
Dad, I'll pick her up.

1895
01:48:56,667 --> 01:48:57,667
Excuse me.

1896
01:49:00,792 --> 01:49:02,376
Great then.
- Okay.

1897
01:49:02,501 --> 01:49:03,751
come, Karan. Let's go.
- Go on.

1898
01:49:04,001 --> 01:49:06,001
You too, dear.
- Go, dear.

1899
01:49:06,459 --> 01:49:08,459
Oh, God! What now?

1900
01:49:08,501 --> 01:49:10,084
You were supposed to get up at 10 am.

1901
01:49:10,209 --> 01:49:12,417
I did set an alarm,
but why didn't it ring?

1902
01:49:13,417 --> 01:49:15,042
Oh, it's not working.

1903
01:49:17,001 --> 01:49:18,667
How could you set an alarm
in a watch that's not working?

1904
01:49:18,917 --> 01:49:20,709
The watch is fine...
but the alarm's turned off.

1905
01:49:21,042 --> 01:49:23,292
Jolly.
- Coming.

1906
01:49:26,334 --> 01:49:27,376
Yes, bro...

1907
01:49:29,834 --> 01:49:32,167
Get it fixed?
- Okay.

1908
01:49:32,501 --> 01:49:35,084
Careful, you fool...
that one's fine.

1909
01:49:36,042 --> 01:49:40,334
Everything's fine...
except for my time.

1910
01:50:09,501 --> 01:50:10,376
Stupid...

1911
01:50:11,542 --> 01:50:12,417
Come here!

1912
01:50:44,251 --> 01:50:45,334
Bravo...

1913
01:51:29,501 --> 01:51:30,376
I...

1914
01:51:31,667 --> 01:51:33,542
And you...

1915
01:51:33,834 --> 01:51:36,334
Who stares at a girl like this?

1916
01:51:37,084 --> 01:51:39,584
Funny... you're too funny.

1917
01:51:41,417 --> 01:51:42,376
What's wrong, charan?

1918
01:51:42,459 --> 01:51:44,417
Nafisa isn't answering my calls!

1919
01:51:45,501 --> 01:51:46,251
What?

1920
01:51:47,334 --> 01:51:49,584
Did Nafisa come here to elope
with charan, or for sight-seeing?

1921
01:51:49,667 --> 01:51:52,292
Relax, Sweety.
- Relax!

1922
01:51:52,626 --> 01:51:54,001
You're going to get
engaged to Binkle...

1923
01:51:54,042 --> 01:51:56,042
...and you want me
to relax and rejoice.

1924
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:58,626
Even you got engaged to Charan.

1925
01:51:58,751 --> 01:51:59,876
Doesn't matter...

1926
01:52:00,251 --> 01:52:02,459
You only have to pour the
drink into the glass, not drink it.

1927
01:52:03,417 --> 01:52:05,167
I don't care if Nafisa
shows up or not...

1928
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,751
...but we are eloping, and that's it.

1929
01:52:07,001 --> 01:52:08,917
Stand up!
- Let them finish...

1930
01:52:09,042 --> 01:52:12,251
I mean...I can't leave Charan alone.

1931
01:52:13,167 --> 01:52:13,959
He's such a duffer...

1932
01:52:14,459 --> 01:52:16,376
I mean, he's not smart like me.

1933
01:52:16,584 --> 01:52:17,751
So when are we going to run away?

1934
01:52:18,001 --> 01:52:18,959
After your engagement?

1935
01:52:19,042 --> 01:52:21,542
What's your problem in
eloping after the engagement?

1936
01:52:21,709 --> 01:52:23,001
Silly, girl...

1937
01:52:23,459 --> 01:52:25,251
Fine...go wear it...

1938
01:52:25,709 --> 01:52:28,042
Sandhu's wedding suit,
Binkle's ring...

1939
01:52:29,126 --> 01:52:31,501
Sweety, don't worry...

1940
01:52:32,042 --> 01:52:33,792
We're already married.

1941
01:52:34,834 --> 01:52:36,376
You're my wife.

1942
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:43,667
You scold me, curse me, abuse me...
beat me so lovingly.

1943
01:52:44,167 --> 01:52:46,626
That's what wives do,
not girlfriends.

1944
01:52:46,959 --> 01:52:50,334
"Sweety...Sweety...
I want your love."

1945
01:52:50,542 --> 01:52:53,501
"Sweety...Sweety...
I want your love."

1946
01:52:54,292 --> 01:52:55,334
Crazy boy...

1947
01:52:55,876 --> 01:52:56,751
Who is it?

1948
01:52:58,042 --> 01:53:00,626
It's Binkle... not Nafisa.

1949
01:53:03,042 --> 01:53:04,042
Binkle?

1950
01:53:04,292 --> 01:53:05,334
Binkle?

1951
01:53:06,751 --> 01:53:08,917
Binkle's calling him?

1952
01:53:10,209 --> 01:53:13,834
Hi, Binkle. How are you?
- How could I be...

1953
01:53:13,959 --> 01:53:16,251
...when I don't know what's
going to happen at my wedding.

1954
01:53:16,292 --> 01:53:18,376
Binkle...
- Yes, papa.

1955
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:20,084
We're leaving.

1956
01:53:20,334 --> 01:53:22,709
Get ready and come with your aunty.

1957
01:53:22,834 --> 01:53:24,542
Okay, papa.
- Bye, dear.

1958
01:53:26,792 --> 01:53:29,542
Is Karan coming?
- Yes,...he has to.

1959
01:53:29,876 --> 01:53:32,292
I mean...he is coming.

1960
01:53:32,376 --> 01:53:33,667
But Binkle...

1961
01:53:33,709 --> 01:53:38,001
Karan and Sweety are planning
to run away after the engagement.

1962
01:53:38,042 --> 01:53:39,042
Good...

1963
01:53:40,292 --> 01:53:41,876
...at least someone's
getting their love.

1964
01:53:44,959 --> 01:53:47,959
But...I'm feeling really bad for you.

1965
01:53:48,126 --> 01:53:50,876
And what hurts me is that
you're hiding something from me.

1966
01:53:53,709 --> 01:53:56,167
What is it? Tell me...

1967
01:53:59,584 --> 01:54:00,667
can we meet...

1968
01:54:01,584 --> 01:54:04,459
Sister-in-law, hurry up.

1969
01:54:04,584 --> 01:54:06,751
Or I'll start dancing right here.
- Coming.

1970
01:54:10,459 --> 01:54:14,126
I...wish you would come along too.

1971
01:54:14,334 --> 01:54:15,334
Why?

1972
01:54:16,251 --> 01:54:18,251
Did brother-in-law
attend Charan's wedding?

1973
01:54:21,417 --> 01:54:22,542
He didn't...

1974
01:54:23,917 --> 01:54:26,334
He sent his wife and children.

1975
01:54:27,501 --> 01:54:29,584
So I am sending my
wife and children too.

1976
01:54:32,292 --> 01:54:33,542
Go on.

1977
01:54:39,917 --> 01:54:41,126
Listen...

1978
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:43,959
Yes?

1979
01:54:47,834 --> 01:54:49,751
Give my love to Karan.

1980
01:55:22,751 --> 01:55:23,709
Charan!

1981
01:55:25,417 --> 01:55:26,376
Are you okay?
- Yeah...

1982
01:55:26,417 --> 01:55:28,292
Hi...
- Hi.

1983
01:55:30,834 --> 01:55:32,001
You're looking really nice.

1984
01:55:32,126 --> 01:55:33,001
Thank you.

1985
01:55:34,084 --> 01:55:36,501
If you don't mind,
can I ask you a question?

1986
01:55:37,126 --> 01:55:38,459
Please do...

1987
01:55:39,209 --> 01:55:41,126
How long have you been taking drugs?

1988
01:55:46,084 --> 01:55:47,709
Binkle, I swear to God...

1989
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:50,751
...I've never even touched
drugs in my whole life.

1990
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:53,292
Then, how did you fall down that day?

1991
01:55:55,376 --> 01:56:00,209
Actually...back then,
I didn't want to get in this relation.

1992
01:56:01,709 --> 01:56:05,334
Because of my girlfriend Nafisa.

1993
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:09,084
The so-called 'drugs'
was uncle's idea...

1994
01:56:09,292 --> 01:56:11,501
...so that you guys reject me.

1995
01:56:11,917 --> 01:56:14,126
But when I saw you...

1996
01:56:16,167 --> 01:56:17,584
Remember,
we were standing right here...

1997
01:56:17,626 --> 01:56:19,584
...when I got a text on my mobile.

1998
01:56:20,292 --> 01:56:22,792
It was from Uncle.
I sent you out to get water...

1999
01:56:22,834 --> 01:56:25,542
...because,
I wanted to call uncle and stop him...

2000
01:56:26,334 --> 01:56:27,584
And tell him that I...
like...Binkle...

2001
01:56:29,792 --> 01:56:31,042
But I wasn't getting
any network, and...

2002
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:32,417
...I was trying to call uncle.

2003
01:56:32,834 --> 01:56:35,667
I was trying to call him and wasn't
getting any signal on my phone...

2004
01:56:35,876 --> 01:56:37,709
I tried getting some network...

2005
01:56:37,751 --> 01:56:39,209
Then, I was finally started
getting some network, when...

2006
01:56:39,376 --> 01:56:41,376
Watch it. You'll fall down.

2007
01:56:44,417 --> 01:56:47,834
There was no one to stop me that day,
and I fell.

2008
01:56:49,417 --> 01:56:51,417
And it things turned south after that.

2009
01:56:52,917 --> 01:56:55,584
After that,
when I saw you at the airport...

2010
01:56:56,209 --> 01:56:58,042
And then at the mall...

2011
01:56:59,126 --> 01:57:04,292
The truth is Binkle, I don't
love Nafisa...in fact, I love you.

2012
01:57:07,584 --> 01:57:09,876
The other day,
when you bowed before the Lord...

2013
01:57:10,834 --> 01:57:12,792
...I thought that Lord's telling me...

2014
01:57:12,834 --> 01:57:16,209
"Binkle...I've chosen
a suitor for you."

2015
01:57:19,417 --> 01:57:20,501
I love you, Charan.

2016
01:57:23,626 --> 01:57:24,459
I love you.

2017
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:31,834
Sandhu sir,
the arrangements are really amazing.

2018
01:57:31,876 --> 01:57:33,751
Paramjeet's done everything...

2019
01:57:34,084 --> 01:57:35,876
How are you?
- Thank you.

2020
01:57:36,209 --> 01:57:36,876
Hurry up.

2021
01:57:38,126 --> 01:57:40,542
Father-in-law. Sandhu sir...
I mean Sandhu uncle.

2022
01:57:41,251 --> 01:57:42,459
Goggle...theme...

2023
01:57:42,501 --> 01:57:44,084
Kartar uncle.

2024
01:57:44,251 --> 01:57:45,417
Thank you.

2025
01:57:47,751 --> 01:57:49,667
"I'm in love with your eyes..."

2026
01:57:49,709 --> 01:57:52,084
"...take your lovely goggles off."

2027
01:57:52,126 --> 01:57:54,376
"I'm in love with your eyes..."

2028
01:57:54,417 --> 01:57:57,126
"...take your lovely goggles off."

2029
01:58:06,667 --> 01:58:10,834
"You're so beautiful...like the moon."

2030
01:58:11,292 --> 01:58:15,501
"Shining bright...are
your up-to-date jewels."

2031
01:58:25,126 --> 01:58:29,417
"You're so beautiful...like the moon."

2032
01:58:29,626 --> 01:58:33,709
"Shining bright...are
your up-to-date jewels."

2033
01:58:34,292 --> 01:58:36,459
"You chase me for no reason..."

2034
01:58:36,501 --> 01:58:38,501
"...keep raising the matter of love."

2035
01:58:38,876 --> 01:58:40,917
"Don't think too much, sweetheart..."

2036
01:58:41,084 --> 01:58:42,917
"...sway to the beat with me."

2037
01:58:42,959 --> 01:58:45,001
"When you dance wearing goggles..."

2038
01:58:45,042 --> 01:58:47,084
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2039
01:58:47,792 --> 01:58:49,542
"When you dance wearing goggles..."

2040
01:58:49,667 --> 01:58:52,251
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2041
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:54,167
"When you dance wearing goggles..."

2042
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:55,751
"...boys can't..."

2043
01:58:56,542 --> 01:58:58,709
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2044
01:59:21,917 --> 01:59:26,334
"Beloved...my attitude's
sweeter than honey."

2045
01:59:26,584 --> 01:59:28,709
"If I take my goggles off..."

2046
01:59:28,751 --> 01:59:30,876
"...there's chaos around."

2047
01:59:35,751 --> 01:59:40,292
"Baby, your sway to
the beat is all wrong..."

2048
01:59:40,417 --> 01:59:45,167
"...but when you repeat,
it makes my heart skip a beat."

2049
01:59:45,792 --> 01:59:48,042
"Don't try to feel..."

2050
01:59:48,209 --> 01:59:50,292
"Don't let your heart loose..."

2051
01:59:50,501 --> 01:59:52,501
"Don't think too much, sweetheart..."

2052
01:59:52,542 --> 01:59:54,459
"...sway to the beat with me."

2053
01:59:54,584 --> 01:59:56,584
"When you dance wearing goggles..."

2054
01:59:56,626 --> 01:59:58,959
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2055
01:59:59,292 --> 02:00:01,084
"When you dance wearing goggles..."

2056
02:00:01,251 --> 02:00:03,709
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2057
02:00:03,792 --> 02:00:05,626
"When you dance wearing goggles..."

2058
02:00:05,667 --> 02:00:07,334
"...boys can't..."

2059
02:00:08,126 --> 02:00:11,042
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2060
02:00:19,626 --> 02:00:21,709
"I don't need to praise you..."

2061
02:00:21,834 --> 02:00:23,876
"...because,
you have an average face."

2062
02:00:24,126 --> 02:00:26,376
"But I must say..."

2063
02:00:26,501 --> 02:00:29,334
"...your grace is mind-blowing."

2064
02:00:33,501 --> 02:00:37,959
"Why are you jealous of my beauty..."

2065
02:00:38,126 --> 02:00:43,042
"...my beauty is what gets you high."

2066
02:00:43,084 --> 02:00:45,709
"I'll read your eyes..."

2067
02:00:45,751 --> 02:00:47,959
"...make your heart beat faster."

2068
02:00:48,042 --> 02:00:50,334
"Don't think too much, sweetheart..."

2069
02:00:50,376 --> 02:00:52,292
"...sway to the beat with me."

2070
02:00:52,334 --> 02:00:54,084
"When I dance wearing goggles..."

2071
02:00:54,292 --> 02:00:55,709
"...boys can't..."

2072
02:00:56,959 --> 02:00:58,709
"When I dance wearing goggles..."

2073
02:00:58,834 --> 02:01:01,459
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2074
02:01:01,584 --> 02:01:03,417
"When you dance wearing goggles..."

2075
02:01:03,542 --> 02:01:04,959
"...boys can't..."

2076
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:08,626
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2077
02:01:19,667 --> 02:01:21,501
"...boys can't..."

2078
02:01:21,959 --> 02:01:23,459
"...boys can't..."

2079
02:01:24,251 --> 02:01:27,334
"...boys can't take their eyes off."

2080
02:01:31,209 --> 02:01:36,792
"When you dance wearing goggles..."

2081
02:01:36,917 --> 02:01:42,834
"...boys can't...take their eyes off."

2082
02:01:45,042 --> 02:01:47,251
Who could that be?

2083
02:02:07,001 --> 02:02:08,667
What's the matter, Kartar?

2084
02:02:09,542 --> 02:02:12,626
You've been dancing
a lot wearing goggles?

2085
02:02:14,167 --> 02:02:16,709
Brother, you?

2086
02:02:16,876 --> 02:02:19,876
I had to...because of your stupidity.

2087
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:23,376
You idiot...what are you doing?

2088
02:02:23,834 --> 02:02:25,084
Letting the children elope.

2089
02:02:25,501 --> 02:02:27,417
And what about my reputation?

2090
02:02:27,542 --> 02:02:28,667
Your reputation?

2091
02:02:29,626 --> 02:02:30,459
Why?

2092
02:02:31,001 --> 02:02:32,834
Don't dead guys get humiliated?

2093
02:02:33,126 --> 02:02:36,542
Brother, I am only doing this
for the happiness of our children.

2094
02:02:37,167 --> 02:02:39,376
Which children are you talking about?

2095
02:02:39,834 --> 02:02:41,709
Children these days...

2096
02:02:41,959 --> 02:02:44,251
...think it's cool
to hurt their parents.

2097
02:02:44,417 --> 02:02:45,917
Cool.

2098
02:02:46,417 --> 02:02:48,667
Even you're looking cool, brother.

2099
02:02:48,959 --> 02:02:50,417
No change at all.

2100
02:02:50,751 --> 02:02:53,126
You look like my younger brother.

2101
02:02:53,667 --> 02:02:56,126
cardio?
- Curse you.

2102
02:02:56,667 --> 02:02:59,042
Once you're dead...you stop aging.

2103
02:02:59,251 --> 02:03:02,251
You'll find out later.
- Don't say that, brother.

2104
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:05,626
I don't want to know.
- But you must know one thing.

2105
02:03:05,834 --> 02:03:08,959
Jeeto and Baldev raised
my children as their own.

2106
02:03:09,834 --> 02:03:11,376
They never treated them as an orphan.

2107
02:03:11,959 --> 02:03:14,042
If these children hurt them...

2108
02:03:15,084 --> 02:03:19,209
...then, I swear to God,
I'll never forgive you Kartar.

2109
02:03:34,042 --> 02:03:35,959
The tractor's here too.

2110
02:03:39,917 --> 02:03:41,209
So is the mannequin.

2111
02:03:42,376 --> 02:03:43,792
Good morning.

2112
02:03:45,501 --> 02:03:47,126
It's so cold outside.

2113
02:03:53,334 --> 02:03:54,376
What's wrong?

2114
02:03:55,334 --> 02:03:56,667
Nothing, sister.
- Bless you.

2115
02:03:56,834 --> 02:03:58,042
What brings you to the
farm at this early hour?

2116
02:03:58,084 --> 02:04:00,334
Yes, I came here for a horseshoe.

2117
02:04:00,751 --> 02:04:02,417
I'll put it on my door.

2118
02:04:02,959 --> 02:04:05,501
God save me from anymore evil-eye...
I don't want any more mess-ups.

2119
02:04:05,667 --> 02:04:06,501
Give it.

2120
02:04:07,459 --> 02:04:09,709
This is the first time
Your 'Ideas-man' did a job right.

2121
02:04:10,251 --> 02:04:11,334
Get lost.

2122
02:04:12,417 --> 02:04:16,584
Sister...I have a request.

2123
02:04:17,126 --> 02:04:18,709
Please cancel this wedding.

2124
02:04:20,626 --> 02:04:22,167
Have you been drinking in the morning?

2125
02:04:22,792 --> 02:04:25,376
I'll make coffee for
you... pass me the sugar.

2126
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:28,584
Karan and Sweety...
- Sweety?

2127
02:04:29,084 --> 02:04:30,417
What did that
'loose-character' do now?

2128
02:04:30,459 --> 02:04:31,834
Forget Sweety.

2129
02:04:32,334 --> 02:04:35,667
charan and Nafisa love each other.

2130
02:04:35,876 --> 02:04:38,792
What are you driveling?
- I swear, sister.

2131
02:04:40,251 --> 02:04:43,459
How did you know?
- I always knew.

2132
02:04:44,209 --> 02:04:45,584
So why didn't you say something?

2133
02:04:46,209 --> 02:04:48,334
You know brother's temper.

2134
02:04:51,084 --> 02:04:52,626
charan is my boy.

2135
02:04:53,626 --> 02:04:55,709
I won't let his life get ruined.

2136
02:04:57,542 --> 02:04:59,459
Fine... I'll do something.

2137
02:05:00,001 --> 02:05:02,626
Hurry up.
- Let's go.

2138
02:05:06,876 --> 02:05:08,584
Kul, tell her Kartar isn't at home.

2139
02:05:08,876 --> 02:05:10,167
I'm here to see you.

2140
02:05:14,001 --> 02:05:15,626
We must talk...
it's about Charan.

2141
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:20,001
I...don't love Nafisa anymore.

2142
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:23,209
What?
- What?

2143
02:05:24,209 --> 02:05:27,376
I... Sweety..

2144
02:05:27,876 --> 02:05:29,751
What Sweety?

2145
02:05:30,376 --> 02:05:33,834
Karan, I... - Why don't you
clearly say that you love Sweety?

2146
02:05:33,876 --> 02:05:34,959
Are you crazy?

2147
02:05:35,334 --> 02:05:36,959
I'm in love with Binkle.

2148
02:05:39,167 --> 02:05:41,542
My Fiancée.
- Fiancée?

2149
02:05:42,876 --> 02:05:45,917
I mean...we did get engaged?
- Yes, even I got engaged to him.

2150
02:05:46,042 --> 02:05:47,751
Should I call him my fiancé?

2151
02:05:48,334 --> 02:05:50,459
You two finish fighting first,
then we'll talk. - Shut up.

2152
02:05:50,751 --> 02:05:51,792
Fine, tell me.

2153
02:05:53,709 --> 02:05:56,751
If we're running away,
I'm running away with Binkle.

2154
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:59,084
Outstanding...end of all troubles.

2155
02:05:59,417 --> 02:06:01,792
Your fiancée with me,
and my fiancée with you.

2156
02:06:02,334 --> 02:06:03,334
Simple.

2157
02:06:03,417 --> 02:06:05,292
It's not that simple.

2158
02:06:06,167 --> 02:06:07,959
How am I going to tell Nafisa?

2159
02:06:08,376 --> 02:06:09,626
It will be really harsh on her.

2160
02:06:09,667 --> 02:06:12,167
She will be heartbroken.

2161
02:06:15,376 --> 02:06:17,376
Wow Nafisa,
you're going to live a thousand years.

2162
02:06:17,542 --> 02:06:19,417
Charan was just talking about you.

2163
02:06:21,126 --> 02:06:22,667
Nafisa, actually...

2164
02:06:22,709 --> 02:06:27,376
charan...I don't think
we're made for each other.

2165
02:06:27,626 --> 02:06:28,667
What?

2166
02:06:30,376 --> 02:06:32,334
After coming here, I realized...

2167
02:06:32,584 --> 02:06:34,667
...that Manpreet is my true love, not you.
- What?

2168
02:06:34,751 --> 02:06:36,584
Manpreet?
How can Manpreet be your true love?

2169
02:06:36,626 --> 02:06:37,667
You didn't think about me?

2170
02:06:37,709 --> 02:06:39,251
About my feelings?
- Listen...

2171
02:06:39,292 --> 02:06:41,334
No... you broke my heart...
You broke my heart...

2172
02:06:41,376 --> 02:06:42,667
You can't do this to me.
No!

2173
02:06:42,834 --> 02:06:44,584
Mad! He's completely mad.

2174
02:06:44,792 --> 02:06:45,959
How can you be so stupid...

2175
02:06:46,084 --> 02:06:46,834
Just a minute ago, you and Nafisa...

2176
02:06:46,876 --> 02:06:48,459
Forget what I was saying
and listen to what she is saying.

2177
02:06:48,667 --> 02:06:50,459
What are you saying?
How can you do this to me?

2178
02:06:55,126 --> 02:06:58,667
Everything under control.
I fixed everything.

2179
02:06:59,459 --> 02:07:01,042
What did you do now?

2180
02:07:01,084 --> 02:07:05,626
No need to elope now...
I've told sister Jeeto everything.

2181
02:07:05,917 --> 02:07:08,667
That Charan and Nafisa
love each other.

2182
02:07:12,042 --> 02:07:14,542
And she must have told
brother Baldev by now.

2183
02:07:14,834 --> 02:07:17,084
Father...
Father knows...

2184
02:07:17,126 --> 02:07:19,209
What do I do?

2185
02:07:19,251 --> 02:07:21,084
Suicide!
- What are you doing?

2186
02:07:21,167 --> 02:07:22,209
What are you doing?
- Have you lost your mind?

2187
02:07:22,292 --> 02:07:23,459
What's wrong with him?

2188
02:07:23,792 --> 02:07:26,251
Is he actually doing drugs now?

2189
02:07:29,042 --> 02:07:30,001
Charan!

2190
02:07:40,209 --> 02:07:41,292
Uncle...

2191
02:07:42,417 --> 02:07:43,376
Sit.

2192
02:07:44,042 --> 02:07:47,501
This is brother Charan,
this is Nafisa.

2193
02:07:47,834 --> 02:07:48,834
This...
- Karan.

2194
02:07:48,876 --> 02:07:50,376
No, Manpreet.

2195
02:07:50,542 --> 02:07:52,209
And this is Binkle.

2196
02:07:52,667 --> 02:07:55,126
So now...it's charan and Binkle...

2197
02:07:55,417 --> 02:07:57,167
...Nafisa and Manpreet!

2198
02:08:06,126 --> 02:08:08,376
He's here...

2199
02:08:09,251 --> 02:08:11,334
Come, Kartar...
- come...

2200
02:08:11,876 --> 02:08:13,376
You guys called me.
- Yes.

2201
02:08:14,084 --> 02:08:15,626
Tell him...
- What?

2202
02:08:15,959 --> 02:08:18,126
That Charan loves Nafisa.

2203
02:08:18,292 --> 02:08:19,417
Isn't that what you said?

2204
02:08:20,376 --> 02:08:21,667
Yes, sister, I did.

2205
02:08:24,209 --> 02:08:28,376
My charan wants to marry Nafisa.

2206
02:08:29,001 --> 02:08:30,626
No, not at all.

2207
02:08:30,917 --> 02:08:33,584
Are you satisfied now?
- What are you saying?

2208
02:08:33,709 --> 02:08:34,667
Why are you lying?

2209
02:08:34,876 --> 02:08:38,042
Sister...my information was wrong.
- What?

2210
02:08:38,084 --> 02:08:40,209
Then give us the right information.

2211
02:08:40,501 --> 02:08:43,792
Tell her...that Nafisa
is Karan's girlfriend.

2212
02:08:45,126 --> 02:08:46,709
What's this new twist now?

2213
02:08:47,251 --> 02:08:48,626
Nafisa is Karan's girlfriend?

2214
02:08:48,792 --> 02:08:50,584
Not yet...
but let me confirm first.

2215
02:08:50,626 --> 02:08:52,376
But one thing's confirmed, brother.

2216
02:08:52,792 --> 02:08:56,292
Charan wants to marry Binkle.
- I see...

2217
02:08:56,584 --> 02:09:00,459
Why don't you also say...
that Karan wants to marry Sweety?

2218
02:09:00,626 --> 02:09:01,751
How did you know?

2219
02:09:02,751 --> 02:09:04,667
Binkle is my would-be daughter-in-law.

2220
02:09:04,834 --> 02:09:09,209
That hurts, brother.
- Sweety is my would-be daughter-in-law.

2221
02:09:09,542 --> 02:09:11,834
Kids, you know...
they can't make up their mind.

2222
02:09:11,917 --> 02:09:13,167
This is too much...

2223
02:09:13,501 --> 02:09:16,167
All that alcohol has
messed up your brain.

2224
02:09:17,542 --> 02:09:19,334
You never did understand
what marriage is all about...

2225
02:09:19,376 --> 02:09:20,626
...and, you never will.

2226
02:09:21,417 --> 02:09:23,376
We're looking forward
to two wedding...

2227
02:09:23,667 --> 02:09:26,417
...and he's creating
rifts between families.

2228
02:09:26,626 --> 02:09:27,459
Sister...
- That's the limit.

2229
02:09:27,667 --> 02:09:29,459
Listen to me...
- I don't want to hear anything.

2230
02:09:29,584 --> 02:09:32,042
Honestly, brother...
you can ask the kids.

2231
02:09:32,167 --> 02:09:34,001
Let it be...there's no need.

2232
02:09:34,376 --> 02:09:35,876
Nonsense...
- Brother, I am telling the truth.

2233
02:09:36,042 --> 02:09:38,751
Brother... - All that alcohol
has messed up your mind.

2234
02:09:38,917 --> 02:09:41,042
Listen to me, sister-in-law.

2235
02:09:41,792 --> 02:09:43,792
We've been through a lot already.

2236
02:09:44,834 --> 02:09:50,584
All these years I've been sending
you pickles, jams, and snacks.

2237
02:09:51,376 --> 02:09:52,792
And this is how you repay me.

2238
02:09:54,084 --> 02:09:56,251
Dear.
- Sister-in-law.

2239
02:09:56,876 --> 02:10:00,459
Someone believe me.

2240
02:10:21,667 --> 02:10:22,709
Hi.

2241
02:10:23,584 --> 02:10:25,126
I am scared to think that...

2242
02:10:25,167 --> 02:10:28,667
...after you guys run away,
father might just get me married.

2243
02:10:41,251 --> 02:10:42,459
What are you doing here?

2244
02:10:43,167 --> 02:10:45,084
I brought her here.
- I saw that...

2245
02:10:45,209 --> 02:10:47,084
That's why I followed you guys.

2246
02:10:47,876 --> 02:10:49,167
What are you doing here?

2247
02:10:49,376 --> 02:10:51,126
Binkle and I love each other.

2248
02:10:51,334 --> 02:10:52,334
Since when?

2249
02:10:53,084 --> 02:10:55,042
Because I dumped you this morning...

2250
02:10:55,084 --> 02:10:57,417
...and if you're already
in love with her, then...

2251
02:10:57,459 --> 02:10:58,751
...isn't that too soon?

2252
02:10:59,292 --> 02:11:02,167
And, if this has been
going on for a while now...

2253
02:11:03,209 --> 02:11:04,959
Manpreet hit him!

2254
02:11:06,542 --> 02:11:07,584
Hit him!

2255
02:11:13,584 --> 02:11:14,709
What is that?

2256
02:11:21,667 --> 02:11:24,042
I don't know... I don't
know any judo or karate.

2257
02:11:24,084 --> 02:11:26,251
I don't...
- I don't either.

2258
02:11:26,292 --> 02:11:28,834
can't guys fight even
if they don't know judo?

2259
02:11:42,792 --> 02:11:44,251
Are you running away too?

2260
02:11:44,292 --> 02:11:46,251
Why will they run, uncle?
We're running away.

2261
02:11:46,417 --> 02:11:48,626
No one's going anywhere now.
- Why?

2262
02:11:49,251 --> 02:11:51,167
Did you come up with a new idea now?

2263
02:11:51,292 --> 02:11:53,792
I don't need any more ideas.

2264
02:11:54,501 --> 02:11:56,126
Let things proceed the way they are.

2265
02:11:56,501 --> 02:11:59,501
Take whatever you are getting.

2266
02:12:01,667 --> 02:12:03,876
Take what? Radish?

2267
02:12:04,042 --> 02:12:06,667
Potato... no, sweet-potato.
Radish, carrot...

2268
02:12:06,751 --> 02:12:07,917
Take what?

2269
02:12:08,084 --> 02:12:09,667
Father had 4000 tractors.

2270
02:12:10,209 --> 02:12:11,626
Now he's got only 2800.

2271
02:12:11,834 --> 02:12:14,376
From Gill uncle,
he's turned into 'card uncle.'

2272
02:12:14,584 --> 02:12:15,626
The wedding is tomorrow.

2273
02:12:15,667 --> 02:12:17,001
What else can we do
other than running away?

2274
02:12:17,209 --> 02:12:18,876
You couldn't do anything, and now...

2275
02:12:19,042 --> 02:12:22,709
Karan, tell her about
all that I did...

2276
02:12:22,876 --> 02:12:25,667
Will you please tell me what you did?

2277
02:12:27,167 --> 02:12:28,376
What did you do?

2278
02:12:28,709 --> 02:12:31,501
Whose idea was it to target Binkle?

2279
02:12:31,751 --> 02:12:32,542
So what?

2280
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:34,751
This duffer fell in
love with her instead.

2281
02:12:34,959 --> 02:12:37,501
And what about running away?
Milkha Singh?

2282
02:12:37,542 --> 02:12:38,876
10'.25?

2283
02:12:39,334 --> 02:12:40,501
If only we had run away on time...

2284
02:12:40,542 --> 02:12:42,251
...we wouldn't have
ran into Sandhu sir.

2285
02:12:42,292 --> 02:12:45,751
And what about my idea of having
both the wedding at the same place?

2286
02:12:45,834 --> 02:12:48,126
So that you can attend
both the weddings.

2287
02:12:48,167 --> 02:12:51,167
And this... this is
no way to handover kids.

2288
02:12:51,292 --> 02:12:52,709
If only you had done
things properly that day...

2289
02:12:52,751 --> 02:12:54,542
...then, we wouldn't
be in this trouble, uncle.

2290
02:12:55,001 --> 02:12:56,667
I would've been in Punjab,
he would've been in London.

2291
02:12:56,709 --> 02:12:58,167
He would be getting
married to Binkle...

2292
02:12:58,209 --> 02:12:59,376
...and I would be getting
married to Sweety.

2293
02:12:59,417 --> 02:13:02,001
And our love...
- What love?

2294
02:13:02,709 --> 02:13:06,542
The current generation
treats love more like a game.

2295
02:13:06,959 --> 02:13:10,667
It's either on that side...or on this.

2296
02:13:10,834 --> 02:13:12,334
Hello, Mr. Kartar Singh Bajwa.

2297
02:13:12,751 --> 02:13:15,167
Karan and I have been on the
same side for the past two years.

2298
02:13:15,459 --> 02:13:16,792
You should be taunting him.

2299
02:13:17,167 --> 02:13:19,542
That duffer. - That one.
- How is it my fault now?

2300
02:13:19,792 --> 02:13:21,417
Love cannot be planned.

2301
02:13:21,459 --> 02:13:24,417
It just happened...
I fell in love...with Binkle.

2302
02:13:25,584 --> 02:13:26,792
Excuse me, huh...

2303
02:13:27,917 --> 02:13:30,542
You two started this game, remember?

2304
02:13:31,584 --> 02:13:32,959
Yeah, so I only did a good thing.

2305
02:13:33,126 --> 02:13:34,709
Otherwise,...you wouldn't
be with Binkle today.

2306
02:13:34,917 --> 02:13:36,084
What kind of a brother is he?

2307
02:13:36,126 --> 02:13:37,417
Are you going to take
credit for that too?

2308
02:13:37,792 --> 02:13:39,917
Karan, you can only hatch schemes.

2309
02:13:40,209 --> 02:13:43,834
You can fool people, lie to them.
And open 'chains'!

2310
02:13:44,042 --> 02:13:45,584
You're selfish. Selfish.

2311
02:13:46,084 --> 02:13:47,667
And why do you keep
calling me a duffer?

2312
02:13:48,084 --> 02:13:50,501
Could you muster the courage
to tell aunty about Sweety?

2313
02:13:50,709 --> 02:13:51,792
coward.

2314
02:13:52,667 --> 02:13:54,001
Bravo, Charan.

2315
02:13:55,501 --> 02:13:57,417
You really showed
him the mirror today.

2316
02:13:57,792 --> 02:13:59,042
Bravo.

2317
02:14:00,334 --> 02:14:03,334
Uncle...what is this?

2318
02:14:04,251 --> 02:14:05,584
This is Binkle, my boy.

2319
02:14:05,792 --> 02:14:08,501
No... this is a phone,
and that's what it should be.

2320
02:14:08,959 --> 02:14:13,042
You turn living people into phones,
vegetables or shoes.

2321
02:14:13,292 --> 02:14:15,709
And your so-called
'Bernard Shaw' ideas...

2322
02:14:15,751 --> 02:14:18,626
Anyone who believes
in it...cannot be saved.

2323
02:14:18,876 --> 02:14:21,292
"Charan my boy, 'I have an idea."

2324
02:14:21,542 --> 02:14:23,292
"High... drugs..."

2325
02:14:23,459 --> 02:14:24,667
"We'll put a doubt in their mind."

2326
02:14:24,959 --> 02:14:26,959
Father's doubts have
turned into reality.

2327
02:14:27,001 --> 02:14:30,209
You know... he keeps
spying on me all day.

2328
02:14:30,292 --> 02:14:32,626
He keeps tasting powder...
talcum powder.

2329
02:14:33,542 --> 02:14:34,459
And my mom...

2330
02:14:34,834 --> 02:14:36,584
Just don't ask.

2331
02:14:37,084 --> 02:14:38,584
She's folded her hands
in front of God so many times...

2332
02:14:38,626 --> 02:14:40,792
...that she can't fold them
anymore even to greet someone!

2333
02:14:42,459 --> 02:14:43,501
Yes, Kartar uncle.

2334
02:14:43,792 --> 02:14:45,792
Because of you,
this decent boy became a druggy...

2335
02:14:46,001 --> 02:14:48,376
...and his father, into a hawker.

2336
02:14:52,751 --> 02:14:54,542
Wow, Kartar uncle, fantastic.

2337
02:14:55,251 --> 02:14:57,709
I know your nephews.

2338
02:14:58,126 --> 02:14:59,626
But now I know you pretty well too.

2339
02:15:00,292 --> 02:15:02,542
Your family's filled with lunatics.

2340
02:15:03,084 --> 02:15:04,584
Thank God I am saved.

2341
02:15:04,917 --> 02:15:06,084
I am going back.

2342
02:15:06,209 --> 02:15:08,709
Manpreet, let me know whenever
you want to get married.

2343
02:15:10,626 --> 02:15:12,209
What are we waiting for?

2344
02:15:12,751 --> 02:15:14,251
We should leave too.

2345
02:15:14,917 --> 02:15:18,542
Manpreet, will you take Binkle home...

2346
02:15:18,584 --> 02:15:20,167
...or should I call Sandhu sir?

2347
02:15:22,792 --> 02:15:26,334
And I've brother Baldev and
sister Jeeto's number on speed-dial.

2348
02:15:28,251 --> 02:15:29,792
No one's going anywhere.

2349
02:15:31,334 --> 02:15:33,084
Everyone's going home.

2350
02:15:33,626 --> 02:15:35,542
What's wrong with you uncle?

2351
02:15:37,251 --> 02:15:41,376
I finally see the reality...
thanks to a dream.

2352
02:15:43,376 --> 02:15:48,667
If your love is true,
then He will help you?

2353
02:15:50,667 --> 02:15:54,167
He who doesn't let sleeping
birds fall from trees...

2354
02:15:55,334 --> 02:15:57,876
...can never leave
his devotees stranded.

2355
02:15:59,042 --> 02:16:01,167
come on...let's go home.

2356
02:16:31,626 --> 02:16:32,751
Girls, you have to dance...

2357
02:16:32,792 --> 02:16:34,417
You'll be the star of the event.
- Of course...

2358
02:16:34,459 --> 02:16:36,542
Mom, my necklace.
- Must be somewhere around here.

2359
02:16:36,667 --> 02:16:38,001
Kul.
- Yes.

2360
02:16:38,417 --> 02:16:39,626
Where's charan?

2361
02:16:39,751 --> 02:16:41,042
He's over at sister Jeeto's home...

2362
02:16:41,084 --> 02:16:42,334
...to tie Karan's turban.

2363
02:16:42,376 --> 02:16:43,667
Found it.
- I see... Okay.

2364
02:17:04,042 --> 02:17:07,334
Karan...look at our turbans.
- It's fine.

2365
02:17:08,334 --> 02:17:09,417
Look at it again... look closely.

2366
02:17:15,876 --> 02:17:18,917
Can anyone say who's
Karan and who's Charan?

2367
02:17:19,542 --> 02:17:20,751
Let's exchange our clothes.

2368
02:17:20,876 --> 02:17:23,251
You can marry Sweety
and I'll marry Binkle.

2369
02:17:24,334 --> 02:17:26,667
charan, why didn't
I think of this idea?

2370
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:28,376
You never wore a turban before this.

2371
02:17:28,959 --> 02:17:32,584
You just proved that we're
not cousins, but brothers.

2372
02:17:32,626 --> 02:17:36,626
Come on, take off your suit.
I'll give Sweety this good news.

2373
02:17:39,751 --> 02:17:41,834
Why doesn't she answer her phone?

2374
02:17:42,042 --> 02:17:43,167
I'll text her instead.

2375
02:17:43,626 --> 02:17:45,126
Sweety...

2376
02:17:45,334 --> 02:17:46,751
Karan, are we doing the right thing?

2377
02:17:48,084 --> 02:17:49,251
Absolutely right.

2378
02:17:49,459 --> 02:17:51,376
This way we'll be happy,
and also our families.

2379
02:18:12,876 --> 02:18:15,959
My Charan looks so happy today.

2380
02:18:16,084 --> 02:18:19,334
Look at him. He is dance like Karan.

2381
02:18:19,417 --> 02:18:20,709
He is excited.

2382
02:18:32,501 --> 02:18:34,834
What happened, Karan?
Why the long face?

2383
02:18:35,292 --> 02:18:37,334
Smile. That's more like it.

2384
02:19:03,417 --> 02:19:07,042
Lord...you're the omniscient One.

2385
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:12,084
The happiness of my family
lies at Your threshold.

2386
02:19:12,834 --> 02:19:16,209
Have mercy...

2387
02:19:22,834 --> 02:19:24,501
congratulations! Congratulations!

2388
02:19:24,542 --> 02:19:26,501
Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

2389
02:19:26,626 --> 02:19:28,167
Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

2390
02:19:30,834 --> 02:19:33,417
Kartar. come here...
greet everyone.

2391
02:19:33,542 --> 02:19:35,876
This way, Kartar.

2392
02:19:35,959 --> 02:19:37,376
Aren't you going to greet charan?

2393
02:19:37,417 --> 02:19:38,584
come here...
- Just a minute.

2394
02:19:38,626 --> 02:19:39,459
Kartar.

2395
02:19:41,042 --> 02:19:42,709
Kartar...come here.

2396
02:19:43,334 --> 02:19:45,626
Greet Sandhu sir.
- Sandhu sir...

2397
02:19:46,084 --> 02:19:48,417
congratulations! Congratulations!
- Kartar...

2398
02:19:48,542 --> 02:19:50,376
Who's going to welcome Gill sir?

2399
02:19:50,542 --> 02:19:52,292
Gill sir...

2400
02:19:52,501 --> 02:19:56,042
Kartar...come here.
- Here.

2401
02:19:56,126 --> 02:19:57,334
come here first.

2402
02:19:57,876 --> 02:20:00,584
Sister... Brother,
let's not make a scene here.

2403
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:02,542
I'll meet everyone once we're inside.

2404
02:20:02,584 --> 02:20:04,626
Don't waste time...
please, let's go inside.

2405
02:20:04,667 --> 02:20:07,251
Let's go inside, please.
- Yes...he's right.

2406
02:20:07,459 --> 02:20:08,959
Come on.

2407
02:20:09,001 --> 02:20:11,459
Come...
- come on.

2408
02:20:11,751 --> 02:20:15,167
Everyone's let's go inside.
- come on.

2409
02:20:15,376 --> 02:20:17,709
Come...

2410
02:20:18,751 --> 02:20:20,251
Upstairs...

2411
02:20:23,792 --> 02:20:25,459
Sweety, what are you doing down here?

2412
02:20:25,834 --> 02:20:27,459
Papa, I can't go
ahead with this wedding.

2413
02:20:29,209 --> 02:20:30,209
What?

2414
02:20:30,917 --> 02:20:32,209
What did she say?

2415
02:20:32,542 --> 02:20:33,584
God answered my prayers.

2416
02:20:33,626 --> 02:20:34,959
Finally, it will all be over.

2417
02:20:35,126 --> 02:20:38,459
Does she know about
his drugs... - Be quiet.

2418
02:20:39,709 --> 02:20:42,542
Sweety, what are you doing?
- Be quiet, Charan.

2419
02:20:44,167 --> 02:20:47,167
Papa...I love Karan.

2420
02:20:48,084 --> 02:20:49,417
Sister-in-law.
- Oh, God! - Aunty...

2421
02:20:49,459 --> 02:20:51,042
And even he...
- Are you okay, Jeeto?

2422
02:20:51,501 --> 02:20:52,917
I think her blood
pressure's low again.

2423
02:20:52,917 --> 02:20:54,126
Someone get some
sugared water for her.

2424
02:20:54,251 --> 02:20:57,251
I'll get it. - Where are you going?
You're the groom.

2425
02:20:57,292 --> 02:20:58,667
But she's my mom.

2426
02:20:58,792 --> 02:21:02,001
I didn't know that,
that my son's wedding day...

2427
02:21:02,042 --> 02:21:04,626
...would be my last.

2428
02:21:04,792 --> 02:21:08,459
What are you saying?
- About this being her last day.

2429
02:21:08,959 --> 02:21:10,709
You fool, not me...I meant her.

2430
02:21:10,959 --> 02:21:12,209
What is she saying?

2431
02:21:13,626 --> 02:21:17,167
Do you want to marry her?
- No-no-no...

2432
02:21:17,209 --> 02:21:19,292
Why would I?
I don't want to marry her?

2433
02:21:19,501 --> 02:21:20,667
Son.

2434
02:21:21,126 --> 02:21:22,209
Just a minute...

2435
02:21:22,709 --> 02:21:23,584
Okay.

2436
02:21:24,042 --> 02:21:25,834
It will be 11 o'clock soon.
- Yes.

2437
02:21:27,251 --> 02:21:28,459
Is everything alright?

2438
02:21:29,709 --> 02:21:30,876
Does everything look okay to you?

2439
02:21:31,001 --> 02:21:33,709
Didn't I tell you before...
she has a loose character?

2440
02:21:34,001 --> 02:21:35,709
First, she wooed Charan...

2441
02:21:36,001 --> 02:21:37,876
...and now, she's eyeing my Karan.

2442
02:21:38,542 --> 02:21:39,959
Hello, mom...
- What?

2443
02:21:40,084 --> 02:21:43,084
Your Karan's been in a relationship
with me for two years now.

2444
02:21:43,542 --> 02:21:44,459
Aunty...

2445
02:21:44,667 --> 02:21:46,417
My boyfriend in the mall...
that's him.

2446
02:21:46,501 --> 02:21:48,917
Your son, Karan...
- Tell your mom.

2447
02:21:49,001 --> 02:21:51,459
Sweety, be quiet.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

2448
02:21:51,626 --> 02:21:52,626
Why are you telling me?

2449
02:21:52,667 --> 02:21:53,959
Why don't you tell your father?

2450
02:21:54,251 --> 02:21:56,001
Uncle, your son Charan...

2451
02:21:56,167 --> 02:21:58,001
...wants to marry Binkle, and not me.

2452
02:21:58,084 --> 02:21:59,042
No papa.

2453
02:21:59,084 --> 02:22:00,626
She's wrong...no-no...

2454
02:22:00,709 --> 02:22:05,084
Oh, God. - Sandhu uncle,
you can ask Binkle yourself.

2455
02:22:08,001 --> 02:22:09,501
What is she saying, dear?

2456
02:22:10,459 --> 02:22:11,417
Is it true?

2457
02:22:12,834 --> 02:22:15,542
It's a lie...lie...lies...

2458
02:22:15,626 --> 02:22:19,709
I will only marry the girl
my mom and dad wants me to.

2459
02:22:19,751 --> 02:22:21,126
Yes... see?

2460
02:22:21,167 --> 02:22:23,001
Have you two lost your minds?

2461
02:22:24,334 --> 02:22:26,459
Kartar uncle, you know everything.

2462
02:22:26,584 --> 02:22:27,501
Why don't you say something?

2463
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:28,959
What can I say, Sweety?

2464
02:22:29,292 --> 02:22:32,459
I've already told them everything,
but they don't believe me.

2465
02:22:32,834 --> 02:22:34,959
Sister...these two are lying.

2466
02:22:35,001 --> 02:22:38,001
Sweety isn't crazy
to refuse getting married...

2467
02:22:38,167 --> 02:22:40,584
...in front of the entire community.

2468
02:22:40,834 --> 02:22:43,042
And, can't you understand
Binkle's silence, Sandhu sir.

2469
02:22:43,084 --> 02:22:44,709
She loves Charan.

2470
02:22:45,459 --> 02:22:47,667
Kartar. Don't try to be a judge...

2471
02:22:47,709 --> 02:22:50,084
Stay if you like, or else...
Or else?

2472
02:22:50,542 --> 02:22:51,501
Or else what?

2473
02:22:51,834 --> 02:22:53,292
You'll break ties with me, won't you?

2474
02:22:54,001 --> 02:22:55,209
Of course, you can do that.

2475
02:22:55,959 --> 02:22:57,542
You two are an expert
in breaking relationships.

2476
02:22:57,917 --> 02:22:59,209
And these children
are not telling the truth...

2477
02:22:59,251 --> 02:23:01,459
...because they fear that you
might break ties with them too.

2478
02:23:01,501 --> 02:23:04,751
Kartar! Get lost from here...
get lost.

2479
02:23:05,001 --> 02:23:07,334
This is our family matter...
you don't have to interfere.

2480
02:23:07,376 --> 02:23:08,417
Our family matter?

2481
02:23:09,709 --> 02:23:11,167
Aren't they my children too?

2482
02:23:11,917 --> 02:23:13,292
Don't I have any right to them?

2483
02:23:13,334 --> 02:23:15,209
Forget it, uncle.
- Forget it, uncle.

2484
02:23:15,251 --> 02:23:16,167
Quiet!

2485
02:23:16,834 --> 02:23:17,751
Absolutely quiet.

2486
02:23:21,001 --> 02:23:22,001
Son...

2487
02:23:24,876 --> 02:23:26,167
It's close to 11 o'clock.

2488
02:23:27,501 --> 02:23:28,542
When will this end?

2489
02:23:29,959 --> 02:23:31,334
It's just getting started.

2490
02:23:31,376 --> 02:23:32,709
Have you lost your mind, brother?

2491
02:23:33,167 --> 02:23:34,501
Always yelling at me!

2492
02:23:35,042 --> 02:23:36,376
You did the right thing, sister...

2493
02:23:36,542 --> 02:23:37,959
...by severing all ties with him!

2494
02:23:39,292 --> 02:23:42,501
A brother who can humiliate
his sister, challenge her...

2495
02:23:42,584 --> 02:23:45,001
...a cheap man like that
isn't worthy... - Shut up!

2496
02:23:49,876 --> 02:23:54,542
Kartar...if you say another
word about Baldev... - Enough!

2497
02:23:58,167 --> 02:24:02,584
He can say anything...
you can do anything...

2498
02:24:03,501 --> 02:24:07,459
Do you have any idea...
how arrogant you are?

2499
02:24:08,001 --> 02:24:09,459
How stubborn are you?

2500
02:24:09,834 --> 02:24:12,751
And you've such a
small heart and thinking.

2501
02:24:14,126 --> 02:24:16,584
I wish God doesn't bless
anyone with a sister like you.

2502
02:24:24,417 --> 02:24:26,334
How dare you misbehave
with our sister...

2503
02:24:26,376 --> 02:24:27,876
...who raised us like her children.

2504
02:24:38,209 --> 02:24:39,334
See Sandhu sir...

2505
02:24:41,001 --> 02:24:44,834
Yell at the sister,
and the brother slaps you.

2506
02:24:45,209 --> 02:24:48,334
Yell at the brother,
and the sister hits back.

2507
02:24:48,459 --> 02:24:49,459
Why?

2508
02:24:51,792 --> 02:24:53,626
Because they are each other's life...

2509
02:24:57,334 --> 02:24:59,001
...but they are not
ready to accept it.

2510
02:25:00,209 --> 02:25:05,876
Because they have erected
a wall of ego between them.

2511
02:25:09,792 --> 02:25:11,667
We used to fight when we were kids.

2512
02:25:12,792 --> 02:25:15,292
For books, toys...

2513
02:25:16,542 --> 02:25:18,542
It was either for this or for that.

2514
02:25:20,334 --> 02:25:22,542
But we never went separated like this.

2515
02:25:26,542 --> 02:25:30,417
It's better to be a kid
for the rest of our lives...

2516
02:25:31,417 --> 02:25:34,501
...then growing up like this.

2517
02:25:36,626 --> 02:25:41,459
Brother, you revered sister like God.

2518
02:25:42,709 --> 02:25:46,626
But you turned your back
on your God over a trivial thing.

2519
02:25:46,667 --> 02:25:48,251
No...

2520
02:25:50,501 --> 02:25:51,751
And sister...

2521
02:25:52,542 --> 02:25:55,667
...you raised brother
Baldev like a mother.

2522
02:25:57,459 --> 02:26:00,126
So how can any mother
severe ties with her children?

2523
02:26:04,376 --> 02:26:06,251
Life is too short.

2524
02:26:06,959 --> 02:26:08,042
Too short.

2525
02:26:08,709 --> 02:26:12,709
And we develop such
big egos in this small life.

2526
02:26:16,417 --> 02:26:18,126
You can slap me 100 times more...

2527
02:26:18,251 --> 02:26:20,251
You're my elders, you can.
- No.

2528
02:26:20,334 --> 02:26:22,459
But forsake this stubbornness,
this ego...

2529
02:26:23,001 --> 02:26:27,584
End this war... or it will
be the end of your Kartar.

2530
02:26:28,084 --> 02:26:31,501
Forgive me, sister.
- Ballu...

2531
02:26:32,376 --> 02:26:33,626
No...

2532
02:26:44,959 --> 02:26:45,959
Forgive me.

2533
02:26:46,001 --> 02:26:49,376
You forgive me. You're my brother...

2534
02:26:50,376 --> 02:26:52,042
Come here, Kartar.

2535
02:26:53,709 --> 02:26:55,417
Forgive me...

2536
02:26:59,376 --> 02:27:00,542
Fantastic, uncle...

2537
02:27:00,876 --> 02:27:03,626
You're doing such a great time...

2538
02:27:04,209 --> 02:27:07,584
But your timing is so bad!

2539
02:27:09,542 --> 02:27:10,417
Sandhu sir...

2540
02:27:12,251 --> 02:27:15,167
Charan doesn't do drugs.

2541
02:27:16,667 --> 02:27:20,042
I made everyone believe he did drugs.

2542
02:27:22,292 --> 02:27:25,292
Daddy, he's right.
charan doesn't take drugs.

2543
02:27:25,542 --> 02:27:26,876
He's not like Happy.

2544
02:27:29,751 --> 02:27:30,834
Baldev...

2545
02:27:31,626 --> 02:27:34,459
I misbehaved due to
all this misconception.

2546
02:27:36,042 --> 02:27:37,209
Forgive me.

2547
02:27:38,209 --> 02:27:39,584
I called you a hawker.

2548
02:27:39,834 --> 02:27:43,459
Sandhu sir...I forgive you...
let's not get into details.

2549
02:27:45,417 --> 02:27:47,751
Everything's fine...

2550
02:27:47,876 --> 02:27:50,417
charan. Come stand next
to your Binkle. - come on.

2551
02:27:50,459 --> 02:27:51,167
Come, my boy.

2552
02:27:51,501 --> 02:27:54,084
Karan, Sweety's waiting. Come on.

2553
02:27:54,209 --> 02:27:55,459
Go on...

2554
02:27:57,001 --> 02:27:58,292
Now what's the problem?

2555
02:27:58,459 --> 02:27:59,459
It's almost 11 o' clock.

2556
02:27:59,876 --> 02:28:00,667
They have patched up.

2557
02:28:00,876 --> 02:28:01,584
How can we patch up?

2558
02:28:01,626 --> 02:28:02,876
How can Papa just patch up like this?

2559
02:28:02,917 --> 02:28:03,876
There's been no patch up.

2560
02:28:04,084 --> 02:28:05,876
You idiot,
they have patched up for good...

2561
02:28:05,917 --> 02:28:06,959
...and you're making a mess again.

2562
02:28:07,042 --> 02:28:11,542
There's been no patch up,
he called... my father a hawker.

2563
02:28:11,834 --> 02:28:15,042
Hey...don't keep repeating that.

2564
02:28:15,209 --> 02:28:16,834
Why are you going in flashback?

2565
02:28:17,542 --> 02:28:19,584
I want to marry Sweety, that's all.

2566
02:28:19,626 --> 02:28:20,792
What?

2567
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:22,501
What do you say, Karan?

2568
02:28:23,167 --> 02:28:23,917
Karan?

2569
02:28:24,126 --> 02:28:24,917
Karan.

2570
02:28:26,042 --> 02:28:28,209
Karan.
- Yeah...Karan...

2571
02:28:28,459 --> 02:28:31,292
I am Karan.
And I want to marry Binkle.

2572
02:28:31,542 --> 02:28:33,917
Why are you creating
a new problem now?

2573
02:28:34,167 --> 02:28:36,251
We've patched up now, so why...
- Son, please.

2574
02:28:36,292 --> 02:28:38,084
It's almost 11 o'clock.

2575
02:28:39,501 --> 02:28:40,959
Who's booking is it first?

2576
02:28:41,417 --> 02:28:43,501
These are the only two weddings today.

2577
02:28:44,417 --> 02:28:48,417
Then what's the hurry?
- I am free...

2578
02:28:49,001 --> 02:28:52,376
Just settle this quickly and be there.

2579
02:28:56,459 --> 02:28:59,209
Uncle...we need to talk to you.
- Then say it.

2580
02:28:59,459 --> 02:29:01,417
Alone.
- Alone?

2581
02:29:01,459 --> 02:29:03,084
What?
- I'll be right back. - Go...

2582
02:29:03,126 --> 02:29:04,042
Brother.
Come on...

2583
02:29:04,334 --> 02:29:05,709
Follow me...follow me.

2584
02:29:05,751 --> 02:29:07,459
Give way, give way, move-move-move.

2585
02:29:08,167 --> 02:29:10,167
Sister, what is it now?

2586
02:29:14,584 --> 02:29:17,042
Speak up, what's the problem?

2587
02:29:24,626 --> 02:29:27,251
Karan? You were dressed as charan.

2588
02:29:28,001 --> 02:29:29,584
What were you two going to do?

2589
02:29:32,251 --> 02:29:33,459
Such a big deceit.

2590
02:29:33,917 --> 02:29:35,126
Are you mad, Karan?

2591
02:29:35,209 --> 02:29:36,959
Uncle, aren't you tired yet?

2592
02:29:37,209 --> 02:29:39,334
You gave such a big speech out there.

2593
02:29:39,751 --> 02:29:41,751
And anyway...this isn't my idea...

2594
02:29:41,792 --> 02:29:44,209
...it was your beloved Charan's idea.

2595
02:29:49,709 --> 02:29:50,542
Take your clothes off.

2596
02:29:51,792 --> 02:29:54,542
Exchange your suits.
- Yes.

2597
02:29:54,917 --> 02:29:57,917
And don't ever tell
your wife's about this.

2598
02:29:58,417 --> 02:30:02,501
A wife...even doubts her own husband.

2599
02:30:03,542 --> 02:30:09,167
You fools...if you had
gone ahead with this lie...

2600
02:30:09,584 --> 02:30:11,709
Then for the rest of your lives...

2601
02:30:12,042 --> 02:30:13,626
...she will never
believe a word you say.

2602
02:30:14,459 --> 02:30:16,126
come on, change your dresses.

2603
02:30:16,376 --> 02:30:18,376
congratulations! Congratulations!

2604
02:30:18,417 --> 02:30:20,959
The children are ready to get married.
- Are they ready...Thank God.

2605
02:30:21,001 --> 02:30:23,917
Give way to my boy, move-move-move.

2606
02:30:24,084 --> 02:30:25,126
Is the wedding still on?
- Yes.

2607
02:30:25,167 --> 02:30:26,209
But who's marrying whom?

2608
02:30:26,709 --> 02:30:28,209
Karan's marrying Sweety, and
Charan's marrying Binkle. - I see...

2609
02:30:28,251 --> 02:30:29,667
You all asked Sandhu sir,
but no one asked me.

2610
02:30:29,709 --> 02:30:30,959
We will after the wedding.

2611
02:30:31,084 --> 02:30:32,542
Give me your card.
- Take it...

2612
02:30:32,584 --> 02:30:33,542
If the children are happy, I am happy.

2613
02:30:33,584 --> 02:30:36,917
crazy boy, couldn't you
tell us before that you like her?

2614
02:30:37,209 --> 02:30:40,501
Come on...
Time for the wedding.

2615
02:30:41,542 --> 02:30:45,417
Why did you say no?
- No, I didn't...

2616
02:30:45,709 --> 02:30:49,167
A guy who can sacrifice
his love for his family...

2617
02:30:49,709 --> 02:30:51,126
He must be really special.

2618
02:30:53,751 --> 02:30:56,209
Sweet...I love you...

2619
02:30:56,251 --> 02:30:59,167
I love you, I love you, I love you.
- Gill sir.

2620
02:30:59,876 --> 02:31:00,917
Let's get married first.

2621
02:31:10,917 --> 02:31:13,042
Start cameras.

2622
02:31:13,084 --> 02:31:14,751
Action.

2623
02:31:14,876 --> 02:31:17,292
Clap. It's clap.
- So much energy.

2624
02:31:18,084 --> 02:31:20,792
So much energy we'll collapse on sets.

2625
02:31:21,417 --> 02:31:22,167
Yes.

2626
02:31:22,209 --> 02:31:24,084
"It's Party night... cheers..."

2627
02:31:28,292 --> 02:31:29,292
"Drop the beat..."

2628
02:31:33,542 --> 02:31:37,084
Everybody is very happy
and work is doing great.

2629
02:31:40,501 --> 02:31:43,084
Sweety is like superb. Hot.

2630
02:31:47,626 --> 02:31:49,542
Take sir. Take sir.

2631
02:31:49,667 --> 02:31:52,209
No, no. He is a salesman.

2632
02:32:08,084 --> 02:32:08,626
"Let's go."

2633
02:32:08,709 --> 02:32:11,001
You love me so much, dude.

2634
02:32:11,292 --> 02:32:12,459
He knows everything.

2635
02:32:14,167 --> 02:32:16,542
" cheers...to this great evening..."

2636
02:32:16,584 --> 02:32:18,709
"cheers...for this joy."

2637
02:32:18,834 --> 02:32:20,709
"Cheers to my friends..."

2638
02:32:20,792 --> 02:32:23,209
"cheers... Cheers to them all..."

2639
02:32:23,251 --> 02:32:25,584
" cheers...to this great evening..."

2640
02:32:25,626 --> 02:32:27,751
"cheers...for this joy."

2641
02:32:27,876 --> 02:32:29,792
"Cheers to my friends..."

2642
02:32:29,917 --> 02:32:31,417
"cheers... Cheers to them all..."

2643
02:32:31,501 --> 02:32:33,251
He is not even told about Charan...

2644
02:32:33,292 --> 02:32:34,876
No, that's not right.

2645
02:32:34,917 --> 02:32:37,626
Nafisha. No.
We have to many charecters.

2646
02:32:37,667 --> 02:32:39,751
"We're going to celebrate tonight."

2647
02:32:39,917 --> 02:32:42,126
"We're not going to wait."

2648
02:32:42,167 --> 02:32:44,292
"We're going to dance
the old-fashioned way..."

2649
02:32:44,334 --> 02:32:46,709
"...and create a new step."

2650
02:32:47,001 --> 02:32:48,292
Stop asking.

2651
02:32:50,667 --> 02:32:52,709
"Come and dance with me..."

2652
02:32:52,792 --> 02:32:54,834
"come and ask...how I am..."

2653
02:32:54,876 --> 02:32:57,459
"Dance and sway with me..."

2654
02:32:57,501 --> 02:33:00,042
"...with my hands around your waist."

2655
02:33:00,126 --> 02:33:01,459
It's called 'Purani Haveli'.

2656
02:33:03,292 --> 02:33:05,834
Sorry. You have done good job.

2657
02:33:06,751 --> 02:33:08,167
"congratulations..."

2658
02:33:09,001 --> 02:33:10,417
"congratulations..."

2659
02:33:11,334 --> 02:33:12,459
"congratulations..."

2660
02:33:12,501 --> 02:33:14,084
"It's Party night... cheers..."

2661
02:33:14,584 --> 02:33:17,292
"It's Party night... cheers..."

2662
02:33:19,084 --> 02:33:21,751
"It's Party night... cheers..."

2663
02:33:32,584 --> 02:33:34,417
Recognise the man.

2664
02:33:35,001 --> 02:33:35,917
Do you know me?

2665
02:33:35,959 --> 02:33:38,667
"I don't know how to...
dance and sway."

2666
02:33:38,709 --> 02:33:40,834
"I don't touch alcohol either."

2667
02:33:41,001 --> 02:33:45,501
"But after two pegs down...
and no one can dance like me.

2668
02:33:45,751 --> 02:33:48,084
"I am Badshah...by my queen."

2669
02:33:48,126 --> 02:33:50,292
"Your attitude...is very mean, baby."

2670
02:33:50,334 --> 02:33:52,084
"Do you understand...what
I mean baby..."

2671
02:33:52,126 --> 02:33:54,251
"Let me make your night awesome."

2672
02:33:54,292 --> 02:33:56,084
"Increase the speed of your sway."

2673
02:33:56,251 --> 02:33:58,417
"Because the beat is fantastic."

2674
02:33:58,542 --> 02:34:00,751
"Watching me sway my hips..."

2675
02:34:00,792 --> 02:34:03,417
"...blows their minds away."

2676
02:34:03,584 --> 02:34:05,667
"Your gait's...enthralling."

2677
02:34:05,709 --> 02:34:07,542
"I'm getting some bad...intentions."

2678
02:34:07,584 --> 02:34:10,292
"I want to spend all night with you."

2679
02:34:10,334 --> 02:34:13,209
"Don't mind...sweetheart."

2680
02:34:22,459 --> 02:34:23,876
"congratulations..."

2681
02:34:24,709 --> 02:34:25,917
"congratulations..."

2682
02:34:26,959 --> 02:34:27,876
"congratulations..."

2683
02:34:27,917 --> 02:34:30,084
"It's Party night... Cheers..."

2684
02:34:30,209 --> 02:34:31,667
My dad...

2685
02:34:39,084 --> 02:34:43,542
"It's Party night... Cheers..."

2686
02:34:43,626 --> 02:34:45,876
"It's Party night... Cheers..."

2687
02:34:45,917 --> 02:34:47,376
"It's Party night..."

2688
02:34:49,667 --> 02:34:51,834
"Let's go."

2689
02:34:51,917 --> 02:34:54,084
"Let's go."

2690
02:34:55,334 --> 02:34:57,709
"Whoever utters shall be happy,
shall be fulfilled,"

2691
02:34:57,792 --> 02:34:59,959
"Great Timeless Lord"

2692
02:35:03,834 --> 02:35:05,376
"congratulations..."
