1
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,250
'That's Shinda.'

2
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,208
'His parents passed
away soon after his birth.'

3
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,791
'Leaving this
three-legged cot for him.'

4
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,416
'Burdened with poverty,
he sleeps a lot these days.'

5
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,625
Wake up, Shinda.

6
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,583
Wake up, son.

7
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,500
What is wrong, uncle?

8
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,333
Today is the last day
to get the yellow card made.

9
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,375
Go and get it.

10
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,875
Yes, I will.

11
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,791
It's already 11 am.
When do you plan to go?

12
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,541
- It's 11 am?
- Yes.

13
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,375
Oh no, 11 missed calls!

14
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,041
I was supposed to
meet Lali's father today.

15
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,583
'Your call cannot connect
because of insufficient balance.'

16
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,208
Fine, I'll call from uncle's phone.

17
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,208
Give me your phone, uncle.

18
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,375
- Hello?
- Lali, it's Shinda.

19
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,416
Where are you?
Daddy's waiting for you.

20
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I just woke up.

21
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,833
At 11 am?

22
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,541
Quickly get ready and come home.

23
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,875
Can we reschedule it for tomorrow?

24
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,000
Today is the last day
to get the yellow card made.

25
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,708
Yellow card? What's that?

26
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,875
It's for people under poverty line.

27
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,416
We will get everything
for free after we get married.

28
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,041
Just send me a good picture
of your in old worn out clothes.

29
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,750
- Why?
- It's made for the ladies.

30
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,208
I'll get your card made
even before we get married.

31
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,708
Have some shame, Shinda.

32
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,416
You are getting excited like
you are getting me a green card.

33
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,666
What should I tell my father you do?

34
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,291
I am just to make
a bright future for us.

35
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,375
Hurry up.

36
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,416
My girl will get suspicious
when she will check my calls.

37
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,291
Lali, call me back on my phone.
I don't have any talktime left.

38
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,291
You have nothing that
one needs in a husband.

39
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,250
I should better find someone else.

40
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,291
Lali! Hello? Lali?

41
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,708
What? She insulted you?

42
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:37,708
A little.

43
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,333
Uncle, how will I ever get married?

44
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,500
First delete this girl's
number from my phone.

45
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,541
If your aunt finds out
then I won't have a wife either.

46
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,250
Here uncle,
try to save your marriage.

47
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,875
Go. What are you waiting for, tea?

48
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,833
Tea is being made for last 10 years.

49
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,125
You keep getting
upset over small things.

50
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,458
Let me be somebody
before I meet your daddy.

51
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,166
I have been hearing
that since two years.

52
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,375
What have you done so far?

53
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,291
I went from a tea
stall to a mobile stall.

54
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,583
How is that progress?

55
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,291
You will never be happy
when someone progresses.

56
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,083
That is the reason Salman
Khan doesn't get married.

57
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,500
He thinks after he gets
married his wife will say

58
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,416
"So what if a few hundred
million people know you?"

59
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,625
Let's stick to you here.

60
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,500
What's the difference between
a tea stall and a mobile stall?

61
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,750
There is a lot of difference.
Sit down.

62
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,875
First of all,
my clothes no longer get dirty.

63
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,625
Secondly, Airtel,
Jio, Vodafone, and the kind..

64
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,791
They all request
me to sell their things.

65
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:35,500
You will see, one day Shinda
Jatt will be so famous that..

66
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,375
..your father will
come to you and ask you..

67
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,458
..how do you like that mobile guy?

68
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,791
And I would say.. I hate him.

69
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,375
Whenever I want you
to meet your father..

70
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,166
..you make some excuse
and send me away.

71
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,625
Why don't you say that
you are not serious about me.

72
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,833
You don't want to marry me.

73
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,333
Why are you so sad?

74
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,416
Try to understand, there
is a big difference between us.

75
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,416
How do I face your father?

76
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,333
Balli is talking to a few companies.

77
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,916
We will soon get an
agency of a Chinese phone.

78
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,625
Then I will come
to meet your father.

79
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,000
You are seeking Balli's
help to become successful?

80
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,083
Balli is seeking my
help to become successful.

81
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,500
Look, I know he works
more but I am smarter.

82
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,083
You know how smart he is.

83
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,041
Then why did you make
"your father" your partner?

84
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,708
Father's have a right, don't they?

85
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,791
Don't try to twist my words.

86
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,791
Give me some more time.

87
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,875
I have a feeling that something
big is about to happen.

88
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,916
I'll quickly set up a good
business and approach your father.

89
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,833
I'll go and get Balli.

90
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,541
He must be waiting for me.
We need to open our stall.

91
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,625
You open your stall at 12 pm.

92
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,875
We are the boss.

93
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,541
I am just joking.

94
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,291
Balli does another job.

95
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,625
I have to go and relieve him.

96
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,458
Here, enjoy your meal.

97
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,416
Potatoes again?

98
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,083
You know that she
isn't keeping well.

99
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,083
You cannot get her
the right treatment..

100
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,500
..so at least feed her right.

101
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,291
Potatoes are good for health.

102
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,541
You don't like them
because they are cheap.

103
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,750
If they become expensive..

104
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,000
..then people will start talking.

105
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,750
"Balli served potatoes again!"

106
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,375
That's it. Please forgive me.

107
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,791
Doctor asked us to
give her green vegetables.

108
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,708
What's that green cabbage called?

109
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,416
- Bruce Lee.
- Yes.

110
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,375
Have you ever given her that?

111
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,541
I had once seen it in the city.

112
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,916
When I asked for its price..

113
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,458
..I learnt that we cannot
even afford to see it.

114
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,750
Gurmeet, I too love
Simran as much as you do.

115
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,875
I try my best to get her treated.

116
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,375
I'll make arrangements
for the money any way I can.

117
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,750
Let's go, Balli.

118
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,291
You can do household
work in the evening.

119
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,625
Coming, Shinda.

120
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,333
I'll leave now to open the stall.

121
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,000
Trust me, we will get her treated.

122
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,833
Bye, dear. See you.

123
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,166
Why don't you come on time?

124
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,083
My wife was massaging my feet.

125
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,333
I said you can do that at night.

126
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,458
She will strangle
you if she hears that.

127
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,041
Oh no.

128
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,083
I am out of fuel.

129
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,541
Hello!

130
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,833
- Who are you talking to?
- Your grandfather.

131
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,000
Why didn't he also get a fuel pump
for you along with the motorbike?

132
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,875
I have some fuel.

133
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,875
That one you stole
from Seth's scooter?

134
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,750
Right. My grandfather's motorbike
has turned me into a thief.

135
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,250
- Hello, Seth.
- Hello.

136
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,083
Why don't you come early?

137
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,333
In the cities,
showrooms open by 11 am.

138
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,708
- That early?
- Yes.

139
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,625
You too should open
our showroom early.

140
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,166
Okay. Sweep the place.

141
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,916
- Shinda?
- Yes?

142
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,583
Someone stole our broom.

143
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,625
This village is full of thieves.

144
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,791
Are you talking about me?

145
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,666
No Sethji, I wouldn't dare.

146
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,083
May we borrow your broom?

147
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes, and let's talk
after you are done sweeping.

148
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,291
About the aunt who was
asking for your phone number?

149
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,625
No, she called me already.

150
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,708
Let's talk after
you are done sweeping.

151
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,625
You have me worried.
First, tell me what is this about.

152
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,708
Fine, sit down.

153
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,458
I have decided to sell this shop.

154
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,750
I want to sell this and
invest in a store in the city.

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,916
Seth, just because we
didn't pay two months' rent..

156
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,500
..you are looking for
excuses to make us move?

157
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,541
We will pay you the rent.
We aren't running away.

158
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,000
We have barely started our work.

159
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,875
Try to understand, Shinda.

160
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,666
Otherwise, my work will get stuck.

161
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,458
Are you sweeping his shop?

162
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,541
What are you doing
here sitting all dejected?

163
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,250
Do I have to sweep
the place every day?

164
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,666
Look Shinda,
both of you are like sons to me.

165
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,541
If doesn't make a difference to me..

166
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,666
..whether or not you
pay me the pending rent.

167
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,041
But I will have to sell this shop.

168
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,125
One more thing.

169
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,375
The one who might
purchase this shop..

170
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,875
..might not let you
keep your stall here.

171
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,250
You should make arrangements
for that as well.

172
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,583
Sit down, don't fall on me.

173
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,125
Sethji, we will be
on the streets then.

174
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,333
- I am helpless, Balli.
- Hello, Sethji.

175
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,500
- Hello.
- We want to arrange a Ramleela.

176
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,750
- In my shop?
- No, at the Ramleela ground.

177
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:47,833
We are here to give donation slips.

178
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,875
Don't give me a slip,
I'll come there and donate.

179
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,125
What about you?

180
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,916
I'll come with him
and seek blessings.

181
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,375
Yeah, right!

182
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,291
- Seth?
- Yes?

183
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,375
Give us some time,
we will purchase your shop.

184
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,708
You cannot even manage pay the rent.

185
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,333
How will you get Rs. 250,000?

186
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,833
- We will do something.
- Yes.

187
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,583
Did you read today's newspaper?

188
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,458
People are doing frauds
worth 500 millions rupees.

189
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,083
And you seek time to pay Rs.
250,000?

190
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,416
Anyway, you initiated this.

191
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,500
Try to arrange for Rs. 250,000.

192
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,500
Look at the newspaper
sometimes, SHO!

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,791
It's been 7 days
since Sukhchan escaped.

194
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,625
You are still hunting for clues?

195
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,583
Sir, the entire force
is working at it.

196
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,791
We will surely find a clue.

197
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,833
You should have arrested him by now.

198
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,833
You know the pressure I am facing?

199
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,625
500 million fraud is a big deal.

200
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,833
This is not longer
restricted to your office.

201
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,416
It has reached the CM's office.

202
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,708
Sir, Sukhchan must
have not left our area.

203
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:47,750
I will find him, sir.

204
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,041
As soon as possible.

205
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,500
Otherwise, you will find a letter
on your table after four days.

206
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,833
Your transfer letter.

207
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:53,708
Now get out.

208
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,416
Sir.

209
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,583
- Baint Singh?
- Yes, sir?

210
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,750
Drop everything else
and find Sukhchan.

211
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,041
- Yes, sir.
- Sir, I told you..

212
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,083
..we should solve
Sukhchan's case first.

213
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,458
You are the one who said..

214
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,000
..we want to send our
kids to an expensive school.

215
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,208
So, we should put
up some check posts.

216
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,333
You should have been a woman.

217
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,666
You mean a lady constable?

218
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,875
- We will all get transferred.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,375
- Use everyone in the police station
to look for Sukhchan. - Yes, sir.

220
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,750
- Got it?
- Okay, sir.

221
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,708
Why do you look so sad?

222
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,291
Did anything go wrong?

223
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,916
No, what could go wrong?

224
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,291
This is how we look, Khundi.

225
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,541
Tell me about yourself,
you doing good?

226
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,791
What good?

227
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,666
I have dislocated my shoulder.

228
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,750
Dr. Khan has asked me to
not to carry a gun for a few days.

229
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,541
Manager doesn't want
the gun off my shoulder.

230
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,333
Bank needs security after all.

231
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,458
What security?

232
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,750
I used to be a peon.

233
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,791
They gave me a gun 3 years ago.

234
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,250
They said you just need to carry it.
No one is going to rob this place.

235
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,083
This means if someone
tries to rob a bank..

236
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,791
You don't even know how to shoot?

237
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,625
No, carry it on the
shoulder is enough.

238
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,458
No one is going to rob a bank here.

239
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,458
Come on! So you are like the
scarecrow they use in the fields.

240
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,041
Something like that.

241
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,416
I used to get Rs. 8,000 as a peon.

242
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,250
They gave me a raise of Rs. 2000.

243
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,500
They asked me to carry this gun.

244
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,250
It has benefited me.

245
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,541
I carry a gun and
offer tea to others.

246
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,916
He is better than us.

247
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,625
He makes Rs. 10,000 a month.

248
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,625
Machi, put it on tab.

249
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,250
- Shinda?
- Yes.

250
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,041
Don't tell anyone in the village
that I don't know how to shoot a gun.

251
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,375
Fine, we won't.

252
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,416
Meshi?

253
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,333
You too don't tell anyone.

254
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,583
Everyone in the village knows
that they shouldn't tell anyone.

255
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,416
Right.

256
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,750
"You have cat eyes
and chubby cheeks."

257
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,833
"Your body talks to me."

258
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,291
Who is it?

259
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,416
Hello?

260
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,750
Good morning, sir.

261
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,916
Good morning. Who is it?

262
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,250
Sir, this is Aditi
from Davindra Holiday Club.

263
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,583
We are offering you a 5 Nights
and 6 days free trip to Singapore.

264
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,000
Why's the occasion?

265
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,375
- What?
- Yes.

266
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,458
Can you tell us how much
income tax do you pay, sir?

267
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,666
I don't pay any income tax.
I hold a yellow card.

268
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,833
What is that?

269
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,875
Those who don't have
food to eat get this.

270
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,333
Okay tell me, how much money do
you spend over a person's holiday?

271
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,333
On an average 2,50,000 per couple.

272
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,416
I'll be damned.

273
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,625
Then why don't you give
me this money directly?

274
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,666
I'll buy a shop for myself.

275
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,083
Good sense of humour, sir.

276
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,416
Sir, are you salaried
or self-employed?

277
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,750
We are Kangs, we are Jatts.

278
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,875
I am asking you about your work,
sir. What work do you do, sir?

279
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,041
Oh! I have a mobile stall.

280
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,625
I repair mobiles. I also.. hello?

281
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:55,916
Hello?

282
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,291
Hello, Aditi?

283
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,416
It got disconnected.

284
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,791
What is this?

285
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,083
It's AC got burnt.

286
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,000
We will need to get
a new one from the city.

287
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,666
God, I feel like cursing you.

288
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,125
I had just one phone
and that too got ruined.

289
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,583
Don't we have any other mobile?

290
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,458
We have a few of our clients. They
can come any time to collect it.

291
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,250
We can put two sims
in your mobile, right?

292
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,666
- Yes.
- Put my sim in it.

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,250
- And Balli, my bed..
- The broken one?

294
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,708
Yes. It broke some more.

295
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,166
You should curse
God for two minutes.

296
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,500
You will feel better.

297
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,625
- Yes.
- Shinda!

298
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,291
You are always busy working.

299
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,041
How about thinking
about God too sometimes?

300
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,291
I was just about to.

301
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,791
What can I do for you?

302
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,333
Ramleela is just around the corner.

303
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,208
You still didn't give any donation.

304
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,291
- Look brother!
- Yes.

305
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,833
I can be Sugreev in the play.
But I cannot give any donation.

306
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,000
Get going.

307
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,458
- It is done?
- It is working.

308
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,041
Now you assume that your
phone got water damaged.

309
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,333
I am joking.

310
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:05,791
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:12,500
Sir, we can beat anyone into
confessing that he is Sukhchan.

312
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,708
It will save our skin.

313
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,041
And what about the 500 million?

314
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,666
- What will we say where did it go?
- We'll say we found him by the river.

315
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,500
Money got carried away in the water.

316
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,000
How did you get this job?

317
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,750
My father passed away.

318
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,291
I got his job.

319
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,208
- Oh, I see. That's why.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,208
Go and get me tea.

321
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,250
Go.

322
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,000
Who is it?

323
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,041
Keep driving.
It shows Janu calling. My wife.

324
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,666
I have saved my
girlfriend also as Janu.

325
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,125
- What do I do now?
- Put it on speaker.

326
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,250
Hello? Where are you, Shinda?

327
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,625
- Yours.
- Mine.

328
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,583
I am in the village, Lali.
What happened?

329
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,708
You know the manager
of the bank in your village?

330
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,333
Yes! Is he dead?

331
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,458
No. I have got a marriage
proposal from him.

332
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,416
He holds a government job.
Daddy likes him as well.

333
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,125
You can keep loitering
with that idler Balli.

334
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,541
Lali, I am about to buy the shop
outside which I set up my stall.

335
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,791
I'll come to meet your father
as soon as the deal is finalised.

336
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,625
When? After my marriage?

337
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,750
I should have something
to say to your father.

338
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,375
Give me just a few more days.

339
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,333
You know I can't
say much to my father.

340
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,750
You do as you feel right.

341
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm hanging up now.

342
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,625
Shinda, my wife has two bangles.

343
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,166
Let's sell them and get the shop.

344
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,333
What are you saying?

345
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,708
Simran is unwell.

346
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,708
You might need them.

347
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,500
But the shop is important as well.

348
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,625
We will solve this issue.

349
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,291
Hop on, let's find a solution.

350
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,333
- Sir, we have arranged for the money.
- Oh really?

351
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,208
We'll give it to you
as soon as we get the money.

352
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,750
- So from now, this shop is ours.
- Congratulations.

353
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,875
Hey! What is this nonsense?

354
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,875
No advance or documentation.

355
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,291
How is this shop yours now?

356
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,541
How much advance are you giving me?

357
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,666
How much do you want?

358
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,000
According to the usual 25%
it comes to around Rs. 72,500.

359
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,416
But I know you guys, so
you tell me how much can you give?

360
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,416
If you are being so considerate
then be a little more considerate.

361
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,750
We will pay the
whole amount together.

362
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,916
Oh no. I have always said yes
to someone in the city.

363
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,875
I won't be able to say no to them.

364
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,625
He's taking a u-turn.

365
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't get angry, sir.

366
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,333
Tell me,
how much should we give you?

367
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,583
Give whatever you can,
we will handle it.

368
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,833
Shinda, he is just polite,
he won't move an inch.

369
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:43,000
Whatever, but we will have to give him
something. Otherwise, he will say no.

370
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,916
- How much money do you have?
- I have..

371
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,750
Rs. 500..

372
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,291
Rs. 620..

373
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,750
Rs. 720.

374
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,166
From where did you
get so much money?

375
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,333
Forget that.

376
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,583
Your 720 plus this, we have 790 now.

377
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,541
We cannot give him
all the money we have.

378
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,375
We give 1000 rupees
as two months' rent.

379
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,375
And we will give only
790 as an advance for the shop?

380
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,333
At least talk to him.

381
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,625
Don't bother.

382
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,625
I will get it handled
in the village itself.

383
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,333
Yes?

384
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,625
This is great.

385
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,500
- Congratulations.
- How much is it?

386
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,333
Rs. 790.

387
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,625
We will give the balance as and
when in small instalments of 100s.

388
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,666
Quickly.

389
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,291
Take this.

390
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,750
Have you ever heard me curse?

391
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,833
You will, today. Scoundrels!

392
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,500
You are supposed to give Rs. 72,500.

393
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,208
You could have given Rs. 50,000.

394
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,333
You could have given Rs. 40,000.

395
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,666
What kind of a joke is this?

396
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,125
Sir, Jatts and Baniyas
don't get along.

397
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,250
There are so many
stories about this.

398
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,458
You can prove all those
stories wrong today.

399
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,416
You can create history.

400
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,375
By giving a hug to this Jatt.

401
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,791
We will become one life.

402
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,875
Can you give all
the money in five days?

403
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,291
In seven days?

404
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,250
It will be difficult.

405
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,291
I'll be considerate with you, can
you give all the money in 15 days?

406
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,375
Yes.

407
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,416
I am getting Rs.
2,50,000 right away.

408
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,208
Don't complain on the 16th day that
I gave the shop to someone else.

409
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,416
- Clear?
- Clear.

410
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,625
All set? All good?

411
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,875
- How are you, Khundi?
- Good, brother.

412
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,541
What brings you to the bank?

413
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,833
We have come to rob it.

414
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,791
Go ahead. That will give
me a chance to check my gun.

415
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,166
We have come to take a loan,
brother. Don't shoot us.

416
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,375
- Hurry up.
- Ms. Pushpa.

417
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,166
Does your husband still hit you?

418
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,166
Times have changed.

419
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,708
- Now I hit him.
- That's good.

420
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,916
Complete the file.

421
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,791
Auntie, we want a loan.

422
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:47,791
Have some shame.

423
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,875
I must be a few years
younger than you.

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Kiddo, we want a loan.

425
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,125
Go and talk to the manager.

426
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,750
I don't want to talk to him.

427
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,750
You give it to me.

428
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,166
You will have to talk
to the manager about the loan.

429
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,166
Go inside.

430
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,166
Hello.

431
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,208
How can I help you?

432
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,666
We want to...

433
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,583
We need a loan of 250,000 rupees.

434
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,541
What work do you do?

435
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,291
We repair mobile phones.

436
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,666
What's your ITR?

437
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,625
We don't do the
things rich people do.

438
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,083
I am talking about income tax.

439
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,125
Do you play tax?

440
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,500
Why would we seek a
loan if we had any income?

441
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,166
But one thing's for sure.

442
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,250
If my girlfriend leaves
me and marries someone else..

443
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,250
..then too she will
come back only to me.

444
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,625
What does this have
to do with the loan?

445
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,041
Do you have any agricultural land?

446
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,375
Then on what behalf
should we give you a loan?

447
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,083
Bank should have a guarantee
that it will get its money back.

448
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,750
Okay.

449
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,666
We can go to the
Gurudwara and promise.

450
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,333
Promises won't give you a loan.

451
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,666
Let's talk if you
have any documents.

452
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,791
Otherwise, you may leave.

453
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,000
Go.

454
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,125
Let's go.

455
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,875
Did they come here to
take a loan or to scare me?

456
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,291
How much loan do you want?

457
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,541
250,000 rupees.

458
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,875
250,000 rupees?

459
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,166
Do you want to shut this bank down?

460
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,125
250,000 rupees is the
total amount bank has.

461
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,166
If we will give you all the money what
will we do in there, play monopoly?

462
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,541
Then this is a useless bank.

463
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,833
Brother, small banks
only get small deposits.

464
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,375
Just imagine why would
they give a peon a gun?

465
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,166
Because there is
nothing in the bank.

466
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,708
Then why are you
carrying the burden?

467
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,416
You are just hurting your shoulder.

468
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,791
It is a rule.

469
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,666
Whether or not there
is anything in the bank..

470
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,083
..there has to be
security guard outside it.

471
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,291
Even the gun must be wondering
what am I doing in a bank.

472
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:49,041
If it has been at a Jatt's
place it would get fired every day.

473
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,125
Like firecrackers!

474
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,791
That reminds me,
I took it at home for Diwali.

475
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,708
I thought I'd shoot
if before my kids.

476
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,333
The trigger got stuck
when I tried to shoot.

477
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,208
I came here and told the manager.

478
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,750
He said it will cost 3300,
use your salary and get it repaired.

479
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,333
I thought I shouldn't bother then.

480
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,958
Khundi, what if anything
untoward happens in the bank?

481
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,000
It can be used as a stick then.

482
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,500
And if anything untoward happens
I anyway cannot handle it by myself.

483
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,541
I can guard the front, but
what will we do about the backdoor?

484
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,708
They just have 5-foot tall walls.
Anyone can jump across those.

485
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,041
There must be someone
guarding the backdoor as well.

486
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,125
Oh great.

487
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,583
They don't have enough staff
to handle the banking duties.

488
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,041
Who will they keep at the backdoor?

489
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,000
These bankers are not
worried just because..

490
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,458
..they share a wall
with the police station.

491
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,291
That's enough to scare anyone.

492
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,958
If someone comes from the backdoor, no
one at the police station will know.

493
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,541
Stop lying, Khundi.

494
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,166
You can scream and
call the policemen.

495
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,291
They will come in no time.

496
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,416
Why are you making
me disclose all secrets?

497
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,041
This bank is running
on God's support.

498
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,125
This is inviting
a robbery then, Khundi.

499
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,958
If nothing they should
raise the walls to 10-foot.

500
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,125
You guys are great.

501
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,000
There is just 250,000 in the bank.

502
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,583
You want them to spend
it on making the walls?

503
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,166
You guys don't have any sense.

504
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,666
That's why none of
your businesses work.

505
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,000
- I'll hit you with this glass.
- Let it be.

506
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,791
We were saying this
for your own good.

507
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,750
We couldn't care much
if you made break the walls..

508
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,500
..sell the rubble and
keep the money in the bank.

509
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,958
- Meshi, put it on my tab.
- Okay.

510
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,208
I'll tell the manager that
two super-smart people paid a visit.

511
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:13,666
They cannot pay Meshi
and they want a loan from bank.

512
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,916
- Right, Meshi.
- Yes.

513
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,916
I don't know how do
I purchase that shop, Lali.

514
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,750
The more I try to move
forward the further I go.

515
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,166
This means you won't
even be able to use the stall?

516
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,041
Seems so.

517
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,333
That's why I said,
how do I face your father?

518
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:34,000
I thought I would try talking to him
about us when he is in good mood.

519
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,500
He won't let him daughter
marry an unemployed man.

520
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,500
Perhaps God wants
me to marry someone else.

521
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,291
Lali, please don't
marry the bank manager.

522
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,875
He won't keep you happy.

523
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,416
I had gone to him to seek loan.

524
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,000
He thinks he is
someone very important.

525
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,000
He will behave like
that at home as well.

526
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,916
I cannot say no because he is bad.

527
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:59,125
I should have a reason to tell my
father that you are better than him.

528
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,625
If you were so concerned about me..

529
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,541
..you should have
done something by now.

530
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:07,416
I want to,
but my fate doesn't support me.

531
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,666
The least I can expect
is your support.

532
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:21,416
We are live from
Kumkala police station.

533
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:25,666
Punjab police has finally
been successful in arresting..

534
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,500
..Sukhchan who scammed
government of 500 million.

535
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:37,916
We are in Kumkala,
district Ludhiana.

536
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,250
Police has been successful
is capturing a very clever criminal.

537
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,250
Yes, we are talking
about Sukhchan Singh.

538
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,500
He has done a scam of 500 million.

539
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,708
We have not been able to talk
to the SHO of this police station..

540
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,833
..and find out how did he manage
to arrest such a clever criminal.

541
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,291
So, Sukhchan got arrested,
how do you feel?

542
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,041
I am feeling very good, brother.

543
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:19,291
But the amount of money that he has,
police will treat him like a guest.

544
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,791
- That's a huge crowd.
- Khundi?

545
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:22,916
Why are so many
people gathered here?

546
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,708
Is there a show
at the police station?

547
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,791
They arrested Sukhchan.

548
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,666
- What!
- Let us do our work.

549
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:35,208
Look, bad deeds meet bad ends.

550
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,375
What will he do with
the 500 million now?

551
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,833
Police will beat
him black and blue..

552
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,875
..and make him even
forget how to count till 50.

553
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,583
Right? Bye.

554
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:47,500
Shinde, good, we did
not think of earning so much..

555
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,833
..otherwise our condition
would have been the same.

556
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,333
I'd suggest we shouldn't
sit with Khundi anymore.

557
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,041
If we don't hear about
it we won't think about it.

558
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,666
- Right.
- Let's go and open our stall.

559
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:02,791
Get lost!

560
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,083
This is yours?

561
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,208
Hello.

562
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,250
I was waiting for you.

563
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,625
Seth, you have given
us 15 days to pay.

564
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,000
It's not even been 3 days.

565
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,666
Look, I thought of something.

566
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,083
How will you manage to arrange
250,000 at such a short notice?

567
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,375
Tell me.

568
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,333
Why don't you say something?

569
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:26,250
What do we say? We are trying.

570
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,958
Look son, don't lie to me.

571
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:33,208
Villagers told me that
I shouldn't waste 15 days on you.

572
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,541
You won't be able to get the money.

573
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,958
I am thinking about
your wellbeing here.

574
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,583
There is one option
if you are interested.

575
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:45,833
If you two sell your houses,
you can gather Rs. 250,000 easily.

576
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,125
What are you saying, Seth?

577
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,208
Where will we stay?

578
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,666
Son, a Baniya is saying that to you.

579
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:51,958
Remember this.

580
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,541
If you have a shop you
can use it to make a house.

581
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,750
But if you have a house,
you cannot use it to make a shop.

582
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,833
You can work hard
and buy a home later.

583
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,375
Until then stay on rent.

584
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,166
He is right.

585
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,375
How is he right? You have a child.

586
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,208
If the business fails
you won't even have a house.

587
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,875
It's not like we are doing good.

588
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,916
We are anyway doomed.

589
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,291
Let's take a chance.

590
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,250
Let it be.

591
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,750
Seth, we said 15 days, so
you will get the money in 15 days.

592
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:19,125
Okay? On the 16th if we haven't paid
you then you can do whatever you want.

593
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,666
- Clear?
- Clear.

594
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,791
Come on.

595
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,041
Meshi, make tea.

596
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,750
Two cups.

597
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,291
Don't worry.

598
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,333
It's okay if we lose the shop.
We will open a tea stall.

599
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,625
Right, ruin my business.

600
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,166
We will set it up somewhere else.

601
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,500
We won't take your business.

602
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,458
Shinde, look there.

603
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:56,250
Shinda?

604
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,541
Shinda?

605
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,916
Who is Shinda, dear?

606
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,750
- Daddy, didn't I tell you about him?
- Okay.

607
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:11,625
Shinda, my daddy.

608
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,083
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

609
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,375
What are you doing here?

610
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,666
I had come to deposit
money in the bank.

611
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:21,125
It is not right to keep
a lot of cash at home, uncle.

612
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,750
You are right, son.

613
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:24,791
- Times are bad.
- Yes.

614
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:27,416
You save money with
great difficulty.

615
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,375
You should keep your
savings in the bank.

616
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,375
We are going to the bank now.

617
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:33,958
I know the manager.

618
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,791
Let me introduce you as well.

619
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,625
Let's go. Come on.

620
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,208
Let's go.
He will help us get better returns.

621
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:44,041
You are back to take a loan?

622
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,791
Come with me.

623
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,291
Do your work, come on.

624
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,166
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

625
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,250
- Hello, Lali.
- Hello.

626
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,291
You are back?

627
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,291
Sukhdev, we know them.

628
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:00,166
They have come to deposit
money in your bank.

629
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,583
But uncle, they don't
have an account in this bank.

630
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,333
- They don't have any account?
- Yes.

631
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,541
We want to open a new
account and deposit the money.

632
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:09,500
No problem.
We'll open a new account.

633
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,208
We are here to open new accounts.

634
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,125
Let's go. Come, Lali.

635
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,541
Come with me.

636
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,083
Brother, new accounts
are opened over here.

637
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,083
Please have a seat.

638
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:20,333
- Pushpa?
- Yes, sir?

639
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,416
Open a new account for
them and deposit their money.

640
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,625
- Please have a seat.
- Okay, sir.

641
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,500
Lali, uncle, please come with me.

642
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,333
Have a seat, I'll get the form.

643
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,666
Uncle, you always said
that you will come here.

644
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:34,708
So you have finally come here today.

645
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,416
Yes, I am finally here.

646
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:37,375
Have a seat.

647
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,625
What would you like
tea or a cold drink?

648
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:43,875
No, thank you.

649
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:45,625
Not done. Lali, what about you?

650
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,541
- No, thank you.
- What will we deposit?

651
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,416
We don't have any money.
Let's deposit your kidneys instead.

652
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,166
You are the one who go us here.

653
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,833
We usually used to get
insulted outside the bank.

654
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,041
Today we will get
insulted inside the bank.

655
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,791
Think about how we
will get out of here.

656
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,083
Let's go home.
Why are you torturing yourself?

657
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,000
Let's go, Balli.

658
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,166
Here's the form. Fill it.

659
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,666
Also give me a copy
of your PAN and Aadhar Card.

660
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,375
I only have an Aadhar Card.

661
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:23,250
Then let it be.
We'll come some other time.

662
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,375
- Let's go.
- Keep coming here, uncle.

663
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,875
Pushpa, did you open the account?

664
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,958
Sir, they don't have a PAN Card.

665
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,666
It's okay.
He'll give it some other time.

666
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,708
He is well known to uncle.

667
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:35,791
Open the account.

668
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,833
How much money will you deposit?

669
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,041
Tell her.

670
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
How much money can one
deposit at the most in your bank?

671
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:44,000
Brother, a bank has the capacity
of the sea when it comes to money.

672
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,333
You can deposit as much as you want.

673
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,250
Think before you reply. I don't
even have a penny in my pocket.

674
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,791
I want to deposit 100,000 rupees.

675
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,625
Uncle, I am about to buy a shop.

676
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,041
I had the money at home for that.

677
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,500
I thought why keep it at home.

678
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,875
The deal hasn't gone through as yet.
So I should deposit it in the bank.

679
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,166
You are going to buy a shop?

680
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,166
Look daddy, Shinda is
trying his best to progress.

681
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,125
But why isn't the
deal going through, son?

682
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:11,125
Well, Seth won't budge
from 250,000 rupees.

683
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:14,708
I thought he should reduce a
little as it is not worth that much.

684
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,291
Then why don't you
ask daddy to mediate?

685
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,000
He has been a government
school teacher.

686
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,500
Everyone in and around
the village respects him.

687
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,291
Seth will surely
be considerate with him.

688
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,166
No, it is not right to trouble
uncle over such a small thing.

689
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:30,250
Son, what is the harm
if my mediation helps you?

690
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,750
Let's go meet Seth.

691
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,958
We will give him 100,000 and ask
him how much can he go down for me.

692
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:37,333
- Right?
- Let's go! Let's go!

693
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,083
- Bye.
- Bye.

694
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,583
Bye, Lali.

695
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,875
Is he trying to influence my Lali?

696
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:47,666
Here you go.

697
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,041
Hello, Mohanlal.

698
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:56,375
- Hello. Sir, you?
- Hello.

699
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,833
How can I help you?

700
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,041
These kids told me that
they wish to buy your shop.

701
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,541
Yes, they do.

702
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,916
I know them quite well.

703
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,333
Then I don't know to worry.

704
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,000
I'll give them as
much as time they want.

705
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,125
- We don't want time.
- Okay.

706
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,666
-You will get the money on time.
- Okay.

707
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:17,500
- You asked for 250,000, right?
- Yes.

708
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,916
Now tell me,
how much can you go down for me.

709
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,125
We'll give you 100,000 right away.

710
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:26,041
Look, I won't lie to you.

711
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,458
A merchant in the city
has quoted 250,000 for it.

712
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,583
Now I will do as you say.

713
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,791
Tell me boys,
how much will you pay him?

714
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,041
Uncle, thank you for speaking
to him, now we will handle the rest.

715
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:40,250
Look, they had accepted
to pay 250,000.

716
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:43,458
I can give 10,000
rupees discount for you.

717
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,291
Shinda, give 100,000 to Seth.

718
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,208
- They will give it to me?
- Yes.

719
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,250
I thought you will give it.

720
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,250
Actually,
these boys had cash in hand.

721
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,125
They were about to deposit it in the
bank as deal didn't went through.

722
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,666
I told them that
I would accompany them.

723
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,250
- You won't say no to me.
- Okay.

724
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:08,750
Thank you very much for
giving me so much respect.

725
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,333
Bye, Shinda.

726
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,458
Come home in the evening. Okay?

727
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,750
- Bye.
- Sir?

728
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,333
- Yes.
- The 100,000 rupees advance?

729
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,166
At least give me that.

730
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,375
Uncle, I think in a hurry
I forgot the money at home.

731
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,875
I'll give it to you in the evening.
You are just like family.

732
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,500
Bye, Sethji. We will be leaving now.

733
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,750
Son, do come home in the evening.

734
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,875
- We will have sweets ready for you.
- Okay.

735
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,750
Let's go, dear. Let's go.

736
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,500
Shinda, here's 20,000 rupees.

737
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:43,791
I'll give you 180,000 as
soon as you give me the documents.

738
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,541
Lalaji, I am selling my house.

739
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,125
If you could give
me some more money?

740
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,958
Shinda, this isn't a house.
This is just a piece of land.

741
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,125
No one will give you
the money I am giving you.

742
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,250
Heed my advice, take this
money and start your own business.

743
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,958
Listen, you got hyper when
I asked you to sell my house.

744
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,458
You didn't take much time
to sell your house. How is it fair?

745
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,208
Try to understand, Balli.

746
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,375
You should have seen
how happy Lali's father was..

747
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:09,583
..when he knew we bought a shop.

748
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:14,375
If this works out then I am sure he
will certainly think and me and Lali.

749
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,541
That's why he has
invited me for tea.

750
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,166
I can do anything for Lali.

751
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:23,791
We will go and tell Seth that
we have arranged for 200,000 rupees.

752
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,041
I have sold my house.

753
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,083
We will somehow arrange
for the rest 50,000 as well.

754
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,583
- Right?
- Okay.

755
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,708
I am very happy today.

756
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,583
I too am very happy for you,
brother.

757
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,500
- Wait.
- What happened?

758
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,250
- Janu.
- It must be Lali.

759
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,333
She must be asking what time
will I come home in the evening.

760
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,166
Hello?

761
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,083
Balli! Simran!

762
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,958
Come soon!

763
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,208
- What happened, Gurmeet?
- She fell.

764
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,083
Balli, our Simran!

765
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,875
Don't worry, Gurmeet.

766
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,916
- Where is she?
- Inside.

767
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,791
My daughter!

768
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:24,750
The tumour in her
stomach has expanded.

769
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,666
Doctor said just medicines
won't be enough now.

770
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,750
We will have to get her operated.

771
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,791
We need 200,000 rupees.

772
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,541
We don't have that kind of money,
Gurmeet.

773
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,250
Sister-in-law, ask doctor
to prepare for the operation.

774
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,375
- We'll arrange for the money.
- Yes.

775
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,791
Come, Balli.

776
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,500
What had we thought
and what happened, Shinda!

777
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,625
Why do you worry?

778
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,583
They will operate on
Simran within a week's time.

779
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,000
Everything will be fine.

780
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,125
But the shop?

781
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,166
You sold your house for it.

782
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:19,333
Stupid, to marry the girl you love and
to set up your business comes later.

783
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,041
The most important thing
is the life of a loved one.

784
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:25,125
I am happy that my house
got sold for a good deed.

785
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,583
- Hello?
- Hello, Shinda?

786
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,125
Lali.

787
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,333
- Lali?
- Shinda, why didn't you come?

788
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,666
Daddy is waiting for you.

789
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:46,166
We had to get Balli's daughter
admitted in a hospital.

790
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,041
Oh God. What happened?

791
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:50,541
- Is everything alright?
- Yes, she was unwell.

792
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,583
Apologise to uncle on my behalf.

793
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,666
- I'll come as soon as I am free.
- It's okay. You stay there.

794
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:58,583
By the way,
did you give the money to Sethji?

795
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,041
- Yes, I gave him 100,000.
- Okay.

796
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,625
Fine, I'll wait for you. Bye.

797
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,083
I don't want any excuses.

798
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,750
I was shocked yesterday
when the teacher said..

799
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,416
..you have 100,000 cash on you.

800
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,833
It is true,
I sold my house to buy the shop.

801
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,041
Then where is the money?

802
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,041
I told you we had got 20,000.
His daughter was unwell.

803
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,208
So we had to give
it to the hospital.

804
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,250
Stop bluffing, guys.

805
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,958
Go and check in the hospital
if you don't believe us.

806
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,166
She is still there.

807
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:32,291
We might be scoundrels,
but we won't lie about our daughter.

808
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,916
But I am in fix now.

809
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:37,375
Either let me sell the
shop because you cannot buy it.

810
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,875
You had given us 15 days.

811
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,208
You can do anything
you want after that.

812
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,291
There aren't many days left anyway.

813
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,291
I need to deposit
some money in the bank.

814
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:46,541
I'll be right back.

815
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,041
He goes to the bank to
deposit his change every day.

816
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,708
Have you ever had
an account in the bank?

817
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,708
If you had then you would know,
I have an overdraft.

818
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,333
I need to deposit
15,000-20,000 every week.

819
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,916
Go before the bank closes.

820
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:00,875
Keep them back.

821
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,500
Go, go, go!

822
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,041
Don't push, Inspector.

823
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,625
You'll get into trouble.

824
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,833
I am yet to push you.

825
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,416
If I do, you won't remain standing.

826
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,750
Let's go.

827
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,458
Get him in. Hey! Stay back!

828
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:22,625
Get him in. Go.

829
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,958
Come on. Stay back!

830
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:40,958
Yes, sir?

831
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,125
Brother, is the bank
closed because of Sukhchan?

832
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,208
No Mr. Mohanlal,
bank officers are on strike today.

833
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,875
They have nothing else to do.
They keep going on strikes.

834
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

835
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,375
Hello.

836
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,875
He is a liar.

837
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:59,083
I trusted him because of you.

838
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,291
Seth too lashed out at me.

839
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:06,458
I have made this decision
after due consideration.

840
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,500
This boy isn't right for you.

841
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,666
Who lies to their loved ones,
Shinda?

842
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,375
I even sold my house
for the shop, Lali.

843
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,375
Balli's daughter fell ill.

844
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,041
There is nothing I could do.

845
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,083
I am out of luck here.

846
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:29,125
No matter what I tell daddy now,
he will think that I am lying.

847
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:32,916
I tried so hard to form a
good image of you in front of daddy.

848
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,500
After he met the manager, he
doesn't even want to hear about you.

849
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,791
But you understand, don't you?
That I did the right thing?

850
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,791
Why don't you hold my hand?

851
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,583
Why are you staring at me?

852
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,541
I am just asking for her hand.

853
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:53,125
Shinda..

854
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,833
Shinda!

855
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,916
Never mess with a Jatt's girlfriend.

856
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:44,833
If you ever do,
never do it in front of the Jatt.

857
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,916
If you ever want to
do it in front of the Jatt..

858
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,625
..then check his mood first.

859
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,583
Because Jatt likes
to break some bones..

860
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,500
..when he is in a bad mood.

861
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,416
Brother, we are not with them.

862
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,083
We just took a lift from them.
We will go with someone else.

863
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,833
Let's go. Come on.

864
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,958
I can die for you.

865
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,541
And I can kill for you.

866
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,666
So, a shop isn't a big deal.

867
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,958
"Your beauty has become
the talk of the town."

868
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,250
"The money you spend
makes me frown."

869
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:56,708
"Your beauty has become
the talk of the town."

870
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:59,333
"The money you spend
makes me frown."

871
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,833
"You end up killing me.."

872
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,333
"..when you get on
the roof to see me."

873
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:07,333
"Your gait is a killer too."

874
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,541
"You keep embroidering
your dresses.."

875
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,291
"Why don't you
embellish my dress too?"

876
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:17,958
"You keep embroidering
your dresses.."

877
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:20,625
"Why don't you
embellish my dress too?"

878
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:44,666
"You are beautiful like the Heer.."

879
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,583
"I am crazy about thee."

880
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,000
"I am crazy about thee."

881
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,583
"I am crazy about thee."

882
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:55,333
"You are beautiful like the Heer.."

883
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,000
"I am crazy about thee."

884
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,625
"Make me your beloved."

885
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,958
"Your brothers too
will accept me as a buddy."

886
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,125
"Form a relationship with me."

887
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:11,291
"You keep embroidering
your dresses.."

888
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:13,958
"Why don't you
embellish my dress too?"

889
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:16,666
"You keep embroidering
your dresses.."

890
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,291
"Why don't you
embellish my dress too?"

891
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,833
'Court has sent Sukhchan
on a seven day remand.'

892
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,250
'Police was ordered to
investigate his accompanists too.'

893
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:37,208
'They should find out where Sukhchan
is hiding the 500 million rupees.'

894
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:41,875
You love to run away, don't you?

895
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,291
I'll soon make you
run for your life.

896
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,458
I'll fulfill all your desires.

897
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,250
You fulfill all your desires soon,
Inspector.

898
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,541
You won't be able to find me again.

899
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:59,125
You will get out..

900
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:03,041
..only after you finish the
punishment government gives you.

901
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,791
If that doesn't happen
then I am not my father's son.

902
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:08,875
No.

903
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,750
Don't make such claims,
Kuldeep Singh.

904
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,333
50 million is a huge sum.

905
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,625
You won't be able to
earn it in your lifetime.

906
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,125
Take it and get me out of here.

907
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:23,750
You can blame it
on someone's stupidity.

908
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,125
You are right.

909
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:32,083
I can take the money.

910
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,125
But I still haven't stooped so low..

911
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,791
..that I'll take it from you.

912
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,250
- Baint?
- Yes?

913
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:43,500
Come here.

914
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,666
He will be sentenced
in within a week's time.

915
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:49,791
He will soon leave.

916
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:53,250
Take such good care of him..

917
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,708
..that no one should
know whether he sighs..

918
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,041
..because of our
hospitality or piles.

919
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:57,916
Okay, sir.

920
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:01,041
Don't take the money if
you don't want to, Inspector.

921
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:05,458
Those who want me out..

922
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:08,541
..must have already made the layout
of your police station by now.

923
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,375
- Give him some tea
and stuffed flatbread. - Yes, sir.

924
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:16,916
With pickles?

925
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:21,666
Balli, what do you think,
what will be his sentence?

926
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,916
He stole government's money.
He will be given a harsh punishment.

927
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:28,458
It is government's fault.
They don't make proper arrangements.

928
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,333
They are bound to steal.

929
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,125
Look at our bank for example.

930
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:34,000
Anyone can rob it anytime.

931
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,916
Stop your nonsense.

932
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:38,625
We don't come here
to talk about robbery.

933
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:42,125
Brother, who else do I share
my feelings with if not you?

934
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,208
- You don't talk, you bluff.
- Yes.

935
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,166
We have been inside the bank.

936
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,416
You told us about
the 5-feet tall walls.

937
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:53,666
But you didn't mention
the door beyond that.

938
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,750
It is a wooden door,
its wood is weak.

939
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,708
A dog managed to get
through it yesterday.

940
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,416
We got it reinforced by a carpenter.

941
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,625
I am sure the carpenter
must have done a good job.

942
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,166
How can anyone break
open that door now?

943
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,333
I told you that the wood is weak.

944
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,375
You can literally scrape
your way in through the door.

945
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:19,541
There are just three
employees inside.

946
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:23,041
You can make them stand
in a corner by showing them a gun.

947
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:25,041
You can steal all the money.

948
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:28,291
No one outside will have
a clue about what's going on inside.

949
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:33,875
Hello!

950
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,875
Moreover,
this gun doesn't work either.

951
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,375
- But you can hit them with this gun.
- Yes.

952
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:42,375
I am a peon, I offer people tea,
I don't hit them.

953
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,041
Don't make me disclose all secrets.

954
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,416
Let some things remain a secret.

955
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,083
It's no longer a secret, you stupid.

956
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:48,291
You have told us everything.

957
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:51,000
Don't worry,
Khundi, no one will rob your bank.

958
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,500
I know your gun doesn't work.

959
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,625
But you can shout and
call the policemen, right?

960
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,583
Here's another secret.

961
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,916
- Come closer.
- Do you want us to sit on your lap?

962
00:47:59,041 --> 00:47:59,916
Listen to me.

963
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,291
When there is lunch
break in the bank..

964
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,125
All the staff members makes
me serve them tea and lunch.

965
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,750
By the time I get to eat,
the lunch break is over.

966
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:16,125
I come out to have lunch
after the lunch break.

967
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,583
Anyone can rob the
bank during this time.

968
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:24,875
Balli!'

969
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,708
'Take the money!
We have faced enough of poverty.'

970
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:28,125
'Come on.

971
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,875
Damn you, Manager!

972
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,083
Come. I'll kill you.

973
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:42,875
I am just a peon,
no one will pay heed to me.

974
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:46,666
They will say this when
something untoward happens.

975
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,166
"Yes, Khundi was right."

976
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:59,958
'Consider the bank
robbed then, Khundi.'

977
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:04,375
"The young man is going
around in full form."

978
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,791
"The young man will
become James Bond today."

979
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:14,583
"The young man is going
around in full form."

980
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:17,291
"The young man will
become James Bond today."

981
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:19,916
"He is being talked
about everywhere."

982
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:24,083
"He roams around in one area."

983
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,583
"With great courage and no fear"

984
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:34,041
"Today the robbers
are going to loot."

985
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:37,083
"With great courage and no fear"

986
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:40,250
"Today the robbers
are going to loot."

987
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,791
"With great courage and no fear"

988
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:45,708
"Today the robbers
are going to loot."

989
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:48,541
The well,
the village square, the dispensary..

990
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,625
..the police station and the bank.

991
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,083
Wow, you arranged for this so soon?

992
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,000
I have been in this village
since 38 years.

993
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,625
I know all these places
as the back of my hand.

994
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:03,750
According to Khundi this
door won't last more than two kicks.

995
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:07,708
Because it is at the back no one
will get a sound when it's broken.

996
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,541
That is fine, Shinda.

997
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:12,083
Just give it another thought.

998
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:14,333
Do we really need to
rob a bank to get the money?

999
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,583
We aren't doing it for money.

1000
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:22,791
We are doing it for Lali's love.

1001
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,541
Why don't you just say that you
want to embarrass the bank manager.

1002
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:30,833
You can take it as you like.

1003
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,458
Then consider it robbed, Shinda.

1004
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:37,250
Shinda along with
friends does this work.

1005
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:40,083
25 villages are with you.

1006
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:42,916
25 villages are scared of you.

1007
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,791
Shinda has power
of explosives in him.

1008
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,083
I'll show you how
to break the bank's door.

1009
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,416
We will both run towards
it at full speed.

1010
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,000
And kick on the door.

1011
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,541
Have knives in your pocket even
if you are attacked with sword.

1012
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,125
It's quite windy out here.

1013
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:08,666
I'll hold the door, you kick it.

1014
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,250
Have knives in your pocket even
if you are attacked with sword.

1015
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:16,625
I'll lift my hand as you approach.

1016
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,208
Give me a signal when you come.

1017
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,583
The eyes of heart is watching you.

1018
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,791
Where is he?
Why hasn't he come as yet?

1019
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:35,000
With courage he is going to loot.

1020
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,625
I am so dead, Shinda!

1021
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,083
With courage he is going to loot.

1022
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:41,583
Stand up.

1023
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,125
I'll come back.

1024
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:46,750
Fine.

1025
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:50,666
Balli, that's the village
police station and that's the bank.

1026
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:52,833
And these are the tiny
lanes of the village.

1027
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:54,958
If we get separated while running..

1028
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:57,375
..we will go and hide at the shed.

1029
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,250
Now the most important thing.

1030
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:02,833
You will go dressed as
a female for this robbery.

1031
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,625
Are we going to rob
a bank or for a dance?

1032
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,791
Try to understand.

1033
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,833
- Police will think that a man
and a woman robbed the bank. - Okay.

1034
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,041
They will be their suspects.

1035
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,666
No one will look for us.

1036
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:15,666
Take a worn-out dress from your
wife and prepare for the robbery.

1037
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,166
- See you later.
- Okay.

1038
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:22,666
The young man is going
around in full form.

1039
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:28,541
Why are you home so early?

1040
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,750
- I needed something.
- What do you want?

1041
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,458
Do you have any old
dress and ornaments?

1042
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,750
Why?

1043
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:37,375
A priest told me that if we
give your old dress and ornaments..

1044
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,875
..to a poor person then
it will be good for our business.

1045
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:44,375
Strange, there are
people even poorer than us?

1046
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:45,916
Wait, I'll give it to you.

1047
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:52,083
What's my baby doing?

1048
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,416
I am studying.

1049
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,750
Here, take it.

1050
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,958
Hold it.

1051
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:02,166
Let me put it.

1052
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,041
You are dropping half the things.
You will only get half the benefits.

1053
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:07,125
Oh God, please help us.

1054
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,125
Sir, your lunch.

1055
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:01,916
Okay.

1056
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:04,958
Listen, get me some pickle as well.

1057
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,750
Madam, your tea.
I'm going for lunch.

1058
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,166
Okay.

1059
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,500
- Meshi, make me some tea.
- I'm making it. Have a seat.

1060
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:34,416
I am leaving.

1061
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:46,375
I'll shoot the person who moves.

1062
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,833
Parvati, close the door.

1063
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,166
Parvati, close the door.

1064
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:53,375
Stupid, you are Parvati.

1065
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:55,291
- Sorry, sweetheart.
- Dacoits?

1066
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,833
Do we look like angels to you?

1067
00:55:57,958 --> 00:55:59,541
Where's the cash?

1068
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:01,208
- With Pushpa.
- Who is Pushpa?

1069
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,416
Who is Pushpa?

1070
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:05,083
I asked who is Pushpa!

1071
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:07,166
- Raise your hand.
- Sir, I.

1072
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,125
Don't come here, Pushpa.
Just give me the cash.

1073
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,666
This is not right.

1074
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:12,875
- I'll shoot you.
- Oh, God!

1075
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,833
Parvati, take the cash from Pushpa.

1076
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,375
- Come on. Come on.
- Let's go.

1077
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:17,416
- Come on!
- Hey!

1078
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,708
No, brother.

1079
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:21,125
- Remove the money.
- Oh, God.

1080
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:22,791
- Give me the money.
- Here you go.

1081
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:24,708
- How much is it?
- Rs. 80,000.

1082
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:25,750
80,000?

1083
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,708
Do you think we have nothing else
to do? You want us to come back?

1084
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,000
It's under you.

1085
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,583
Oh! Oh, my God, take it out.

1086
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,958
- Rs. 50,000.
- 50! 80 and 50, 130.

1087
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:39,625
30!

1088
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:41,208
- 160.
- Brother..

1089
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,083
And 20.

1090
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:43,333
That's just 180.

1091
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,208
- I'll lose my job, brother.
- I want Rs. 2,50,000.

1092
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:46,916
That's all we have.

1093
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:49,083
Ujagar, they only have 180.

1094
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:50,416
Kill Pushpa.

1095
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,791
She will make sure
you will get Rs. 250,000.

1096
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:54,958
No, Parvati. That's all we have.

1097
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,166
How will give you Rs. 250,000?

1098
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,541
You..

1099
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,708
You better don't interfere.

1100
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,708
I'll get you married.

1101
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:05,791
Ujagar, brother, what does this
robbery have to do with my marriage?

1102
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:08,208
Ujagar, sweetheart,
we have nothing to do with this.

1103
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:09,916
Don't get us into trouble
by talking about marriage.

1104
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,708
Sir? Why have you closed
the door from inside?

1105
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:21,416
- It's not closing time yet.
- Hey!

1106
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:25,250
We have information that there
are Rs. 250,000 rupees in the bank.

1107
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:28,250
Give us the right amount
or else I will shoot you.

1108
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:31,125
- We gave you what we had.
- Yes.

1109
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:32,833
We really don't have it. I swear.

1110
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:35,541
If you don't believe
it then you can search us.

1111
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:38,083
- Madam!
- How can I search you? It's not right.

1112
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:41,125
- Hello! Not one is listening.
- Sister can.

1113
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,291
Okay, no problem.

1114
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:44,916
Parvati, concentrate
on what we came here to do.

1115
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,125
We don't have time to waste.

1116
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:50,083
180 isn't enough for us.
Give us 250 or else..

1117
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,250
- Damn you.
- Yes.

1118
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:52,375
Manager sir!

1119
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:54,333
Open the door, I am waiting.

1120
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:56,208
I don't understand..

1121
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:58,541
..which idiot told you that there is
Rs. 250,000 rupees in the bank.

1122
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:00,208
- Some bloody smart..
- Madam?

1123
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:01,916
- What?
"- Open the door!"

1124
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:03,541
He has been
shouting from quite some time now.

1125
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,041
Police can show up anytime now.

1126
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:06,833
Stay back! Stay back!

1127
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,375
Stay back!

1128
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:09,916
Open the door, I am waiting!

1129
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,916
- What are you doing?
- Open the door!

1130
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:13,791
You!

1131
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,125
What are you doing?

1132
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:17,833
Manager sir!

1133
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,875
- Manager can't do anything.
- Ujagar, that gun doesn't work.

1134
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Use our gun.

1135
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,291
Put your hands down.

1136
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,541
Come closer.

1137
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:31,750
You scoundrel, you lie to people that
there is 250,000 rupees in the bank.

1138
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:32,958
They don't even have Rs. 2,00,000.

1139
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:35,083
I swear, I never said that.

1140
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:37,083
You keep telling everyone.

1141
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:39,541
I want 250!

1142
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,833
I'll kill everyone!

1143
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,750
No, brother! We gave you all we had.

1144
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,125
We don't have anymore.
I am telling the truth. I swear.

1145
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,083
Ujagar, please listen to me.

1146
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,416
I won't listen to anyone.

1147
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,583
You will have to.

1148
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:53,666
Can't we make do with 180?

1149
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,916
We cannot. We need 240.

1150
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,541
We are still short of 60.

1151
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:58,791
We need 240.

1152
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:03,583
Ujagar, why don't
you come back later?

1153
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:04,875
- Do you think we are fools?
- Yes.

1154
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,958
You want us to get arrested
by coming back here?

1155
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:08,125
No. Let go of my hand.

1156
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:09,875
We can do one thing.

1157
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,625
It's 03:25pm right now.
People deposit money till 4 o'clock.

1158
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,708
We will open the gate
and let the depositors in.

1159
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,416
You will get the rest of the money.
Don't worry.

1160
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:17,750
Yes.

1161
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:19,791
Security guard!

1162
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:22,541
Open the gate and
spend people inside.

1163
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:24,333
If someone comes
to withdraw the money..

1164
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:26,291
- ..then you will also lose the 180.
- Yes.

1165
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:29,333
Send only the depositors.

1166
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:32,000
If someone comes to withdraw then
say that the bank is out of cash.

1167
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,083
Do you understand?

1168
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:34,875
If you try to act smart..

1169
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,333
..then we know that your gun
doesn't work but ours surely does.

1170
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:39,500
We will shoot you.

1171
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:41,625
- My shoulder hurts.
- I know.

1172
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:44,041
- How do you know?
- We rob banks.

1173
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,250
We don't have tea
in the canteen, stupid.

1174
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:51,083
- Parvati!
- Yes, Ujagar?

1175
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,416
Get his gun.

1176
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,250
Give it to him.

1177
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,500
Hold my gun.

1178
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,875
Take the manager inside.

1179
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,250
If anyone tries to act smart..

1180
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:03,208
..then he or she won't be able to
watch the whole robbery take place.

1181
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,375
- You.. sit down.
- No..

1182
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,125
Not there. On your chair.

1183
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,750
- You aren't at a funeral.
- Come on.

1184
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:09,958
Sit down.

1185
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:14,750
Stand up.

1186
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,583
How are you, Khundi?

1187
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:19,250
- How's your shoulder?
- Forget about the shoulder.

1188
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,125
Just tell me are you
here to deposit or withdraw?

1189
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,125
Withdraw.

1190
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:23,750
There is no cash in the bank.
Come back tomorrow.

1191
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:25,666
Oh I see.
So, I'll have to come back tomorrow?

1192
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,041
No, the manager will
come to your home.

1193
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:28,250
Fine, I'll come on Tuesday.

1194
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:35,291
Madam, I wanted to
deposit 5000 rupees.

1195
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,000
Okay.

1196
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:40,791
Here you go.

1197
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,458
How are you, Khundi?

1198
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:46,583
I am fine. Why have you come here?

1199
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:48,500
- My child studies in the city.
- Okay.

1200
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:50,458
I need to pay his fees.
I came to withdraw Rs. 35,000.

1201
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:52,041
There is no cash in the bank.
Come back tomorrow.

1202
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:53,458
I didn't ask for 10 million.

1203
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,708
This is such a useless bank.

1204
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,666
They don't even have Rs. 35,000.
Move aside.

1205
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:59,208
We don't have cash, brother.
Come back tomorrow.

1206
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:00,833
At least let me talk to them.

1207
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:03,083
Tomorrow is the last
day to pay the fees.

1208
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:03,958
Come on.

1209
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:05,958
- Sister-in-law, talk to him.
- Let us go inside and talk to them.

1210
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,583
Come inside.

1211
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:15,583
Madam, we wanted to
withdraw 35,000 rupees.

1212
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:18,000
How did you come inside?

1213
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,750
This is a limit.

1214
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,250
No one questioned when
we wanted to deposit the money.

1215
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,791
Today when we are here
to withdraw our own money..

1216
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:25,166
..you are asking
how did we come inside?

1217
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:29,291
Actually, the bank is out of cash.

1218
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:30,541
Please come back tomorrow.

1219
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:33,333
I want it today.
I need to send it to my child.

1220
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:36,791
Give it to me from the
deposits you collect today.

1221
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:40,000
- Sir, please come back tomorrow.
- I want the money today.

1222
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:43,583
Bloody Khundi is sending
people in to withdraw.

1223
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,583
- Yes, uncle?
- I have come to deposit some money.

1224
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:47,166
- Go inside.
- Let's go and sit there.

1225
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,416
We will only leave
after we get the money.

1226
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:51,000
They will not give this way.
We have not come to take loan.

1227
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,000
Ma'am?

1228
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:55,833
I want to deposit Rs. 25,000
in the agent's account.

1229
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,291
200, 205, 210.

1230
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,625
We have 210 now.

1231
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,458
We are still short of 30.

1232
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:20,583
Call all those who have
an account in this bank..

1233
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,833
..and ask them to
deposit some money.

1234
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:24,000
Brother, no one will come
like this to deposit.

1235
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,125
People should have
money to deposit it.

1236
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,125
You..

1237
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:28,791
- Open the book. Open it!
- I am.

1238
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:39,666
Give me the Rs. 25,000
that man just deposited.

1239
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:41,791
- I will manage with that much.
- How can we give it to you?

1240
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:44,625
We need to collect
240 for someone before you.

1241
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:46,625
May your bank get doomed.

1242
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,000
May your bank be robbed.

1243
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:49,208
Let's go.

1244
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,958
It is a cheater bank.

1245
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:53,625
You and your bank..

1246
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,416
I think you get it.

1247
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:56,583
Let's go.

1248
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:57,916
To hell with you all.

1249
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:23,333
- Hello, Sethji?
- Yes, Shinda?

1250
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,833
That day you weren't
able to deposit the money.

1251
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:28,000
Make sure you deposit
the money in the bank today.

1252
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,416
How can I go leaving
the shop unattended?

1253
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:31,708
Where are you two?

1254
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,833
Sethji, we are stuck
doing some important.

1255
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:39,000
We heard that you'd be fined if
you don't deposit the money today.

1256
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,541
You should go there. Okay?

1257
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,291
It's about to be 4 o'clock.

1258
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:44,583
Bank won't take any deposits now.

1259
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:47,166
They will, for you.
At least come here.

1260
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:51,166
What are you saying?
Not come here, go there.

1261
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,000
Right. I mean at least go there.

1262
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,208
Fine, I'll close the shutter and go.

1263
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,458
210 and 15.

1264
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:01,791
225.

1265
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:03,750
We are still short.

1266
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:32,958
Yes? Who do you want to meet?

1267
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:54,000
Ujagar, I think the
guard fired his gun.

1268
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:56,416
Parvati, quickly take the
money we have managed to gather.

1269
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,958
You, sit down.

1270
01:04:58,458 --> 01:04:59,875
Khundi, you traitor.

1271
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,458
He told us that
the gun doesn't work.

1272
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:03,416
He shot 15 bullets from it.

1273
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,625
Sit! Sit down!

1274
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,458
Bomb! Bomb!

1275
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:46,375
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!

1276
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,083
Hold my hand.

1277
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,458
- Pushpa.
- Pushpa.

1278
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,125
Save me.

1279
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,458
Start the jeep!

1280
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:39,791
- Quickly sit down, Parvati.
- Brother, you had come to rob the bank.

1281
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,291
- Why are you taking me with you?
- Where did you come from?

1282
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,458
You brought me here
by holding my hand.

1283
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,875
It's just been two minutes,
please let me go back.

1284
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,125
My life will get ruined
if anyone finds out about this.

1285
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:52,958
Couldn't you speak up sooner?

1286
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,208
I got scared.

1287
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:55,541
But you spoke up now.

1288
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,875
- If Parvati gets caught inside then we
both will be in trouble. - Sweetheart!

1289
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:01,375
- Help me.
- Come on.

1290
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:05,583
- Brother, help me jump across the wall.
- Hurry up.

1291
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:07,666
Brothers never help
sister jump across walls.

1292
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:08,666
Push the bike.

1293
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,791
Sit, Parvati.

1294
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:13,541
Move aside.

1295
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,666
Catch him.

1296
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:00,958
Go from that side.

1297
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,541
Balli!

1298
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:27,791
Shinda!

1299
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:31,791
Where?

1300
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,666
Sit down.

1301
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:38,958
Come on.

1302
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:41,250
This way.

1303
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:45,166
We are safe now.

1304
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:49,083
Sukhchan.

1305
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:50,916
Don't make any noise.

1306
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:52,041
- Yes.
- Okay.

1307
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,125
And I won't tell anyone
that a man came..

1308
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:58,666
..to the warehouse shed.

1309
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,083
Why are you here, brother?

1310
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,458
My men got me out.

1311
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:08,208
Police is searching for me.

1312
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:10,791
The police is looking for you?

1313
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:15,958
You left the money at the bank?

1314
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:19,375
Stupid, you shouldn't
raise your hand at a woman.

1315
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,333
Can you get me out of here?

1316
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:23,625
What are you saying, brother?

1317
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,125
We got out with great difficulty.

1318
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:26,250
We cannot.

1319
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:30,541
Son, 50 million is a big amount.

1320
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:31,833
Think about it.

1321
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:36,000
- 50 million?
- I'll give you 50 million..

1322
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:38,916
..if you get me out of here.

1323
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:44,750
I'll get you out
but reduce the amount.

1324
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,291
Such a huge sum will
cause us a heart attack.

1325
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:49,666
Stupid, you shouldn't
say no to money.

1326
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:51,333
Half the job is already done.

1327
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:53,708
You just need to get
me out of this village.

1328
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:03,833
I'll do something.

1329
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:05,875
You stay here.

1330
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:11,708
- Brother..
- How are you doing?

1331
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:14,833
Shinda!

1332
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:17,916
- What happened!
- Tell him, that I am a man.

1333
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,000
It is your fault.
Remove the veil from your face.

1334
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,791
He didn't give me the time.

1335
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,291
He's a man.

1336
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,583
Uncle!
Uncle, I am taking your cart.

1337
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:46,458
It's okay, son. There's
fodder in it. You can take it.

1338
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:49,125
I'll take it along the fodder
and bring it back as it is.

1339
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:51,750
Do whatever is feasible for you.

1340
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,125
Okay, uncle. Let's go, dear.

1341
01:13:58,625 --> 01:13:59,500
Here.

1342
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:20,125
Don't sit on him. Move that way.

1343
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:22,041
We are hiding someone over there.

1344
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,541
Check properly.

1345
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:38,041
- Sukhchan shouldn't escape.
- Stop the car.

1346
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,000
Police is checking everyone.

1347
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:41,291
I don't think..

1348
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:42,750
..we will be able to
help him leave the village.

1349
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,625
We shouldn't get into trouble..

1350
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:46,208
..because of him.

1351
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:47,333
Let's go back to the village.

1352
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:50,791
Make it believable
that just got the fodder.

1353
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:05,208
They said that a
lot of shots were fired.

1354
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:07,041
Did they catch anyone?

1355
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:09,583
- Police caught all the goons.
- Okay.

1356
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:12,041
- But they couldn't get hold
of Sukhchan. - Oh no.

1357
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:14,750
- Police was saying..
- Yes.

1358
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,250
..that Sukhchan is
still in the village.

1359
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:17,666
They say they will catch him soon.

1360
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,708
Yes. Police will catch him.

1361
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,250
They don't spare anyone.

1362
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,625
They won't let him escape.

1363
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,291
Right, Jinder?

1364
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:26,458
That is the thing,
police won't let him escape.

1365
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:28,125
He is a scammer.

1366
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:32,166
Sukhchan brother, don't even
breathe for the next few minutes.

1367
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,875
We are about to pass
through the police station.

1368
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:36,166
There are policemen everywhere.

1369
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,208
This is the only unguarded path.

1370
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:40,250
From here we will
go directly to my house.

1371
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,333
Uncle, forget robbing the bank..

1372
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:46,041
..if they even have
an account here..

1373
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,791
..I bet you they will never
even come to withdraw money from it.

1374
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:49,916
Right, Meshi?

1375
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:52,166
I had this knee on his neck.

1376
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,666
My knee still aches.

1377
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:56,625
- I wonder how his neck is doing?
- Where were you two?

1378
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:58,583
Such a big disaster
happened in the village.

1379
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:01,666
- What happened? - Both bank and
the police station where under attack.

1380
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,125
Oh, really?

1381
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:04,500
When?

1382
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:06,333
Not even an hour ago.

1383
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:11,625
See, I had told you,
this bank can be robbed anytime.

1384
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:15,000
It happened just as I had predicted.

1385
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,250
Tell them.

1386
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,500
So did they take the money?

1387
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:18,750
No, no, no.

1388
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,041
Will Khundi let that happen?

1389
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:23,625
He and the manager caught them,
thrashed them and sent them away.

1390
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:24,875
You saw that?

1391
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:27,791
Khundi told me everything.

1392
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:29,500
I had to save the bank.

1393
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:32,000
I couldn't leave and just run away.
Right?

1394
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:36,291
Khundi, do you know who they were?

1395
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,125
Police will investigate.

1396
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:39,958
We didn't let it get robbed.

1397
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,375
They managed to
help Sukhchan escape.

1398
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:44,750
Why are you mixing the people..

1399
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:46,333
..who came for Sukhchan with
the people who robbed the bank?

1400
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:49,291
- Right.
- He had his knee on their neck.

1401
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:51,791
Why are you in this cart today?

1402
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:53,166
You didn't open your stall today?

1403
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:57,000
Uncle Labh asked us
to get fodder for him.

1404
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,500
- That's why.
- Yes.

1405
01:16:59,041 --> 01:17:01,083
Good that you weren't here.

1406
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:04,041
Ask Meshi how many
bullets were fired.

1407
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:05,708
If you were here you
would have ran for your life.

1408
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:08,208
Enough, Khundi. Stop bluffing.

1409
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,458
Don't make me get started.

1410
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:19,583
Hey!

1411
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,375
Yes, sir?

1412
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:40,791
Move the cart aside.

1413
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:44,000
Okay.

1414
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:45,708
Move, let's go, dear.

1415
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:48,041
Move. Go, go.

1416
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:06,208
Sir, this thingy belongs to him.

1417
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,416
It must have fallen
when he was running.

1418
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,458
Well done. Go, get me some tea.

1419
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:14,958
- Baint.
- Yes?

1420
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:16,291
Yes, sir?

1421
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:19,333
Do you think he must
have left this area as yet?

1422
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:20,708
Just asking.

1423
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:21,916
No.

1424
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:25,541
- He cannot survive without this, right?
- Yes.

1425
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:30,416
Inform all the medical
stores in this area..

1426
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:35,500
..that anyone who comes to purchase
an asthma pump and not a thingy..

1427
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:38,375
Anyone who comes to
purchase an asthma pump..

1428
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,250
They should let us know their name,
number and address.

1429
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:43,166
- Okay?
- Okay.

1430
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:44,583
- Go now.
- Sir.

1431
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:06,208
Here's your bottle, brother.

1432
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:08,625
My pump?

1433
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,791
Shops were closed.
We will get it tomorrow morning.

1434
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,875
How will I breathe?

1435
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:14,583
Like this.

1436
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,750
Breathe in from your nose
and breathe out like this.

1437
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:18,833
I'll slap you.

1438
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:20,458
I have asthma.

1439
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,625
I never know when I'll
get an asthma attack.

1440
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:24,041
That's when I need the pump.

1441
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,875
Brother, somehow manage
without it tonight.

1442
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:27,791
There are no doors
in my house anyway.

1443
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,791
Air comes directly inside.

1444
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:33,208
I don't understand,
why are you making me stay here.

1445
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:34,291
A place which doesn't
even have any doors.

1446
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,458
You will get me into trouble.

1447
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:38,000
Brother, you have scammed the
government of 500 million rupees.

1448
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:42,375
Think about this, will Sukhchan
ever stay at a place without doors?

1449
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:45,250
- No. - This is what
the police will think as well.

1450
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:54,416
Don't worry. It's a routine check.
I'll go and check.

1451
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:56,833
- Baint?
- Yes, sir?

1452
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,125
Take a constable with you
and find out who stays there.

1453
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,000
Okay, sir.

1454
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,208
Search each and every house. Go.

1455
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,250
What happened, sir?

1456
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,666
You know that criminal
Sukhchan has escaped.

1457
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:11,375
- Oh. Yes, yes.
- We want to search your house.

1458
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,958
He is inside, come in.

1459
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:14,791
He is crazy.

1460
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,416
I too just learn so.

1461
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:20,750
We didn't find him, sir.

1462
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:23,125
Shall we get in the cars, sir?

1463
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:32,833
They left.

1464
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:35,791
Are you crazy?

1465
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,291
You don't even realise
what you are saying.

1466
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,375
I won't stay with you.
You will get me into trouble.

1467
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:41,541
Calm down, brother.

1468
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:43,041
You don't even have
your asthma pump.

1469
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:44,500
I'll punch you.

1470
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:45,791
What were you telling him?

1471
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:49,458
Brother, I knew for sure that
if I invite him in, he'd never come.

1472
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:52,583
I've travelled in buses without
a ticket when I couldn't help it.

1473
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:53,791
I always used to get caught.

1474
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:55,125
Then I came up with a plan.

1475
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,375
Whenever I used to travel
in a bus without a ticket..

1476
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,625
..I used to raise my
hand and tell the checker..

1477
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,500
"Brother,
my ticket is in my pocket."

1478
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:03,125
"I am going to sleep.
You should check it."

1479
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,583
No one ever checked it.

1480
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:08,250
Brother, police officers and paternal
aunt's husband are of the same breed.

1481
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:11,000
They never do what
they are asked to do.

1482
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,500
You are very smart.

1483
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:18,291
Can't help it. God gave
me a bad fate with a sharp mind.

1484
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:21,666
Now I am trying to use
my mind and change my fate.

1485
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:23,625
You can plan whatever you want.

1486
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,958
But your first plan should
about getting me out of here.

1487
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:28,583
We are more worried
about our 50 million...

1488
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:30,458
..than you are about
your 500 million.

1489
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:32,708
Enjoy your drink.
Come Balli, I'll drop you home.

1490
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:37,250
Get the pump first
thing in the morning.

1491
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:40,166
Don't worry.
Consider it done. Got it?

1492
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:44,541
Uncle, how could I let
them steal from my bank?

1493
01:21:45,041 --> 01:21:47,083
- I took them to the back room
of the bank. - Okay.

1494
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,916
We didn't fight at all.

1495
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
But still,
they we begging me before they left.

1496
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:52,583
You should have beaten them up.

1497
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:53,833
I had.

1498
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:56,666
Son, I am impressed
by this feat of yours.

1499
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:58,958
Everyone is talking about you.

1500
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:01,166
Thank you. Yes.

1501
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,291
The bank staff is
recommending my name..

1502
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:04,916
..to the government
for bravery award.

1503
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:06,000
Wow.

1504
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:11,000
You can take it.

1505
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,875
It's my friend. I'll call her back.

1506
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:13,916
Okay.

1507
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,708
Do you know who the robbers were?

1508
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,625
Whoever they were,
they will never come back.

1509
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,250
Police is investigating.

1510
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:21,791
- Yes.
- They will soon get arrested.

1511
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,833
Have some biscuits.

1512
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:27,166
Daddy is only praising the manner
after yesterday's bank robbery.

1513
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,916
He is quite impressed
by his bravery.

1514
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,500
If the manager was so brave
how did the robbers escape?

1515
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:33,041
He wouldn't have let them escape.

1516
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,750
The bomb targeted at the police
station fell in the bank instead.

1517
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:37,458
They used that as cover and escaped.

1518
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:39,375
Otherwise, the manager
wouldn't have let them escaped.

1519
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:41,416
Will he say that in a Gurudwara?

1520
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,583
- Why? Is he lying?
- Yes, he is.

1521
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:46,291
You say as if you
witnessed the robbery.

1522
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:51,250
I didn't but you know
what someone can or cannot do.

1523
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:54,750
Tell your father not to
get too influenced by the manager.

1524
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:56,916
Daddy would get
influenced by you as well.

1525
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,958
But we never know
what you are up to.

1526
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:00,416
You still haven't done
anything about the shop.

1527
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:03,500
How do I tell you?
Everything is about to change.

1528
01:23:03,666 --> 01:23:06,125
Forget a shop,
I'll get you a palace.

1529
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:08,625
Just get the shop,
that will be a palace for me.

1530
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,583
I can really get a palace.

1531
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:11,958
I am no longer the same Shinda.

1532
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:13,791
Your father is going
after the bank manager.

1533
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:15,791
I will open my own bank.

1534
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:17,541
We are going to get
a lot of money, my love.

1535
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:19,541
Let's go.

1536
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:45,375
"Whenever I see you,
my heart skips a beat."

1537
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:55,916
"A glance by you.. shatters me."

1538
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,083
"You make me fear for my life,
this is not right."

1539
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:06,208
"You make me fear for my life,
this is not right."

1540
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,791
"You stop me and
just ask for my heart.."

1541
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:13,916
"You stop me and just ask
for my heart, this is not right."

1542
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:19,500
"You stop me and just ask
for my heart, this is not right."

1543
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:33,250
"From the time I have seen you,
I feel restless."

1544
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:38,000
"The attitude you possesses,
my dear.."

1545
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:41,875
"You have made me go crazy."

1546
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:47,083
"Now all day,
I only think about you."

1547
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:52,208
"Now my life is dependent on you."

1548
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:57,333
"Now my life is dependent on you."

1549
01:24:57,458 --> 01:25:02,625
"Now all day,
I only think about you."

1550
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:16,708
"My eyes are intoxicating."

1551
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:21,833
"You make my life more beautiful."

1552
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:25,791
"My eyes are intoxicating."

1553
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:29,250
"You make my life more beautiful."

1554
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:31,833
"You steal my heart away.."

1555
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:36,541
"You steal my heart away,
you smile in such a way."

1556
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:41,916
"Now my life is dependent on you."

1557
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,541
"You stop me and
just ask for my heart.."

1558
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:49,666
"You stop me and just ask
for my heart, this is not right."

1559
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:54,833
"Now my life is dependent on you."

1560
01:25:54,916 --> 01:26:00,333
"Now all day,
I only think about you."

1561
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:03,291
You keep saying that
you will get a lot of money.

1562
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:04,750
At least tell me where
will you get it from.

1563
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,541
There is a good
man who is helping us.

1564
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:09,375
I'll tell you everything
once I get the money.

1565
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,000
You misdialled me.

1566
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:15,000
Balli has my phone. It must be him.

1567
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:18,250
- Yes, Balli?
- Shinda, we have a problem.

1568
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:20,250
Police has asked
all medicinal shops..

1569
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:23,250
..to note down the name,
address, village, and phone number..

1570
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:25,375
..if anyone comes to
purchase an asthma pump.

1571
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,750
I hope you didn't
give them the details.

1572
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:29,041
No, I didn't.
We barely escaped, brother.

1573
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:30,625
But you should come
here immediately.

1574
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,625
I am coming.

1575
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:34,041
What happened? Everything okay?

1576
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:36,041
Yes, everything is fine.
But I will need to leave.

1577
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,125
I have some work.
I'll see you later.

1578
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:39,958
- Shinda?
- I'll see you later.

1579
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:52,291
- Here you go.
- Okay.

1580
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:56,458
- Morning, afternoon and evening.
- Okay.

1581
01:26:57,583 --> 01:27:00,583
We can give him the
cycle pump to breathe.

1582
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:02,333
Why did you bring me
all the way to the city?

1583
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:04,958
We would get into trouble
by purchasing a pump in the village.

1584
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:06,916
Yes, what do you want?

1585
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:09,125
Brother, I forgot
the name of the medicine.

1586
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:11,041
I'll tell you as soon
as I get a message from home.

1587
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:12,125
Okay.

1588
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:17,291
- No asthma patient has come as yet.
- Keep quiet.

1589
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,750
Take this.

1590
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,791
- Brother, give me an asthma pump.
- Okay.

1591
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:24,708
Here you go.

1592
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:27,750
Give me your name,
address and telephone number.

1593
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,333
- Why?
- Orders from the police.

1594
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:30,916
- Really?
- Yes.

1595
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,083
- Okay then also give me a cough syrup.
- Okay.

1596
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:36,166
I got a message from home.
We need Crocin tablets.

1597
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:38,125
- I'll give it.
- Brother, what is this?

1598
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:40,541
It is for people who
have breathing problem.

1599
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:42,583
Breathing problems..

1600
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,000
Brother!

1601
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:46,166
What have you done! Couldn't
you keep your hands to yourself?

1602
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,791
Brother, what have my hands done?
It came under my feet.

1603
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:50,458
You made me suffer a loss.

1604
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:53,041
Don't be angry, brother.
We will purchase it, okay?

1605
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:56,375
This for the crocin tablets. Okay?

1606
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,666
Kids at home will play with it.

1607
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,541
- Take your 20 rupees change.
- It's okay.

1608
01:27:59,666 --> 01:28:00,666
You can keep the change, brother.

1609
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:03,291
Why is it so out of shape?

1610
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,958
- We risked our lives to bring it.
- Yes.

1611
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,916
Okay.

1612
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:13,208
Brother, I wanted to ask,
by when can we get the money?

1613
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:15,375
Don't worry about the money.

1614
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:17,375
After I leave the village..

1615
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,416
..one of my men will
come and give you the money.

1616
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:22,125
But what if your
man doesn't show up?

1617
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:24,166
Then get me back.

1618
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:26,041
You still haven't made
me leave the village..

1619
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:27,333
..and you are already
worried about your money.

1620
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:29,583
I am promising you..

1621
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,583
..that your money
is safe at my home.

1622
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:35,875
You will get the money
as soon as I leave the village.

1623
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,291
We can take him from here as well.

1624
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,541
Lalaji is calling.

1625
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:50,250
- Yes, Lalaji?
- Where are you, Shinda?

1626
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:52,250
When will we register the house?

1627
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:54,041
We are stuck in some important work.

1628
01:28:54,125 --> 01:28:55,958
- We will do it in a few days.
- Right.

1629
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:58,375
Do it and get your job done.
And take your money.

1630
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,541
Okay.

1631
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:01,208
Why do we need to
sell the house now?

1632
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,666
Let us get the money.

1633
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:04,666
We will be able to treat Simran
and set up a business as well.

1634
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,875
Why don't you speak a little louder so
that all the villagers can hear you?

1635
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:08,958
- But I am right, aren't I?
- Like hell, you are right.

1636
01:29:11,541 --> 01:29:14,916
'Police was looking for Sukhchan
at every nook and corner.'

1637
01:29:20,166 --> 01:29:23,250
'And Balli and Shinda
were trying to find a way..'

1638
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:25,375
'..to get Sukhchan
out of the village.'

1639
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:53,333
Shinda.

1640
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:56,333
1 million.

1641
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:58,458
Why do we have to get
him out of the village?

1642
01:29:58,583 --> 01:29:59,541
Let us hand him over to the police.

1643
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:00,791
We will immediately
get 1 million rupees.

1644
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:01,916
He wants the reward!

1645
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:04,291
We will get punished for hiding him.

1646
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:05,500
Let's go.

1647
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,875
Brother, this is for you.

1648
01:30:30,583 --> 01:30:32,000
No, I don't drink on Thursdays.

1649
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:33,041
Why?

1650
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:35,166
I worship the Murshid Pirs.

1651
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:39,083
But you scammed the government
of 500 million on a Thursday.

1652
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:40,041
Yes.

1653
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,833
Hey, don't joke about the saints.

1654
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:47,291
Brother, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

1655
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:48,000
Tell me.

1656
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,791
If you could let us talk to the
person who will give us the money..?

1657
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,541
We poor souls would feel assured.

1658
01:30:54,666 --> 01:30:56,666
Then we would work harder.

1659
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,958
- Give me the phone.
- Give it here.

1660
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,166
Yes, brother?

1661
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:04,541
Suraj..

1662
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,416
You do the role of Ravana so well.

1663
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,000
Oh thank you, bro.

1664
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:09,625
Amazing.

1665
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:11,416
I want to go abroad.

1666
01:31:11,625 --> 01:31:13,541
I am preparing for IELTS.

1667
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:16,208
Bye, I'll get going now.
I am so tired.

1668
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:17,875
I have to work hard all afternoon.

1669
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:18,916
Sit.

1670
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:20,583
Sit with us for a while, brother.

1671
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,541
How much money does
the Ramleela team give you?

1672
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:25,083
Hardly anything.

1673
01:31:25,166 --> 01:31:26,166
It's a free service.

1674
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,375
Then why don't you help us as well?

1675
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,125
We will pay you 100,000 rupees.

1676
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:32,416
Why are you lying to
me after getting drunk?

1677
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:35,125
I told you I am tired. Let me go.

1678
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,500
Wait, wait, wait.

1679
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:39,250
Do you know him?

1680
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:44,875
Sukhchan.

1681
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:55,875
In short, on Dushera day,
we'll make Sukhchan dress up..

1682
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:59,333
..as Ravana instead of you
and help him leave the village.

1683
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,000
Wonderful.

1684
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,958
Police is giving a reward
of 1 million to catch him.

1685
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:06,375
I am not crazy to
take 100,000 from you.

1686
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,250
Like hell police will
give you the reward.

1687
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:10,583
They don't get salaries
for two months at a stretch.

1688
01:32:10,708 --> 01:32:13,958
True. And these posters
were printed by the government.

1689
01:32:14,041 --> 01:32:16,625
Police didn't even pay the
ones who glued them to the walls.

1690
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:18,125
They had to pay for the
glue too out of their pockets.

1691
01:32:18,208 --> 01:32:20,000
And you dollars from them.

1692
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:25,500
But you won't gain any
help if you get only me involved.

1693
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:29,375
What if the boy who does
my makeup tells everyone?

1694
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:34,291
I will charge 200,000 rupees.
Otherwise, I will tell everyone.

1695
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:37,250
You do Shah Rukh Khan's makeup?

1696
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:38,458
He wants 200,000 rupees!

1697
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,250
I don't know about Shah Rukh Khan.

1698
01:32:40,333 --> 01:32:41,500
It's very simple.

1699
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,083
You are giving 100,000 to a nobody.

1700
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:45,875
I deserve to get 200,000 rupees.

1701
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:47,708
Will you pay or should
I tell everyone?

1702
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:51,458
Shinda, pay him what he wants.

1703
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:53,916
Such people are very unpredictable.
He might tell everyone.

1704
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
We will be left with quite a
lot even after giving away 300,000.

1705
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:01,625
Done.

1706
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,875
Okay, I'll whatsapp
my account number then.

1707
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:06,333
Oh yes, you will have
to do one more thing.

1708
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:09,291
This Ravana interacts
with all artists.

1709
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,541
Rama, Lakshmana,
Sita, Angad, Kumbhkaran.

1710
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:12,833
With everyone. Okay?

1711
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:15,250
Anyone of them could find
out that Ravana has changed.

1712
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:17,541
That's why you need to
get the Ramleela's head as well.

1713
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:19,041
So that this thing
doesn't get exposed.

1714
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:21,291
Take a book and a pen.

1715
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:23,583
You keep recording
who needs to be paid what.

1716
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:24,875
What needs to be paid to whom.

1717
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,166
100,000 for Neeta.

1718
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:29,041
100,000 for Mindha.

1719
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:31,416
100,000 for Boota.
And 100,000 for Changeda.

1720
01:33:31,791 --> 01:33:34,041
Sir, if we have to
give everyone 100,000..

1721
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:35,333
..then what's the use
of giving you 500,000?

1722
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:39,208
I am charging 500,000
so that they stay in check.

1723
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:41,250
Or else they might open their
mouth even after taking the money.

1724
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:43,250
- How much?
- 3.7 million.

1725
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:45,541
You never donated 5 rupees to them.

1726
01:33:45,666 --> 01:33:47,208
And now you are
giving them millions.

1727
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:48,500
They know now.

1728
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:49,750
We will get into trouble
if we don't pay them.

1729
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,291
It's just 3.7 million.

1730
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:52,791
It's not like we worked hard for it.

1731
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:54,833
Brother, what are
you two whispering about?

1732
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:55,916
Tell us, do we have a deal?

1733
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:58,666
You will get the money.
You tell us how to go about this.

1734
01:33:58,791 --> 01:34:00,000
There isn't much to do then.

1735
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:02,958
Ask that goon to memorise
Ravana's dialogues.

1736
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:05,958
I am Lakeshwar!

1737
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:07,791
I am a part of the sky!

1738
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:11,041
I am a part of the earth!
I am a part of the netherworld!

1739
01:34:11,166 --> 01:34:12,125
What's next?

1740
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:15,541
You are at a few more places
but I cannot read Sanskrit.

1741
01:34:15,666 --> 01:34:17,708
If you cannot even
read it how do I say it?

1742
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,666
- Read what's next.
- What's next?

1743
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:21,125
H-A-H-A..

1744
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:23,333
It's not H-A-H-A,
it means laugh like a Ravana.

1745
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:27,166
I cannot do this.
Find another way.

1746
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:29,208
Brother, this is the easiest way.

1747
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:30,458
The security is quite tight.

1748
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:32,666
Policemen are even checking
pregnant buffalos stomach..

1749
01:34:32,791 --> 01:34:34,291
..just in case you
are hiding in there.

1750
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:35,541
- Right?
- Yes.

1751
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:40,416
What's next?

1752
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:52,875
Is the Ravana ready?

1753
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:54,458
- He is getting his makeup done.
- Fine.

1754
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:58,500
In half an hour Hanuman
will come to pick him up.

1755
01:34:58,583 --> 01:35:00,375
- Shall I drop him?
- No, no, no.

1756
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:03,875
Ravana will mingle with the
Ramleela actors and leave easily.

1757
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:06,583
If you drop him then everyone's
attention will be on him.

1758
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:08,916
You quickly go and
get his makeup done.

1759
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,791
Okay.

1760
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:11,333
- Ready?
- Yes.

1761
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:12,125
Go then.

1762
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:15,916
Suraj, we will meet at
the city bypass in three hours.

1763
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,958
Okay? Yes.

1764
01:35:17,041 --> 01:35:19,041
- Have you taken the costume?
- Yes.

1765
01:35:19,166 --> 01:35:19,958
I have it in the bag. - Okay.

1766
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:22,333
- Shall I leave?
- Yes. Go, go, go. Hurry up.

1767
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:24,208
Balli?

1768
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:27,708
Makeup, no one should
know who he is..

1769
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:28,875
..otherwise,
everyone will get arrested.

1770
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:30,958
I just spent two months in prison.

1771
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,541
Please don't say such things.

1772
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:34,833
You leave and let him
do his work confidently.

1773
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:36,208
- You continue.
- Okay.

1774
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:38,000
Keep that down.

1775
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:39,375
That sword is as big as him.

1776
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:41,750
There are just a few hours
left for our poverty to end.

1777
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:43,041
I think Hanuman is here.

1778
01:35:43,541 --> 01:35:44,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

1779
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:46,333
- Where is he?
- Just five minutes.

1780
01:35:46,458 --> 01:35:50,125
Shinda Singh, what are the
Ramleela actors doing in your house?

1781
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:52,125
How does it concern you?
I have invited them for lunch.

1782
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:54,208
You have lunch at
other people's home.

1783
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:55,333
How can you invite them?

1784
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:57,333
My father was Rama's devotee.

1785
01:35:57,416 --> 01:35:59,833
He used to say that he wants to
invite the Ramleela actors for lunch.

1786
01:35:59,916 --> 01:36:01,458
- I have heard that as well.
- Yes.

1787
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:02,833
Right, we have to
do it for the dead.

1788
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:04,083
Yes, you have to do it.
So, we are doing it.

1789
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:05,166
- Please leave.
- Fine.

1790
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,708
Always seeking hot gossip topic.

1791
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:08,166
Fine, we are leaving.

1792
01:36:08,291 --> 01:36:10,291
Start the scooter,
I'll send him in five minutes.

1793
01:36:10,375 --> 01:36:11,708
- Okay.
- Kick-start it.

1794
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:23,833
Hurry up.
How much more time will it take?

1795
01:36:23,916 --> 01:36:26,000
We are about to reach, brother.

1796
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,791
Where are you taking him?

1797
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:29,333
He isn't going to survive today.

1798
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:31,750
Don't worry,
they are talking about the Ravana..

1799
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,250
..we will set on
fire today on Dushera.

1800
01:36:47,583 --> 01:36:48,916
So, what's the arrangement?

1801
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,583
Sir, 15 guards are on Dushera duty.

1802
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:58,083
Six out of them will go with the
artists' chariots leaving the village.

1803
01:36:58,416 --> 01:37:00,208
Why will they be
leaving the village?

1804
01:37:00,291 --> 01:37:02,916
Sir, four villagers come
together and arrange this Ramleela.

1805
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:07,166
Before they burn the Ravana,
each chariot visits one village.

1806
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:10,083
All hail Lord Rama!

1807
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,291
Okay. It will be quite
crowded so stay alert.

1808
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:16,375
I think he will take advantage
of the crowd and try to escape.

1809
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:18,333
Who?

1810
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:21,958
Sukhchan.

1811
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:23,708
- I know.
- What?

1812
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:26,375
Is everything going
according to plan?

1813
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:27,750
Don't worry.

1814
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,916
- Everything is going according to plan.
- Leave now.

1815
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:34,916
I think they all are
came for burn the Ravana.

1816
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:44,333
'All hail Lord Rama!'

1817
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:47,791
'All hail Sita Mata!'

1818
01:37:48,041 --> 01:37:51,125
'All hail Hanuman!'

1819
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:57,500
'All hail Ravana!'

1820
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:05,875
- Be alert, Baint.
- Yes, sir.

1821
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:07,000
I am watching every moment, sir.

1822
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:09,250
I have two cameras recording
everything as well.

1823
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:14,958
According to the list provided
by the head of the committee..

1824
01:38:15,041 --> 01:38:18,166
..they have 22 actors
and 31 backstage help.

1825
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:20,583
- Did you count them?
- Yes, sir.

1826
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:23,416
I have a guard there as well.

1827
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:25,000
I have counted them.

1828
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:30,208
'To keep supporting us so that we
can keep entertaining the villagers.'

1829
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:33,666
'All hail Lord Rama!'

1830
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:36,708
Lakshwar, your time is up.

1831
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:39,916
The only punishment
you deserve it death.

1832
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,083
Nothing else.

1833
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:44,666
'All hail Lord Rama!'

1834
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:49,125
Rama, Lakeshwar was immortal,
is immortal and will stay immortal.

1835
01:38:49,583 --> 01:38:52,041
He will stay immortal!

1836
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:54,750
Lakeshwar will always
remain immortal!

1837
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:57,333
'All hail Lord Rama!'

1838
01:38:57,541 --> 01:39:00,375
'All hail Lord Rama!'

1839
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:01,958
All hail Lord Rama!

1840
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:03,416
All hail Lord Rama!

1841
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:04,875
- Sir?
- Yes?

1842
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:06,750
- You tell me.
- What?

1843
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:08,375
Hail to...

1844
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:15,125
Egoistic Ravana,
it is not your fault.

1845
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:18,291
God doesn't want
this clan in this world.

1846
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:21,500
That's why it is certain
that you will die today.

1847
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:23,625
And it is bound to happen.

1848
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:26,375
How dare you! How dare you!

1849
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:27,500
Sir!

1850
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:34,541
Move aside.

1851
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:38,375
- Don't fight.
- Leave him. Listen to me.

1852
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:39,750
Here he comes.

1853
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:43,875
He is here to pee. At least
wait for him to finish peeing.

1854
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:46,666
One, two, three four, five.
Go.

1855
01:39:46,791 --> 01:39:50,375
You did a good job.
You should leave from here.

1856
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:51,500
Brother, our money?

1857
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,041
One of my men will come and pay you.

1858
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:54,416
Don't worry about the money.
You should leave from here.

1859
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:56,666
But I need the money right now.

1860
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:58,166
Please trust me.

1861
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:00,458
Don't worry about the money.
You should leave from here.

1862
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:02,375
- Go, go, go.
- Don't forget.

1863
01:40:03,791 --> 01:40:05,500
All hail Lord Rama!

1864
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:10,750
Sir, this is yesterday's
report from the chemist shops.

1865
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:13,875
Sir. 16 pumps were sold
in 41 shops in the area.

1866
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,833
- Baint!
- Yes, sir.

1867
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:18,375
Are you checking the
records of the shops?

1868
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,875
Yes. Of course.

1869
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:21,083
It is right.

1870
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:24,375
All those who bought the
pumps are undergoing treatment.

1871
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:28,458
We have also enquired
about a new purchase.

1872
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,666
I personally did it.

1873
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:31,125
He has asthma.

1874
01:40:31,208 --> 01:40:32,458
How do you know that?

1875
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:35,083
Sir, we woke him
up and made him run.

1876
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:36,375
He was out of breath.

1877
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:38,500
We gave him the pump
and he felt better.

1878
01:40:39,458 --> 01:40:40,791
I don't understand.

1879
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:45,000
How can a person like Sukhchan survive
for five days without his asthma pump?

1880
01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:47,458
Sir, we reached five days' records.

1881
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:48,958
- Okay.
- Everything else is fine.

1882
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:52,125
A shop owner wrote a
name and then cancelled it.

1883
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:53,375
Why?

1884
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:55,791
Sir, a customer asked
for it by mistake.

1885
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,250
He later said he
wanted something else.

1886
01:40:58,416 --> 01:40:59,666
That's why I deleted his name.

1887
01:40:59,791 --> 01:41:01,791
'Actually, there was some
misunderstanding by my wife.'

1888
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:03,500
'We need a medicine for an allergy.'

1889
01:41:08,375 --> 01:41:09,583
And who was this customer?

1890
01:41:09,708 --> 01:41:11,416
Balli, from our village.

1891
01:41:11,583 --> 01:41:13,291
He has a mobile repair shop.

1892
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,375
Sir, we have sold 16 pumps so far.

1893
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,291
Here is the list.

1894
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:24,250
There are only 15
people in this list.

1895
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:26,833
Sir, one customer was
playing with the pump.

1896
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:28,291
He broke it.

1897
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:29,875
Then he had to buy it.

1898
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:33,125
- Do you know him?
- No, I don't know him.

1899
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:35,333
But I can recognise
him if he comes before me.

1900
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,791
Idea. Show him Balli's photo.

1901
01:41:37,875 --> 01:41:39,000
Okay, sir.

1902
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:42,250
Yes, sir. It was him.

1903
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:44,166
There was another man with him.

1904
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,708
Sir, Shinda is always with Balli.

1905
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:46,958
It might be him.

1906
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:49,500
He is the one, sir.

1907
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:55,500
They don't look like criminals.

1908
01:41:55,625 --> 01:41:58,208
Sir, usually the ones who
look innocent do such things.

1909
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:05,416
Get into the jeep.

1910
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:08,208
Yes, yes. Move in.

1911
01:42:25,041 --> 01:42:27,125
Come on, everyone. Let's go.

1912
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:31,166
- Some of you go upstairs and check.
- Okay, sir.

1913
01:42:31,583 --> 01:42:32,625
- Check this room.
- Okay, sir.

1914
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:33,666
- Find out if it's the kitchen or what?
- Okay, sir.

1915
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:35,291
- Two of you go there. Go.
- Okay, sir.

1916
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,916
- You, go upstairs.
- Okay.

1917
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:39,916
Hurry up.

1918
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,458
Come on.

1919
01:42:46,708 --> 01:42:47,833
Sir.

1920
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:58,750
Yes?

1921
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:00,583
Why did you take so
long to open the door?

1922
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,166
My daughter is unwell.

1923
01:43:02,416 --> 01:43:03,333
That's why.

1924
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:06,583
- Where is Balli?
- What happened?

1925
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:09,500
Where is Balli?
He wasn't at his stall today.

1926
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:11,000
He must be here somewhere.

1927
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:13,541
He said he would go for the Dushera

1928
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:16,666
His daughter is unwell
and he wants to visit the fair?

1929
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:17,916
He must be on his way back.

1930
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:19,833
He said he had come important work.

1931
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:21,458
He will come back soon.

1932
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,041
Hello.

1933
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:37,541
Sir, the Ramleela's chariots
came back as they had left.

1934
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:39,166
We have called their head here.

1935
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:41,083
He said he will come here as
soon as they set the Ravana on fire.

1936
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:42,708
Do you know Balli and Shinda?

1937
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:44,041
Yes, I know.

1938
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:45,458
Since when are they
associated with Ramleela?

1939
01:43:45,583 --> 01:43:46,541
Since two days?

1940
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:47,541
Why did they join the troupe?

1941
01:43:48,125 --> 01:43:49,458
I don't know, sir.

1942
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:51,333
I came after two days.

1943
01:43:51,666 --> 01:43:53,458
But one thing is surely surprising.

1944
01:43:53,541 --> 01:43:55,833
They used to never
even donate 10 rupees.

1945
01:43:55,916 --> 01:43:58,041
Why are they going around
with the Ramleela actors?

1946
01:43:58,583 --> 01:44:01,041
Sir, let's go to the
Dushera ground and get them.

1947
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:02,625
It's quite late.

1948
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,791
They all must have set
the Ravana on fire and left.

1949
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:08,125
You will find them all
at the Ramleela club now.

1950
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,958
Sir, please try to understand.

1951
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:12,541
We aren't going anywhere.

1952
01:44:12,833 --> 01:44:16,333
We will pay you as soon as
Sukhchan's man gives us the money.

1953
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,583
We trusted him. You should trust us.

1954
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:20,708
Don't just say hmm, say something.

1955
01:44:20,791 --> 01:44:23,250
Suraj, we have been in
this village since so many years.

1956
01:44:23,333 --> 01:44:24,375
Have we ever done anything wrong?

1957
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,375
Except for helping Sukhchan.

1958
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:27,458
Let's leave quickly.

1959
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:29,750
Why leave? Let's resolve this issue.

1960
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:31,583
- Police.
- Oh damn.

1961
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:32,625
Please handle the situation,
brother.

1962
01:44:32,708 --> 01:44:33,875
What happened?

1963
01:44:42,541 --> 01:44:44,041
Where are Balli and Shinda?

1964
01:44:44,125 --> 01:44:46,375
They were here.
They just left.

1965
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:47,583
You are the head?

1966
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,541
What? Yes, sir. Yes.

1967
01:44:49,625 --> 01:44:52,500
- Where is Sukhchan?
- What? Who? Who is Sukhchan?

1968
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:54,166
The one you help
get out of the village.

1969
01:44:54,916 --> 01:44:56,416
We are telling the truth, sir.

1970
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:58,541
We don't know any Sukhchan. Okay?

1971
01:44:58,708 --> 01:45:00,375
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

1972
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:01,541
No problem, sir.

1973
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:04,541
I have recorded
everything in the camera.

1974
01:45:04,916 --> 01:45:05,750
Very good, Baint.

1975
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:06,958
- Thank you, sir.
- It's okay.

1976
01:45:07,041 --> 01:45:08,875
- Get them all into the jeeps.
- Yes, sir.

1977
01:45:08,958 --> 01:45:11,041
Let's steal their happiness
and peace of mind at least.

1978
01:45:11,166 --> 01:45:12,041
Yes, sir.

1979
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:14,458
Stop right here.

1980
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:16,666
- Rewind it.
- Okay.

1981
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:18,791
Before that.

1982
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,333
- Yes, pause it.
- Okay.

1983
01:45:25,625 --> 01:45:27,458
- Who is Ravana?
- What?

1984
01:45:28,958 --> 01:45:30,250
Suraj, sir.

1985
01:45:32,916 --> 01:45:36,541
Take him inside and
show him the sun, the moon..

1986
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:41,375
..the stars and the whole universe.

1987
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,375
Okay, sir.

1988
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:43,375
Let's go.

1989
01:45:43,541 --> 01:45:45,000
Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1990
01:45:45,125 --> 01:45:47,125
Sir! Sir, please let me go.

1991
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,958
I'll tell you the truth.

1992
01:45:49,416 --> 01:45:51,125
I'll tell you the truth.

1993
01:45:51,708 --> 01:45:53,125
I am not alone.

1994
01:45:53,291 --> 01:45:54,625
All of us are involved.

1995
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:10,250
- Where is Balli?
- I don't know.

1996
01:46:10,625 --> 01:46:13,125
I keep calling him
but he isn't answering.

1997
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:15,000
Our daughter is seriously ill.

1998
01:46:15,166 --> 01:46:18,291
We just called for
the institute's ambulance.

1999
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:19,708
Take her.

2000
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:27,166
Sir. Shinda didn't
come to his house.

2001
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,583
Balli too didn't come to his house.

2002
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:31,000
Search the whole village.

2003
01:46:31,208 --> 01:46:33,000
Okay, I'll do something.

2004
01:46:35,416 --> 01:46:36,166
Who was it?

2005
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:38,375
Lalaji, the one whom
I sold my house told.

2006
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:40,708
Police is looking for us.

2007
01:46:40,833 --> 01:46:42,041
What had we thought
that what happened.

2008
01:46:42,166 --> 01:46:44,041
- Everything is over.
- Why do you worry?

2009
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:47,041
Take my motorcycle, get Gurmeet
and Simran and leave the village.

2010
01:46:47,916 --> 01:46:49,458
- What about you?
- Why do you worry about me?

2011
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:50,375
I'll join you later.

2012
01:46:50,458 --> 01:46:51,458
You should first
think about your family.

2013
01:46:51,583 --> 01:46:53,625
- I won't leave without you.
- I'll slap you.

2014
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:55,416
I told you, leave!
Take the phone.

2015
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,208
Go. I said leave.

2016
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:06,708
'Neither did Sukhchan's
man come here nor did the money.'

2017
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:10,833
'Balli and Shinda keep hiding here
and there to escape the police.'

2018
01:47:34,416 --> 01:47:35,416
Hello, Gurmeet?

2019
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:36,500
Balli, where are you?

2020
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:37,958
I am outside the house.
Where are you?

2021
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:40,625
I am at the hospital.
Our daughter's condition got worse.

2022
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:42,041
Come here as soon as possible.

2023
01:47:58,041 --> 01:47:59,833
- You two keep an eye there.
- Look over there.

2024
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:01,916
Get him! Don't let him escape.

2025
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,833
Come on, let's get him.

2026
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:10,458
Stop!

2027
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:12,500
Yes. Okay.

2028
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:14,041
Yes, okay.

2029
01:49:14,708 --> 01:49:17,125
Sir, we have managed to trace
Shinda and Balli's phone numbers.

2030
01:49:17,208 --> 01:49:20,458
Both of them were found
entering the Moga city together.

2031
01:49:20,583 --> 01:49:22,625
Then both their phones
where switched off.

2032
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:24,916
I want to talk to the station
in-charge of the Moga police station.

2033
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:26,000
Okay, sir.

2034
01:49:30,291 --> 01:49:31,625
What is wrong?
Why are you late today?

2035
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:34,083
What do I say, sir?

2036
01:49:34,166 --> 01:49:35,791
There is a problem in our village.

2037
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:37,041
What problem?

2038
01:49:37,166 --> 01:49:38,916
- Sukhchan who had escaped
from our village.. - Yes?

2039
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,875
Balli and Shinda
had helped him escape.

2040
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:43,750
- Shinda?
- Yes.

2041
01:50:08,041 --> 01:50:10,916
Where the hell is Balli?
He has switched off his phone.

2042
01:50:17,458 --> 01:50:18,416
Hello?

2043
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:19,791
Lali, it's me Shinda.

2044
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:21,625
Yes, tell me.

2045
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:23,125
Lali, I wanted to
tell you something.

2046
01:50:23,208 --> 01:50:24,625
I too wanted to tell you something.

2047
01:50:25,583 --> 01:50:27,291
Don't call me ever again, Shinda.

2048
01:50:27,666 --> 01:50:29,750
- Listen to me, Lali.
- No, Shinda.

2049
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,625
I always listened to you.

2050
01:50:33,166 --> 01:50:34,416
It's okay.

2051
01:50:35,125 --> 01:50:37,250
I just wasted some time of my life.

2052
01:50:37,375 --> 01:50:39,208
But I learnt a lot from you.

2053
01:50:39,291 --> 01:50:41,375
One should never trust anyone.

2054
01:50:41,791 --> 01:50:44,000
- Lali, I..
- Police is tracking your phone.

2055
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:46,333
They are perhaps also tracking mine.

2056
01:50:46,916 --> 01:50:48,166
Don't call me up ever again.

2057
01:50:48,291 --> 01:50:49,750
You have made me
break our relationship.

2058
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,083
Now at least let me
honourably marry someone else.

2059
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:55,083
Lali.. Lali!

2060
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:13,833
"The instrument of fate.."

2061
01:51:13,916 --> 01:51:19,000
"Drowned so close to the shore."

2062
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:24,583
"Why, God?"

2063
01:51:25,041 --> 01:51:31,208
"Oh God.."

2064
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,500
"The instrument of fate.."

2065
01:51:37,875 --> 01:51:42,958
"Drowned so close to the shore."

2066
01:51:43,833 --> 01:51:54,416
"I lived for no reason..
on its support."

2067
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:58,625
"Dreams that break easily.."

2068
01:51:58,791 --> 01:52:01,541
"Dreams which cannot
be mended back together.."

2069
01:52:01,625 --> 01:52:07,083
"No one should have such dreams."

2070
01:52:07,166 --> 01:52:11,541
"No one special should
ever come into my life, oh God."

2071
01:52:13,041 --> 01:52:18,041
"If one comes,
then should never leave, oh God."

2072
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:24,583
"If someone intends
to make me cry later.."

2073
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:29,375
"Then that person shouldn't
make me laugh, oh God."

2074
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:37,166
"No one special should
ever come into my life, oh God."

2075
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:14,291
"Shattered pieces of my heart,
take your name."

2076
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:31,833
"Shattered pieces of my heart,
take your name."

2077
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:35,541
"You paid me no heed."

2078
01:53:35,666 --> 01:53:38,666
"You didn't take pity on me."

2079
01:53:38,791 --> 01:53:43,458
"I had to endure the
pain of separation alone."

2080
01:53:43,833 --> 01:53:48,333
"It is difficult to survive."

2081
01:53:48,416 --> 01:53:51,291
"My heart weeps day and night."

2082
01:53:51,375 --> 01:53:56,750
"No one should trouble
me so much, oh God."

2083
01:53:56,875 --> 01:54:00,875
"No one special should
ever come into my life, oh God."

2084
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:07,833
"If one comes,
then should never leave, oh God."

2085
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:14,375
"If someone intends
to make me cry later.."

2086
01:54:14,458 --> 01:54:18,958
"Then that person shouldn't
make me laugh, oh God."

2087
01:54:20,125 --> 01:54:26,958
"No one special should
ever come into my life, oh God."

2088
01:54:37,958 --> 01:54:43,708
"Oh God.."

2089
01:54:43,833 --> 01:54:50,458
"My Lord.."

2090
01:54:55,125 --> 01:54:56,166
Where are you, Balli?

2091
01:54:56,291 --> 01:54:58,458
I keep hiding here and there.

2092
01:54:58,583 --> 01:55:01,041
Shinda, Simran is unwell.

2093
01:55:01,125 --> 01:55:02,416
She has been hospitalised.

2094
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:03,916
Her condition is very critical.

2095
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:05,708
Don't worry. We will do something.

2096
01:55:05,833 --> 01:55:06,833
Do whatever you have to, brother.

2097
01:55:06,958 --> 01:55:09,375
But I will go to the
hospital to meet my daughter.

2098
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:10,625
I don't care if
the police arrests me.

2099
01:55:10,833 --> 01:55:14,166
Balli, there is only one way
to redeem from the mistake we made.

2100
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:16,750
We'll have to capture Sukhchan
and hand him over to the police.

2101
01:55:16,875 --> 01:55:17,916
But where will we find him?

2102
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,250
We will have to do something, Balli.

2103
01:55:19,416 --> 01:55:21,750
We cannot fight with
God for giving us a bad fate.

2104
01:55:21,958 --> 01:55:23,625
We will have to fight with fate.

2105
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:24,791
Forget about fate.

2106
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:27,916
I read in the newspaper that police
didn't even spare the Ramleela artists.

2107
01:55:28,166 --> 01:55:29,250
Take care of yourself.

2108
01:55:29,416 --> 01:55:30,416
I am hanging up now.

2109
01:55:30,541 --> 01:55:32,833
Lali was saying that
they are tracking our phones.

2110
01:55:38,125 --> 01:55:39,250
Trying to escape the police?

2111
01:55:39,416 --> 01:55:40,500
Where's your partner?

2112
01:55:40,916 --> 01:55:42,833
I got separated from
Shinda in the village itself.

2113
01:55:42,916 --> 01:55:43,875
You are lying.

2114
01:55:44,166 --> 01:55:46,708
Get him in the jeep and
search his house as well.

2115
01:55:46,833 --> 01:55:47,458
Okay, sir.

2116
01:55:47,541 --> 01:55:49,000
He says they got separated
in the village itself.

2117
01:55:49,458 --> 01:55:52,250
In the phone tracking your
numbers place you at the same place.

2118
01:55:52,375 --> 01:55:54,208
We have two sims in one phone.

2119
01:55:54,291 --> 01:55:56,291
I'll teach you a lesson
on that in the police station.

2120
01:55:56,541 --> 01:55:57,500
Hold him.

2121
01:56:01,916 --> 01:56:03,333
'I don't drink on Thursdays.'

2122
01:56:03,458 --> 01:56:04,416
'Why?'

2123
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,208
'I worship the Murshid Pirs.'

2124
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:22,625
'Shinda was on his way
to Murshid Pirs' shrine..'

2125
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
'..when fate made him
see him on the way itself.'

2126
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:29,458
Quickly, quickly.

2127
01:56:29,625 --> 01:56:31,625
Turn around. Follow them.

2128
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:39,583
Stop here.

2129
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:43,166
Thank you very much, brother.

2130
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:45,083
Thank you. Bye.

2131
01:56:51,375 --> 01:56:52,625
Brother is here.

2132
01:57:00,083 --> 01:57:02,583
- Come on, hurry up.
- Okay.

2133
01:57:02,708 --> 01:57:03,750
We don't have much time.

2134
01:57:03,916 --> 01:57:05,166
- Okay, brother.
- Hey!

2135
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:18,000
Shinda!

2136
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:21,250
What are you doing here, Shinda?

2137
01:57:21,458 --> 01:57:23,125
After getting you
out of the village..

2138
01:57:23,375 --> 01:57:25,791
..police learnt that we
helped you leave the village.

2139
01:57:27,833 --> 01:57:29,541
We got into trouble, brother.

2140
01:57:32,375 --> 01:57:33,750
That is indeed very bad.

2141
01:57:33,875 --> 01:57:36,916
That's why I thought there is
only one way to rectify my mistake.

2142
01:57:37,791 --> 01:57:39,833
I should take you back
to the police station.

2143
01:57:39,916 --> 01:57:41,041
Only then will we
get rid of this trouble.

2144
01:57:41,291 --> 01:57:42,458
Don't joke.

2145
01:57:42,583 --> 01:57:44,375
We have done so much for you,
brother.

2146
01:57:44,666 --> 01:57:46,250
Can't you do even this much for us?

2147
01:57:46,458 --> 01:57:47,875
We will get you out again.

2148
01:57:47,958 --> 01:57:49,958
Now we know how to that quite well.

2149
01:57:50,125 --> 01:57:51,708
You have lost your mind.

2150
01:57:52,375 --> 01:57:55,833
Son, give him a
few hundred thousands.

2151
01:57:56,041 --> 01:57:57,708
He'll get himself treated.

2152
01:57:57,833 --> 01:57:59,833
You had agreed to pay
us 50 million, brother.

2153
01:57:59,916 --> 01:58:03,125
Take whatever you
are getting and leave.

2154
01:58:05,458 --> 01:58:09,458
My mother used to say
that I am quite hot-tempered.

2155
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:11,250
So, I shouldn't fight.

2156
01:58:13,166 --> 01:58:14,875
That's why I am
being polite with you.

2157
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:17,041
Please come to the
police station with me.

2158
01:58:17,958 --> 01:58:21,458
Otherwise,
I'll have to go against my mother.

2159
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:26,541
Have you seen these men?

2160
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:29,958
Is that all of them?
Or do I have to thrash more?

2161
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:31,416
What are you waiting for now?

2162
01:58:31,541 --> 01:58:35,541
Go ahead and turn
him black and blue.

2163
01:58:50,583 --> 01:58:52,458
Never abuse a Jatt.

2164
01:58:53,458 --> 01:58:57,750
If you ever do,
never do it in front of the Jatt.

2165
01:58:57,875 --> 01:58:59,916
If you ever want to
do it in front of the Jatt

2166
01:59:01,083 --> 01:59:04,458
then check his mood first.

2167
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:08,458
Because Jatt likes to break
some bones when he is in a bad mood.

2168
02:00:22,875 --> 02:00:25,958
Look, with all intent and honesty..

2169
02:00:26,083 --> 02:00:28,875
..we arrested a very
dangerous criminal Sukhchan.

2170
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:29,916
Yes.

2171
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,458
But two people from your village..

2172
02:00:32,583 --> 02:00:35,541
..for their own personal greed helped
him escape from the police station.

2173
02:00:37,208 --> 02:00:39,125
One of them is Balli,
who got arrested.

2174
02:00:39,208 --> 02:00:41,708
- The other one is..
- SHO sir!

2175
02:00:46,666 --> 02:00:48,708
Shinda with Sukhchan?

2176
02:00:51,208 --> 02:00:52,583
He caught him.

2177
02:00:55,958 --> 02:00:57,875
Your culprit, SHO sir.

2178
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:01,083
Arrest him!

2179
02:01:09,166 --> 02:01:11,208
We made a very big mistake, sir.

2180
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:14,916
But what can we say,
we were helpless.

2181
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:24,208
All this happened because of me.

2182
02:01:25,916 --> 02:01:29,916
Instead, Balli told
me where Sukhchan is hiding.

2183
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:32,500
He is innocent.

2184
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:38,875
He actually deserves a reward.

2185
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:42,125
His daughter is unwell.

2186
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:45,000
Please let him go.

2187
02:01:46,458 --> 02:01:47,791
Baint, take his statement.

2188
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:49,208
- Okay, sir.
- Release the other guy.

2189
02:01:49,416 --> 02:01:50,125
Okay.

2190
02:02:39,708 --> 02:02:42,041
'Shinda was sentenced
three months of imprisonment..'

2191
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:44,416
'..for giving refuge to Sukhchan.'

2192
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:47,791
'And Balli was let go scot-free.'

2193
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:52,541
'Sukhchan was sentenced
seven years imprisonment..'

2194
02:02:53,416 --> 02:02:55,625
'..for selling government land.'

2195
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:58,875
'The headman and the
lank clerk who helped him..'

2196
02:02:58,916 --> 02:03:00,916
'..were sentenced three
years imprisonment.'

2197
02:03:39,041 --> 02:03:41,125
You know that criminal
Sukhchan has escaped.

2198
02:03:41,458 --> 02:03:43,250
Oh. Yes, yes.

2199
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:45,666
He is inside, come in.

2200
02:04:19,458 --> 02:04:26,083
If I were Sukhchan,
I would hide here.

2201
02:04:33,833 --> 02:04:34,875
What will you get, sir?

2202
02:04:41,458 --> 02:04:42,541
A promotion?

2203
02:04:46,625 --> 02:04:50,208
Sukhchan is giving us 50 million
to get him out of this village.

2204
02:04:51,583 --> 02:04:55,958
If we join hands, we can
get our hands on the 500 million.

2205
02:04:56,666 --> 02:04:58,083
250 each.

2206
02:05:00,541 --> 02:05:03,041
No matter how many
promotions you get..

2207
02:05:04,041 --> 02:05:06,000
..you will never be able
to make this kind of money.

2208
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:08,000
Oh really?

2209
02:05:10,083 --> 02:05:12,458
You have a lot of courage.

2210
02:05:13,666 --> 02:05:16,541
Do you think you can
get to his 500 million?

2211
02:05:17,041 --> 02:05:19,125
It might sound too far reached..

2212
02:05:20,833 --> 02:05:25,958
..but I only say what I can do.

2213
02:05:29,208 --> 02:05:31,208
Sir, no one is here.

2214
02:05:33,833 --> 02:05:35,250
No one is here either.

2215
02:05:39,458 --> 02:05:41,250
Shall we get in the cars, sir?

2216
02:05:51,375 --> 02:05:53,916
'And Balli was let The
records of all chemists..

2217
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,750
..of this agree
don't just go to me..

2218
02:05:55,875 --> 02:05:57,500
SSP gets a copy as well.

2219
02:05:57,583 --> 02:06:00,208
Now have to come up
with a plan about how..

2220
02:06:00,291 --> 02:06:02,083
..you will get the
pump and from where.

2221
02:06:02,166 --> 02:06:03,041
Okay?

2222
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:05,833
- On Dushera..
- Yes?

2223
02:06:05,916 --> 02:06:08,125
You can do whatever you
want in the name of security.

2224
02:06:08,875 --> 02:06:10,250
But stay away from the Ramleela.

2225
02:06:12,291 --> 02:06:15,083
Get out of the village
as soon as you can.

2226
02:06:15,166 --> 02:06:17,625
Ramleel's head told us everything.

2227
02:06:19,125 --> 02:06:23,416
Balli got the 1 million as promised.
Now tell me where our money is.

2228
02:06:23,541 --> 02:06:25,583
There is a Fortuner
parked in my house.

2229
02:06:27,125 --> 02:06:29,791
There is 20 million
on its back seat.

2230
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:32,416
Thank you.

2231
02:06:32,791 --> 02:06:34,000
Thank you very much.

2232
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:35,291
I am greatful.

2233
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:36,875
SHO sir?

2234
02:06:39,291 --> 02:06:40,875
Before we divide the money..

2235
02:06:40,958 --> 02:06:43,416
..we need to give 3.7
million to the Ramleela actors.

2236
02:06:45,458 --> 02:06:48,083
You could manage to get only
20 million from the 500 million.

2237
02:06:48,166 --> 02:06:50,125
And you want me
to share that as well?

2238
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:52,833
I couldn't hide more
than 20 million in the car.

2239
02:06:52,916 --> 02:06:54,166
I thought I'll come
later and take it.

2240
02:06:54,291 --> 02:06:56,333
I didn't know that the
godown would catch fire.

2241
02:06:58,791 --> 02:07:01,833
Now let's share and
make do with what we got.

2242
02:07:06,708 --> 02:07:09,166
Have you ever wailed in self-pity?

2243
02:07:10,125 --> 02:07:11,208
What?

2244
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:12,833
I have.

2245
02:07:14,083 --> 02:07:16,541
I still do, sometimes.

2246
02:07:17,416 --> 02:07:19,625
- What do you mean?
- I got you 1 million.

2247
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:21,000
What more do you want?

2248
02:07:21,375 --> 02:07:23,916
Forget about the 3.7 million
for those Ramleela actors.

2249
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,041
That's settled.
They won't cause trouble.

2250
02:07:27,625 --> 02:07:28,625
Okay?

2251
02:07:32,666 --> 02:07:37,666
Oh yes, don't be disheartened
thinking that you lost 100 million.

2252
02:07:37,875 --> 02:07:41,875
Look at me, I lost 230 millions.

2253
02:07:43,875 --> 02:07:45,000
Fate.

2254
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:55,625
A very bad fate..

2255
02:08:01,041 --> 02:08:02,333
SHO has.

2256
02:08:11,208 --> 02:08:14,791
'Shinda new that SHO would
cheat him with the money.'

2257
02:08:15,083 --> 02:08:17,625
'That's why he had already
made the arrangement for that.'

2258
02:08:18,666 --> 02:08:19,666
CBI.

2259
02:09:15,875 --> 02:09:18,000
Lali's father wouldn't budge.

2260
02:09:18,416 --> 02:09:20,250
But I met him and
told him everything.

2261
02:09:20,375 --> 02:09:21,541
As to why you did all this.

2262
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:25,041
And the way you mended our mistake..

2263
02:09:25,125 --> 02:09:27,125
..by getting Sukhchan
arrested worked in your favour.

2264
02:09:56,625 --> 02:09:59,083
- I love you like crazy.
- I know.

2265
02:09:59,166 --> 02:10:01,125
Tell me, when are you
going to meet my daddy?

2266
02:10:01,625 --> 02:10:02,666
For what?

2267
02:10:03,041 --> 02:10:04,541
To talk about our relationship.

2268
02:10:04,666 --> 02:10:05,666
Stop it!

2269
02:10:05,833 --> 02:10:06,916
What relationship?

2270
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,125
That time is long gone.

2271
02:10:09,416 --> 02:10:11,708
Now I will directly
come to marry you.

2272
02:10:11,833 --> 02:10:12,958
But when?

2273
02:10:13,166 --> 02:10:14,958
I just need to do one last thing.

2274
02:10:15,041 --> 02:10:16,166
As soon as I finish that.

2275
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:18,500
Now your Shinda isn't
the same person he used to be.

2276
02:10:18,583 --> 02:10:20,041
I am different now.

2277
02:10:20,208 --> 02:10:22,041
You won't ever stop bluffing,
will you?

2278
02:10:22,458 --> 02:10:23,500
Balli!

2279
02:10:23,625 --> 02:10:25,083
She says we are bluffers.

2280
02:10:25,541 --> 02:10:26,750
Thank you, sister-in-law.

2281
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,708
So, did it work out?

2282
02:10:29,875 --> 02:10:31,375
Of course, it had to.

2283
02:10:31,708 --> 02:10:33,750
Shinda, you don't believe it.

2284
02:10:33,875 --> 02:10:36,916
This 1 milion reward
money has changed our lives.

2285
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,500
Simran got treated.

2286
02:10:38,625 --> 02:10:39,708
We bought a shop.

2287
02:10:39,875 --> 02:10:42,458
Moreover,
the bank which we wanted to rob..

2288
02:10:42,541 --> 02:10:45,541
..at the moment we have
the maximum deposit in it.

2289
02:10:45,666 --> 02:10:46,875
We will never be
able to spend it all.

2290
02:10:47,458 --> 02:10:50,000
Poor man, you will never think big.

2291
02:10:50,291 --> 02:10:51,875
That's why God never
gives you a lot.

2292
02:10:51,958 --> 02:10:55,791
Come on, be grateful that
Sukhchan didn't give us 50 million.

2293
02:10:55,875 --> 02:10:58,791
If he had, I would have
had a heart attack right away.

2294
02:10:58,875 --> 02:10:59,875
God saved me.

2295
02:10:59,958 --> 02:11:01,958
I wanted to tell
you something important.

2296
02:11:02,083 --> 02:11:04,875
Now I fear that you might
get an attack if I tell you.

2297
02:11:04,958 --> 02:11:06,583
No, tell me.
We have a lot of money now.

2298
02:11:06,708 --> 02:11:08,625
I can always get a stunt planted.

2299
02:11:09,125 --> 02:11:10,750
Okay then, listen carefully.

2300
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,958
Shinda, I have 500 million.

2301
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:51,000
Let me go and we will
spilt it between us.

2302
02:11:52,916 --> 02:11:54,875
You refused to give me 50 million.

2303
02:11:55,375 --> 02:11:56,916
So why would you give me 250?

2304
02:12:28,625 --> 02:12:30,000
All of them have money in them?

2305
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:31,416
Yes.

2306
02:12:31,916 --> 02:12:32,833
How much?

2307
02:12:35,666 --> 02:12:36,958
480 million.

2308
02:12:45,125 --> 02:12:49,166
Shinda, the day my daughter
was born I knew it right away..

2309
02:12:50,375 --> 02:12:54,541
..that our bad days
won't last for long now.

2310
02:12:58,791 --> 02:12:59,875
We..

2311
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,666
We won't be able to take
so much money in a motorcycle.

2312
02:13:05,833 --> 02:13:07,250
We cannot in a motorcycle.

2313
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:09,291
But I know in what we can.

2314
02:13:13,666 --> 02:13:18,541
In village, police baton-charged
at the teachers' rally.

2315
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,375
You two keep wasting
time in the cart.

2316
02:13:22,458 --> 02:13:24,083
Do you know what frauds
people have been doing?

2317
02:13:24,166 --> 02:13:25,125
What happened?

2318
02:13:25,208 --> 02:13:29,541
Some Purshotam scammed government
of 1000 million rupees and ran away.

2319
02:13:29,666 --> 02:13:30,833
Yes.

2320
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:36,041
You cannot be big by doing scams.

2321
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:38,041
You need to work hard for it.

2322
02:13:38,125 --> 02:13:39,791
You need to drive carts.

2323
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:41,500
Right, Balli?

2324
02:13:41,625 --> 02:13:42,500
Yes.

2325
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:44,541
Go, go, go.

2326
02:13:45,625 --> 02:13:48,166
Balli, find out
who this Purshotam is.

2327
02:14:10,166 --> 02:14:13,083
"Your beauty has become
the talk of the town."

2328
02:14:13,166 --> 02:14:16,041
"The money you spend
makes me frown."

2329
02:14:20,875 --> 02:14:23,833
"Your beauty has become
the talk of the town."

2330
02:14:23,875 --> 02:14:26,458
"The money you spend
makes me frown."

2331
02:14:26,583 --> 02:14:29,000
"You end up killing me.."

2332
02:14:29,083 --> 02:14:31,458
"..when you get on
the roof to see me."

2333
02:14:31,583 --> 02:14:35,125
"Your gait is a killer too."

2334
02:14:36,791 --> 02:14:39,708
"You keep embroidering
your dresses.."

2335
02:14:39,791 --> 02:14:42,458
"Why don't you
embellish my dress too?"

2336
02:14:42,583 --> 02:14:45,125
"You keep embroidering
your dresses.."

2337
02:14:45,208 --> 02:14:47,791
"Why don't you
embellish my dress too?"

2338
02:15:03,583 --> 02:15:06,708
"You are beautiful like the Heer.."

2339
02:15:06,833 --> 02:15:09,458
"I am crazy about thee."

2340
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:16,791
"Make me your beloved."

2341
02:15:17,208 --> 02:15:19,458
"Your brothers too
will accept me as a buddy."

2342
02:15:19,583 --> 02:15:22,208
"Make me your beloved."

2343
02:15:22,291 --> 02:15:24,750
"Your brothers too
will accept me as a buddy."

2344
02:15:24,875 --> 02:15:28,583
"Form a relationship with me."

2345
02:15:30,166 --> 02:15:32,708
"You keep embroidering
your dresses.."

2346
02:15:33,125 --> 02:15:35,666
"Why don't you
embellish my dress too?"

2347
02:15:35,875 --> 02:15:38,416
"You keep embroidering
your dresses.."

2348
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:41,250
"Why don't you
embellish my dress too?"
