1
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,010
Ma, I'm going for a run.

2
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,730
Will you pick up
some bread on the way back?

3
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,041
Why just bread?

4
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,926
Eggs, milk, the
paper, I'll get them all!

5
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,528
Oh ho just a minute listen up..

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,441
Amaya..

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,646
Amaya?

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,530
Oh..this girl just never listens!

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,122
Remember this?

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,486
Hmmm..

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,169
I'm good..

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,201
Mr. Sinha, but the models are better.

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,368
Hmmm, that I agree!

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,926
Spectacular!

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,564
Spectacular my foot.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,608
I'm looking like a Bijouka

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,162
Bijouka?

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,721
What's that?

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,882
Those things that stand in the fields..

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,291
Scarecrows!

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,090
But I like things
that stand in the fields..

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,607
Bijoukas!

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,804
Speaking of scarecrows,

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,724
I need to lose some weight.

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,121
WOW!

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,730
What a slick change of topic!

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,644
Hi Mrs. K! How are you?

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,847
Hey Mrs. K!

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,331
Wasssssup?

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Young man, surely you mean

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,922
what is up?

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,320
And it's not Mrs. K,

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,481
it's Leela aunty.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,006
Yeah yeah, we love you too Mrs. K!

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,841
Right, let me go
hang out with these monkeys!

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,971
I'll speak with her today.

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,643
Relax, there is no tearing hurry.

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,121
Wass..

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,364
What is up, uncle J!

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,764
Okay, so tell me..

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,805
Why do you bob your
heads like this while speaking?

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,483
We're in the groove uncle!

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,045
Oh! Groove..

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,331
"I wish for a tune, that I might play,"

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,207
"Which may bare my heart, I so pray."

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,524
"Lost in her tresses
as I watch her fly by,"

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,843
"Watching her over cups
of coffee, abysmally shy.."

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,527
"Who is she, do tell all"

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,920
"Facts on the table,
or we won't play ball.."

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,329
"It's a very simple formula,"

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,361
"Let your hearts speak and say Hurrah!"

52
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,851
"Hey Hey Hey"

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,410
"Mrs. K,"

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,450
"There's some
magic in your coffee today"

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,045
"Hey Hey Hey"

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,565
"Mrs. K,"

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,723
"There's some
magic in your coffee today"

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,724
"Know this that the heart is smitten,"

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,849
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,810
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

61
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,601
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,767
"Cherish these
moments, of love unspoken"

63
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,161
"Fill each second
with colours unbroken.."

64
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,564
"It's a very simple formula,"

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,962
"Live your life
carefree and without brouhaha!"

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,370
"Hey Hey Hey-T

67
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,851
"Mrs. K,"

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,685
"There's some
magic in your coffee today"

69
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,450
"Hey Hey Hey-T

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,851
"Mrs. K,"

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,010
"There's some
magic in your coffee today"

72
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,209
"Life's many colours,
inexplicable but inviting"

73
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,284
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

74
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,250
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

75
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,120
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,731
"Life is short and
shaded with many hues,"

77
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,924
"Live it like, you
have nothing to lose.."

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,004
"Where it may take you,"

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,847
"on it's journey so far,"

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,245
"Hey Hey Hey-T

81
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,731
"Mrs. K,"

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,849
"There's some magic
in your coffee today.."

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,365
"Hey Hey Hey-T

84
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,930
"Mrs. K,"

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,970
"There's some magic
in your coffee today.."

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,930
"Know this that the heart is smitten,"

87
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,090
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

88
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,323
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,121
"Coffee in this cafe is
but an excuse for flirting.."

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,766
Asshole.

91
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,080
Actually I'm the one at fault.

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,885
I should have
recognized the sort of man you are.

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,930
Don't bother, I QUIT!

94
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,727
Hi Amaya.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,887
How was your day?

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,842
Don't ask.

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,761
Okay

98
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,081
No Ma, ask me..ask me!

99
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,322
Hi Amaya, how was your day?

100
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,129
Men are such bastards.

101
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,009
They only have one thing on their minds!

102
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,967
Sex.

103
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,927
Yeah.

104
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,526
N--

105
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,450
slapped my boss today.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,641
Well..now my ex-boss.

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,087
Good!

108
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,444
We'll just re-register
on jobsearch.com yet again.

109
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,766
No problem.

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,161
So tell me.

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,446
What did he do?

112
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,801
Well,

113
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,849
actually he didn't do anything,

114
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,165
but he told me to sleep with him.

115
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,328
You didn't over-react did you?

116
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,011
Ma?!!?

117
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,010
So then what are you stressed about?

118
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,609
What you did was absolutely right.

119
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,370
Spoilt..

120
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,607
Mum, have you ever slapped anyone?

121
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,208
I mean other than me?

122
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,127
No.

123
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,687
Why?

124
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,000
You never felt like slapping anyone?

125
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,571
I did feel like it sometimes,

126
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,846
at your father.

127
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,201
What are you saying?

128
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,846
The two of you fought as well?

129
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,566
I don't remember that.

130
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,130
Actually, he was too nice for that,

131
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,130
which is why I felt like it!

132
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,485
Oh..

133
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,731
Is that why you
transferred all you angst to me?!

134
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,169
I'm really impulsive aren't I mum?

135
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,682
You remember what dad used to say?

136
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,524
Live by what you believe in,

137
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,445
even if it kills you.

138
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,050
The Busy Bazaar..

139
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,369
Which is the fool who says,

140
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,887
time stops for no one?

141
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,811
Look at this clock.

142
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,124
It's forever starting and stopping!

143
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,687
Every clock here is
like a traveler of sorts.

144
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,608
They stop when they
want to and go when they wish.

145
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,770
It's amazing Rizwaan bhai,

146
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,365
It seems like you've given
life to these inanimate clocks.

147
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,121
Sir,

148
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,807
what did you think?

149
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,329
That these clocks are lifeless?

150
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,082
These clocks are the ones that tell us,

151
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,083
when we entered this world

152
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,721
and when we left it's cloying confines.

153
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,329
Here please have some tea.

154
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,806
Thank you.

155
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,930
Very nice!

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,450
Tell me something?

157
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,364
Sitting in the midst of
all these different clocks,

158
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,568
how do you tell what is the right time?

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,286
Sir..

160
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,444
Who's to say what is
right and what is wrong?

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,765
That one moment,

162
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,010
spells celebration for someone

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,923
and mourning for someone else.

164
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,850
I actually want to ask you something.

165
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,362
Why do you take so many pictures?

166
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,329
Well, like you I also play with time.

167
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,130
I try to capture

168
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,611
every memorable moment as an image.

169
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,887
And why's that?

170
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,691
So that instead of
it being only a moment,

171
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,922
it remains preserved as
a beautiful memory instead.

172
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,282
Sir..

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,721
Memories must always
be preserved in the mind!

174
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,570
You can never trust
the mind either can you?

175
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,249
It's getting late, I must leave now..

176
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,167
But how will I find your shop again?

177
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,490
There is Abdul's
tea stall on the corner...?

178
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,243
Yes, I've seen it.

179
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,129
We're just off to it's right.

180
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,765
That's easy enough!

181
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,125
Whenever the pictures do get printed,

182
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,964
do show them to me as well.

183
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,042
Absolutely, that remains a promise.

184
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,685
So how hard did you actually slap him?

185
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,367
Care for a taster?!

186
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,567
AMAYA..

187
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,449
Relax Ma! I'm only joking!

188
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,926
So our resident Joan
of Arc is now unemployed?

189
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,446
Not unemployed Jazz!

190
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,011
I'm just taking time off,

191
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,047
there's a difference.

192
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,004
Well, from where I'm sitting,
your time off itself looks like,

193
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,882
you are now fully
and completely unemployed!

194
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,328
Hmm..

195
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,007
That's because
you've gone completely kooky!

196
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,445
Tell me something?

197
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,809
Instead of dancing
on my head all the time,

198
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,325
why don't the both of
you find something else to do?

199
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,926
Ms Chamko does have a point there.

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,882
Patience I say!

201
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,606
Creativity does take some time!

202
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,205
You know Jazz,

203
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,686
when I was working

204
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,603
I always said, when I had time,

205
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,523
I'd do this and I'd do that.

206
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,523
Would you care to elaborate

207
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,364
on all of your this's and that's?

208
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,091
I want to learn pottery

209
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,247
Ok

210
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,560
I want to run a marathon

211
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,283
And maybe someday,

212
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,608
I want to write my own book

213
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,890
The first two you
may still be able to do.

214
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,042
But the third you
may as well forget about!

215
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,801
I've been wanting to write a book,

216
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,245
since before I knew how to write!

217
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,245
So why haven't you done it yet?

218
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,970
Because I still don't know how to write!

219
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,366
Deal!

220
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,407
I'll do the writing
while you take the pictures..

221
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,042
It'll be a really
cool coffee table book.

222
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,805
It's not a very bad idea!

223
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,524
Now that's all that was left to do!

224
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,685
My coffee.

225
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,961
My table.

226
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,571
And your coffee table book?

227
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,448
It'll lie here forgotten
on these very book shelves.

228
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,045
How mean mama!

229
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,326
Spoilsport.

230
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,210
A veritable fountain of encouragement!

231
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,209
Hi! Sorry, sorry!!

232
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,329
How do you manage
to be late, all the time?

233
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,806
Dude..

234
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,884
There's still ten
minutes till the movie begins..

235
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,007
Let it be.

236
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,801
Ok guys.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,001
Guess what?

238
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,722
Announcement.

239
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,282
I'm writing a book with Jazz!

240
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,164
Good job!

241
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,845
Who's Jazz?

242
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,921
Jayant..you've met him
at the cafe the other day.

243
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,850
Oh! that Jazz..

244
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,167
Yes..that Jazz!

245
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,528
He likes aunty doesn't he?

246
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,726
Are you mad?

247
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,800
Since it's your first time,

248
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,160
This is on the house.

249
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,447
Thank you,

250
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,000
Indian hospitality
really knows no bounds!

251
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,809
This is not hospitality.

252
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,405
This is good business sense,

253
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,802
now you'll definitely come back!

254
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,646
I'm about to set up camp here.

255
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,722
Oh good.

256
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,681
Would you actually have a
vacancy for a waiter or the like?

257
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,604
My wife might be a
little over qualified but..

258
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,250
Don't mind my husband.

259
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,330
Abhay is an ass.

260
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,447
Oops.

261
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,167
I never judge a book by it's cover.

262
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,968
Thank you!

263
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,691
But really! You're living my dream.

264
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,764
In fact we only came in because

265
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,047
we were so intrigued
by the name of your cafe!

266
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,246
<i>You know, me cam may be mine,</i>

267
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,287
but it was christened by my daughter!

268
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,089
Very interesting.

269
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,087
And you've really travelled the world.

270
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,847
Actually, not really.

271
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,684
These are all pictures of
people who came here as strangers,

272
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,762
But left as lifelong friends.

273
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,247
Let me show you.

274
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,800
This is Cindy, she's from Peru.

275
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,690
Leave alone Hindi, she
could barely speak English!

276
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,645
But you know, she's
told me so much about Peru,

277
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,371
that it feels like I
know the country inside out.

278
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,800
It's amazing!

279
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,160
That's great!

280
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,131
It sounds like you
get to travel the world,

281
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,448
without having to leave the cafe at all!

282
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,364
Actually that is true!

283
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,241
There's something
special about this little cafe".

284
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,527
Is this your daughter?

285
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,602
Yes

286
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,442
How do you know?

287
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,369
She has your eyes..

288
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,965
What does she do?

289
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,241
She does a lot of things!

290
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,881
She's a full time writer,

291
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,044
Part time cafe manager,

292
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,167
But..

293
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,924
At heart, Amaya is a..

294
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,760
Free spirit!

295
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,163
"The mind knows no boundaries"

296
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,322
"Dreams have no walls"

297
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,164
"They walk hand in hand"

298
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,210
"As you follow where life calls.."

299
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,969
"The mind knows no boundaries"

300
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,088
"Dreams have no walls"

301
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,889
"They walk hand in hand"

302
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,566
"As you follow where life calls.."

303
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,445
You can read later,

304
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,204
let's concentrate on
writing our book first.

305
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,801
Jazz..

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,762
This is a story of a weasel.

307
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,285
Don't waste time on
stupid books! Lets go.

308
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,088
We must buy this one!

309
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,491
I said, get up!

310
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,802
Jazz!

311
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,961
It's a great title for our book.

312
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,246
Weasel on a hot tin roof!

313
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,644
This seems to be older than me also!

314
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,165
Will this camera work?

315
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,731
It might, or it might not!

316
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,566
"Open skies above me"

317
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,042
"Not a corner to be seen

318
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,160
"A gentle breeze flows past free"

319
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,002
"Directionless but so happily keen"

320
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,283
"if I could only fly"

321
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,842
"Like those birds soaring high"

322
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,049
"Knowing them as I sail by"

323
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,284
"Speaking their
language, not being shy

324
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,691
"Those many sun kissed lanes"

325
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,047
"From where the breeze whispers out"

326
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,009
"Dancing lightly as sprinkling rain"

327
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,084
"Kissing lips that curl in a pout"

328
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,969
"The mind knows no boundaries"

329
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,963
"Dreams have no walls"

330
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,849
"They walk hand in hand"

331
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,526
"As you follow where life calls.."

332
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,401
Hi Leela!

333
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,487
Hi Jayant.

334
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,847
We're on our way to the famous
stuffed flat bread lane in Chandni Chowk.

335
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,445
To eat there?

336
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,402
No..

337
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,006
To buy chickens and sell eggs instead!

338
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,321
And before you ask,

339
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,970
Your daughter is safe and well.

340
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,122
You have
absolutely no cause for concern.

341
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,128
You know, when I was a child,

342
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,690
we used to come here very often.

343
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,643
This was dad's favorite Sunday outing.

344
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,405
In fact, I even started to write here.

345
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,771
The Busy Bazaar.

346
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,126
My first story,

347
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,442
I was nine years old.

348
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,207
Dad read the story,

349
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,691
and asked me to change the way it ended.

350
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,886
But I didn't change it,

351
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,883
Because I believed in my story.

352
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,491
You know, that day

353
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,367
my father became my biggest fan.

354
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,282
He used to say,

355
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,442
the day your first book gets published,

356
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,727
we'll celebrate it with Champagne.

357
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,969
I guess he just ran out of time.

358
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,884
Come, I want you to
meet a very interesting man.

359
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,687
He repairs old clocks,

360
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,683
his shop is somewhere close by.

361
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,128
"Hold on to these memories"

362
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,121
"Fragrant, fresh moments all"

363
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,081
"May they never
fade like a dying breeze"

364
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,842
"These precious moments of recall"

365
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,368
"Lock up these special moments"

366
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,206
"Deep inside our heart"

367
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,084
"Telling others our stories"

368
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,245
"When they come out of the dark"

369
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,725
"The hope of every morning"

370
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,246
"As windows open to the suns rays"

371
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,651
"Like gentle dew drops forming"

372
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,361
"That today shall be a wondrous day"

373
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,969
"The mind knows no boundaries"

374
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,042
"Dreams have no walls"

375
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,009
"They walk hand in hand"

376
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,129
"As you follow where life calls.."

377
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,928
Lets go Aditi,
we'll come some other time.

378
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,362
'Memories must be
preserved in the mind!'

379
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,286
'That one moment,
spells celebration for someone'

380
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,010
'and mourning for someone else.'

381
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,967
'There is Abdul's
tea stall on the corner...?'

382
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,283
Happy birthday Ma!!

383
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,087
Oh! My God!

384
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,450
Thank you.

385
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,930
Thanks.

386
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,731
Open it.

387
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,929
Oh, this is nice..

388
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,161
You like it?

389
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,210
Can I borrow it?

390
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,851
Yes..

391
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,726
So, what did you'll do yesterday?

392
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,524
I completely filled my dictaphone,

393
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,967
while Jazz filled all 4 of
his memory cards with pictures

394
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,011
You know Ma, Jazz
is actually pretty cool.

395
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,008
He makes friends so easily!

396
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,163
In a place like Chandni Chowk,

397
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,925
he knew every lane
and every shop in it..

398
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,328
Except for this one
shop, he couldn't find.

399
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,365
Speak of the Devil! - Hello?

400
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,124
So what is it that
I'm supposed to say today?

401
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,486
Happy Birthday!

402
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,841
Thank you.

403
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,488
You're being
praised to the high heavens.

404
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,166
Please tell her that I
also had a very good time.

405
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,766
Why don't you tell her
yourself when you get here?

406
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,730
Qkay..bye.

407
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,610
Ma, how old was Aditi?

408
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,405
Eight or nine. Why do you ask?

409
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,051
Jazz suddenly called me Aditi yesterday.

410
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,770
Aunty, please hand me the knife.

411
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,490
Hand it over right now.

412
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,406
What do you want to do with it?

413
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,723
I want to commit suicide.

414
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,326
Oh! One second..

415
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,606
Use this one, this
will work much better.

416
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,286
Aunty? You're finding this funny?

417
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,167
I mean look at me.

418
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,720
I'm good looking,
handsome, tall, Intelligent.

419
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,325
With an IQ of over 220

420
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,482
I even have a six pack..

421
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,561
Care to see?

422
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,530
And above all aunty,

423
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,931
I'm so modest too.

424
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,967
I love your daughter so much.

425
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,563
And she, doesn't
give me the time of day.

426
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,006
Hmm..

427
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,721
Hmm?

428
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,126
Hmmm?

429
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,084
All I get is a hmm?

430
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,121
Aunty don't just say hmm..

431
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,804
Please do something.

432
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,208
Oh God, he's here again..

433
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,926
Hi Amaya!

434
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,281
Bye Raghav!

435
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,007
Good morning Guruji.

436
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,923
Bless you my child, bless you!

437
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,162
Mum, I'll be back in awhile

438
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,890
can you please not
entertain this Orangutan..

439
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,242
Come on..lets go, lets go.

440
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,687
Aunty,

441
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,610
I really love Amaya.

442
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,727
<i>Raghav ,</i>

443
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,484
I really love Amaya too.

444
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,443
Jayant uncle, bless me please.

445
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,885
Whatever dude.

446
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,446
He's a really nice boy

447
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,760
and you know, he's crazy about Amaya.

448
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,320
But that is
historically true of this place.

449
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,246
Whoever comes here,

450
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,448
either falls for the daughter

451
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,364
or the mother instead!

452
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,165
What was this boy's name?

453
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,161
Raghav

454
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,882
That's right,

455
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,601
Raghav..

456
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,041
Correct.

457
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,926
Okay.

458
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,401
Show me.

459
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,371
I'll show you a fantastic picture.

460
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,880
Actually"

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,286
You know Jayant,

462
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,045
I'm so glad Amaya's really fond of you.

463
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,765
It won't be easy though.

464
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,411
I know,

465
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,040
but I know Amaya too.

466
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,801
She'll handle it.

467
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,849
Ma..should I wear
this sari to Priya's wedding?

468
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,680
Priya? Finally?

469
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,560
But doesn't Nishant
look a lot older than her?

470
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,522
Err yeah.

471
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,602
Because Priya is only
20 years younger to him!

472
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,251
What do you expect?

473
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,288
But don't they look so good together?

474
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,361
No I need to give
you something brighter.

475
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,248
Why?

476
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,526
It's a marriage not a funeral!

477
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,170
But I like black!

478
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,687
More books

479
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,921
for Book a Coffee!

480
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,851
Hi, I'm Devika

481
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,410
- Hi! -Abhay.

482
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,720
Hi, I'm Amaya

483
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,565
Yeah we know, the free spirit"?

484
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,051
Oh!

485
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,971
So, you've met my mother before?

486
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,445
- Here. - Thanks.

487
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,881
So tell me, how did you decide to return

488
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,564
from America after ten years?

489
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,482
Devika wanted to open a clinic here,

490
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,768
and after all, there's
nothing like being home, is there?

491
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,651
It's just a matter of
getting used to living here again.

492
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,287
Why? Aren't you enjoying living here?

493
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,125
No, it's not that.

494
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,886
Our friends had
warned us before we re-located

495
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,691
about the system here..

496
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,808
The famous Indian system

497
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,201
Look, I've made my peace with it,

498
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,965
If by greasing a few palms,

499
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,280
it makes life easier all around,

500
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,249
then do it. Everybody does it..

501
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,810
So basically, you've
taken the easy way out?

502
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,450
C'mon Amaya, he's got a point!

503
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,601
What point Ma?

504
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,444
Everyone makes this
point, it's very convenient.

505
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,409
Which is why nothing changes here.

506
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Amaya, it's not like
I'm supporting corruption.

507
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,609
Well!

508
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,523
Your logic is exactly like
you're supporting corruption!

509
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,967
Abhay, who have you tangled with?

510
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,927
You know Amaya and my husband..

511
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,887
What's this?

512
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,566
The party's already started

513
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,007
and I wasn't even informed!

514
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,086
Hi, Jayant Sinha.

515
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,367
Abhay..my wife Devika.

516
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,845
Happy Birthday to you,

517
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,127
we have a cake here for you.

518
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,804
Raghav, even you knew?

519
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,121
Happy Birthday aunty Leela.

520
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,689
Happy birthday to you.

521
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,807
Happy birthday!

522
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,927
Thank you!

523
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,080
Whenever you
manage to stand up straight,

524
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,400
I'd like to have a word with you.

525
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,005
Are you only planning to party,

526
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,082
or are there any ideas for the book too?

527
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,571
No actually, I've been unwell.

528
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,687
I've got Writer's block!

529
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,683
When people move as violently as you do,

530
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,330
things are bound to
go wrong all the time!

531
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,287
Ever since we spoke the other day,

532
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,403
I've come up with a fantastic idea.

533
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,767
What?

534
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,605
To really get to know someone well,

535
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,445
you must dig down and
peer into their memories.

536
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,648
So, why don't you
write a book about memories?

537
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,246
Something like..

538
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,049
We'll write it

539
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,207
“Memories of the Busy Bazaar“

540
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,167
ls your husband a writer too?

541
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,167
Hello?

542
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,280
Sorry, I think I've
dialed the wrong number.

543
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,003
Cafe's shut today?

544
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,526
What's happened?

545
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,601
Because we're going to lunch out.

546
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,526
Are we going to eat Biryani?

547
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,011
That I can do even at home!

548
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,482
You are going to make Biryani?

549
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,130
Then we're definitely
going to lunch out today.

550
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,044
C'mon Ma, I'm not that bad!

551
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,446
Quite bad..

552
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,442
Quite bad. Nonsense.

553
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,006
Dad used to always measure out spices

554
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,809
using his fingers.

555
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,844
You remember that?

556
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,241
And I also remember

557
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,482
that he made
better Biryani than you too!

558
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,166
Rubbish.

559
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,403
Dad was such a great guy.

560
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,166
I think, they just
don't make men like him anymore.

561
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,001
Now don't get all sentimental on me!

562
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,444
I'm the one getting sentimental?

563
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,171
Okay lets see..

564
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,366
IT'S BURNING!!!

565
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,327
WOW!

566
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,807
Come and sit.

567
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,764
I also want to speak with you..

568
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,961
Amaya just see..

569
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,006
It's Jazz.

570
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,681
So take the call.

571
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,365
You take the call yourself..

572
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,560
Hello?

573
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,848
Where are you?

574
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,569
Where do you think, but at home...?

575
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,244
Why are you sounding so angry?

576
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,810
I've lost my mobile phone.

577
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,767
Where?

578
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,247
Sorry, silly question.

579
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,481
What are you'll up to?

580
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,567
Eating lunch,

581
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,444
special Amaya biryani.

582
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,286
Does Amaya plan on only cooking biryani,

583
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,885
or does she plan on
starting to write as well?

584
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,088
Yeah, she's writing too"

585
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,561
Oh shucks..

586
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,449
Jayant I'll just call you back.

587
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,890
Ma, I can't get this right.

588
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,724
Oh! You look lovely!

589
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,965
Are you going out somewhere?

590
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,049
Jayant and I are going out to dinner.

591
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,086
Come..

592
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,485
We can give you a lift.

593
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,166
No need. I'm going with my friends.

594
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,326
Okay. Have fun.

595
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,091
Please congratulate Priya
and Nishant on my behalf as well.

596
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,207
Bye.

597
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,611
Bye..

598
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,925
Thank you.

599
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,445
I have only one major regret in my life,

600
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,166
I haven't travelled..

601
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,882
I met an Australian the other day..

602
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,446
She would be older than you also!

603
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,964
She'd bought a one
way ticket around the world.

604
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,482
And no plan, nothing.

605
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,604
She left when she wanted
to, and if she liked a place,

606
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,842
she just stayed as long as she desired!

607
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,410
The quintessential traveler!

608
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,126
I envied her..

609
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,522
I so envied her.

610
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,601
We'll travel the world together Leela,

611
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,730
the whole world.

612
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,125
You and me together.

613
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,765
Even Madhavi and Aditi loved to travel.

614
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,929
It was Aditi's spring break,

615
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,685
so we left for
Ranikhet, early in the morning.

616
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,603
There used to be a
small restaurant on the way,

617
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,648
where Madhavi loved to stop for tea.

618
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,610
So we stopped"

619
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,926
Aditi was asleep on the seat behind,

620
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,410
so I opened the door

621
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,450
and picked her up in my arms.

622
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,960
Madhavi said, lets
leave after a cup of tea.

623
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,089
Since Aditi woke up hungry,

624
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,245
I asked them

625
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,764
to fetch sandwiches lying in the car.

626
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,327
I was loading a new
roll of film in the camera.

627
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,884
It suddenly started
to pour down with rain,

628
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,601
so, I asked them to stay in the car,

629
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,205
while I paid up.

630
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,610
As I turned to leave after paying,

631
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,049
I saw a truck speeding towards our car.

632
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,570
Before I could say or do anything"

633
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,361
It crashed straight into our car.

634
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,089
My Aditi and Madhavi

635
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,011
died on the spot.

636
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,368
My daughter was only 9 years old Leela.

637
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,171
She was so small..

638
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,763
For years thereafter, I cursed myself.

639
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,846
Why was I not in the car with them"

640
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,401
Ma..

641
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,921
Ma?

642
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,366
Ma..

643
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,201
Ma...?

644
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,281
I'm sorry.

645
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,926
Listen Amaya..

646
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,444
'I'm listening Ma'

647
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,250
'I'm listening Ma'

648
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,044
'I'm listening Ma'

649
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,965
I want to go to Bangalore.

650
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,650
I want to meet Aunty.

651
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,491
Amaya..can we talk?

652
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,325
I want to leave tomorrow.

653
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,011
Okay.

654
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,685
I'll call her.

655
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,801
Sujata?

656
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,326
Leela? What a lovely surprise!

657
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,961
Mummy was asking
about you all yesterday.

658
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,681
How are you'll doing?

659
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,129
Amaya wants to come to Bangalore.

660
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,247
Oh great!

661
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,685
Is she coming for an interview?

662
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,287
No. She wants to meet with you.

663
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,921
Really.

664
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,441
Everything okay?

665
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,966
I don't know..

666
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,048
I'll book her on an evening flight.

667
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,926
Well please tell Amaya,

668
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,809
I'm really looking
forward to seeing her.

669
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,847
I will.

670
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,887
Take care, bye.

671
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,884
Aunty will be at the
airport to pick you up.

672
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,882
I don't want to go.

673
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,207
But, didn't you just say..

674
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,645
I can change my mind Ma!

675
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,282
Your father was my best friend.

676
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,563
The day he died,

677
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,608
it almost felt like
I'd died with him too.

678
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,809
But then I saw you

679
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,531
and realized that life stops for no one.

680
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,201
You became my strength Amaya.

681
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,129
I really missed your father.

682
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,531
These twelve years have been tough,

683
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,124
and I had no one to
tell me right from wrong.

684
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,330
Bringing you up alone

685
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,042
was a challenge by itself,

686
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,003
but I've enjoyed every moment of it.

687
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,244
I'm proud of who you've grown up to be.

688
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,205
Dad would have been too"

689
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,321
Intelligent,

690
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,766
confident,

691
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,724
ambitious young woman.

692
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,521
An exciting world awaits you,

693
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,043
full of opportunities.

694
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,122
So a few years ago, I thought to myself

695
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,446
why not start living my life again?

696
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,802
I started Book a Coffee.

697
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,484
I met with some old friends,

698
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,081
and I made some new ones too.

699
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,889
Jayant and I just clicked.

700
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,450
We didn't know,

701
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,887
if we both wanted
the same things from life.

702
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,170
We'd often be afraid.

703
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,641
In fact,

704
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,802
the biggest fear was

705
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,367
whether you would
be fond of Jayant or not.

706
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,204
You put that fear to rest yourself.

707
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,011
And Amaya,

708
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,368
I'm sure you'll understand this,

709
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,964
Jayant made me feel like a woman again.

710
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,331
We want to spend the
rest of our lives together.

711
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,406
Amaya?

712
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,001
Good morning!

713
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,606
What do you think?

714
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,725
I don't like the title..

715
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,682
But why? I think it's very appropriate.

716
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,090
Because memories are very personal,

717
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,763
And we have no right to
dig up other peoples' memories.

718
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,603
Maybe we should
never have started this book.

719
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,889
It's not too late yet,

720
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,446
but I believe

721
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,281
if you start something,

722
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,723
it's only right to
see it through to its end.

723
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,121
Uncle, listen to this joke..

724
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,523
Santa whispers
something into Banta's ear.

725
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,531
Banta dies instantly.

726
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,046
What is it that Santa
whispered into Banta's ear?

727
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,971
Say say..

728
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,800
BANG!

729
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,367
It wasn't so bad was it?

730
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,281
Leela aunty, give this to me..

731
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,288
You go sit down.

732
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,931
No no..I'll earn some
tips in the meanwhile too!

733
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,125
When are you leaving for Ranikhet?

734
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,722
In a couple of days.

735
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,206
Bye Mrs. K

736
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,567
Bye Bye..

737
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,680
Tell me something,

738
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,004
what do you feel when you go back now?

739
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,322
It doesn't hurt so much now.

740
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,771
I stop for tea at the same restaurant,

741
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,362
the same owner still chats with me..

742
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,368
Cars come and go as usual..

743
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,244
It doesn't hurt so much now.

744
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,207
Yesterday.

745
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,961
When I spoke with Amaya yesterday,

746
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,089
she didn't react at all.

747
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,570
She didn't say a word.

748
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,005
She will.

749
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,450
You just need to give her some time.

750
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,887
WOW!

751
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,049
But what is this Busy Bazaar?

752
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,605
A little girl

753
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,169
who gets lost in a market

754
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,563
and goes looking for her father"

755
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,524
Amaya's first story,

756
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,006
and now, possibly her first book.

757
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,246
Oh Abhay!

758
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,681
Hi..

759
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,405
What a lovely surprise.

760
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,642
This is for you.

761
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,563
Oh, thank you!

762
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,687
Come..

763
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,127
Come in.

764
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,361
Thanks.

765
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,002
Hello!

766
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,081
Hi!

767
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,809
Not angry any more I hope!

768
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,370
I'm so sorry about that day!

769
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,202
Don't bother"

770
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,361
I'm an idiot.

771
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,169
It's okay..

772
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,841
So tell me,

773
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,490
how is Devika? Where is she?

774
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,689
She's just gone to
look at a few places to rent..

775
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,884
For the clinic, I told you about.

776
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,167
Right, you mentioned earlier.

777
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,810
It's a family day in?

778
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,166
Yeah..

779
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,444
Is Jayant not at home?

780
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,125
Jayant must be at home only..

781
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,640
Of course.

782
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,209
The weather's become really erratic"

783
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,966
Yeah.. but,

784
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,564
It's nice..l like it!

785
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,201
It rains every year at the same time?

786
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,926
Actually"

787
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,685
It rains whenever!

788
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,645
One never knows..

789
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,647
He asked me actually,

790
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,925
Jayant only told me to
come over in the evening.

791
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,051
So you left the
wine at Leela's home too?

792
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,600
You're something else..

793
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,281
Thanks

794
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,527
Why didn't you tell me?

795
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,568
Okay, I'm forgetful as a person,

796
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,290
I forgot to SMS you the address..

797
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,682
But my dear sir, you went ahead

798
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,524
and decided everything in your own mind!

799
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,367
All black and white?

800
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,205
They are life's two
basic shades after all,

801
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,327
black and white.

802
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,847
Extraordinary!

803
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,886
Actually quite ordinary.

804
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,883
A common man's everyday life..

805
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,482
Which we always tend to overlook.

806
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,367
There lies the
difference between you and us.

807
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,885
Oh boy!

808
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,684
Angry young woman.

809
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,443
Maybe just a
misunderstood young woman...?

810
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,131
And after all, anger is
also an important emotion,

811
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,160
it must also be present in one's life.

812
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,087
Shall we sit?

813
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,286
Sure.

814
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,367
Amaya?

815
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,086
Aren't you ready yet?

816
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,081
For what?

817
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,051
The sample of the new chairs is ready,

818
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,201
we have to approve it.

819
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,561
So?

820
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,330
Why do I need to come?

821
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,370
You go and see them yourself..

822
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,565
Go and see them myself?

823
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,010
I'm not deciding on this alone,

824
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,731
I need your opinion.

825
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,441
MY Opinion?

826
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,881
Really?

827
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,131
Lucky me!

828
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,928
Hi sorry..

829
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,967
What is it?

830
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,964
Just give me two minutes"

831
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,127
- Need any help? - No thanks.

832
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,326
Okay"

833
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,331
Thank you.

834
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,162
I'm so sorry!

835
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,162
That's alright.

836
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,489
I think I'll help anyway..

837
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,051
For the cups at least.

838
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,725
Chaos huh?

839
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,211
Where is Leela?

840
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,201
She's not feeling well.

841
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,806
What's happened to her?

842
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,885
I don't know.

843
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,280
<i>Amaya,.</i>

844
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,725
please give mummy this medicine

845
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,723
before she goes to bed.

846
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,242
What's happened to her?

847
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,169
Nothing serious,

848
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,522
just a little bit stressed I think.

849
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,480
- Okay bye! - Thank you.

850
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,406
Here, I'll pick up the medicines.

851
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,411
Look Raghav, I don't need..

852
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,050
You don't need my help?

853
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,611
I know.

854
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,011
Amaya, I'm not
doing this to impress you,

855
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,646
I actually happen to
be fond of Leela aunty.

856
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,246
This is for her.

857
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,209
So..if you don't mind,

858
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,487
Clean up.

859
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,686
Thanks.

860
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,684
I read your draft.

861
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,360
It's touching.

862
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,046
Nice.

863
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,202
Amaya?

864
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,611
Talk to me.

865
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,126
Good night Ma.

866
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,324
Please talk to me..

867
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,082
So, what'll you have?

868
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,127
I'll have one of these..

869
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,803
Okay..that one? And what'll you have?

870
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,962
I'll have a regular Mexican..

871
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,849
Okay. That's what you have every time!

872
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,600
Why did you get UP?

873
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,284
Aren't you supposed to go rest?

874
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,681
It's okay.

875
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,202
You have a publisher
meeting today don't you?

876
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,486
Go and meet him.

877
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,729
And please don't slap him or anything!

878
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,686
Okay"

879
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,566
Amaya..

880
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,962
Devika's invited us
over for dinner tonight.

881
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,085
Who is “us“?

882
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,446
You and me Amaya..

883
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,846
<i>I'll try.</i>

884
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,610
And I said to him..

885
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,886
Ouch!

886
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,528
Raghav, why do you
always insist on helping me?

887
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,721
I'm sorry..

888
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,049
"A little girl does a stranger meet"

889
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,288
"Light of step, she skips a beat"

890
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,486
"Within her heart is a to and fro"

891
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,164
"A little bit of come and go"

892
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,049
"Wide awake on a sleepy night"

893
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,284
"How strange was she you tell me!"

894
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,690
"A little girl does a stranger meet"

895
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,922

900
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,248
"Prancing, dancing and romancing"

901
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,961
"To herself she would happiness bring"

902
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,962
"Prancing, dancing and romancing"

903
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,203
"To herself she would happiness bring"

904
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,850
"And with the stranger whom she met"

905
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,649
"Into a trance she would get"

906
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,246
"Wide awake on a sleepy night"

907
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,324

"In the drizzle that now gently fell"

918
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,444
"Drops of rain clung to her"

919
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,161
"Crazy as only she could be"

920
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,490

"Sensuous yet sensuously demure"

924
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,771
"In the dark of night with the stranger"

925
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,606
"In full flow the lissome lass"

926
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,923
"How strange was she you tell me!"

927
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,249
"A little girl does a stranger meet"

928
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,288
"Light of step, she skips a beat"

929
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,521
"Within her heart is a to and fro"

930
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,170
"A little bit of come and go"

931
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,607
"Wide awake on a sleepy night"

932
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,405
"How strange was she you tell me!"

933
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,881
Hi!

934
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,087
Oh hi..

935
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,722
When did you get back?

936
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,768
Just now..how are you?

937
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,960
Upset.

938
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,250
I'll just be back, sit..

939
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,530
Ms Krishnamoorthy..

940
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,090
Congratulations,

941
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,409
on your first publication.

942
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,283
I can hardly believe,

943
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,886
Memories of the Busy Bazaar,

944
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,407
is the work of a first time author.

945
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,326
Brillirant!

946
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,886
Actually,

947
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,169
I was so looking forward

948
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,525
to meeting Mr. Sinha as well.

949
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,451
His photography is outstanding.

950
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,411
I think, he's not in town sir.

951
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,324
Sir, there's just one more thing"

952
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,765
I wanted to change
the title of the book.

953
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,806
Absolutely not!

954
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,207
The title will sell first,

955
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,284
people will love the book after that.

956
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,881
Okay.

957
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,207
Thank you Mr. Khanna.

958
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,281
Thank you very much.

959
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,850
Thank you so much!

960
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,210
I have been thinking Leela..

961
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,644
Why do I keep returning to Ranikhet?

962
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,490
Because somewhere in my subconscious,

963
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,370
I've hoarded my most precious memories.

964
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,851
Amaya is doing the same thing.

965
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,050
I'm afraid to even speak with her now,

966
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,606
I never know what
she will say and when..

967
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,920
Naturally, till now

968
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,482
she has never had
to take your permission,

969
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,689
to enter your room.

970
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,203
She could do so at any
time, without so much as knocking..

971
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,203
Now, she will need to knock,

972
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,925
ask if she can enter..

973
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,841
It's a small thing,

974
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,684
but it has a different meaning for her.

975
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,687
So, how's the book coming along?

976
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,722
Good!

977
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,241
- Here.. - Thanks.

978
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,651
Thank you..

979
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,768
Actually it's about to be published.

980
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,841
Hey!

981
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,445
Congratulations!

982
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,167
I wanted Ma to be
the first person to know..

983
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,883
But, you'll are..

984
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,730
So cheers I guess!

985
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,451
Cheers!

986
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,524
She is coming right?

987
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,886
Yeah of course..

988
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,769
Actually, let me check.

989
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,407
She must be on her way.

990
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,766
Yeah.

991
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,806
So, nice house!

992
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,606
Thank you!

993
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,964
We all live within our
individual comfort zones,

994
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,888
when they're disturbed, it bothers us.

995
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,526
But she's very comfortable with you.

996
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,761
Yes she is,

997
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,490
but only as a friend.

998
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,088
She's missing her father Leela,

999
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,691
and now her biggest fear,

1000
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,603
is that I may be
replacing him in her life.

1001
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,727
So..why don't you speak with her,

1002
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,730
if only as a friend?

1003
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,885
I don't believe
anyone can explain this to her,

1004
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,850
she needs to work it out for herself.

1005
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,726
She always picks up.

1006
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,010
I can't get through
on the home line either.

1007
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,723
I hope she's feeling well..

1008
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,887
Lets not waste anymore time,

1009
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,041
come..lets go.

1010
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,487
Hey"

1011
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,206
This is my colour,

1012
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,524
You're playing this.

1013
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,120
Red is my colour.

1014
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,281
Amaya?

1015
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,926
Abhay? I'm so sorry..

1016
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,889
I just forgot.

1017
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,007
Unbelievable!

1018
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,642
No no..it's okay.

1019
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,808
We'll do the dinner some other time.

1020
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,326
Weren't you the one who said,

1021
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,886
we were having dinner at their place?

1022
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,168
- Actually Amaya.. -
I'm not speaking with you.

1023
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,846
I'm speaking to my
mother if you don't mind.

1024
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,400
- Just stay out of
this. - Amaya how dare you?

1025
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,370
It's okay Leela, I should be leaving.

1026
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,488
No. You stay right here.

1027
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,401
I think Amaya just over-reacted.

1028
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,126
Devika,

1029
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,443
look at it from Amaya's point of view..

1030
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,922
How can she accept this relationship?

1031
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,162
Why?

1032
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,446
Amaya is a modern girl,

1033
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,931
she knows her mind.

1034
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,281
Being modern does not mean
that she's totally emotionless.

1035
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,365
Don't confuse both issues.

1036
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,601
- Listen Amaya. - No!

1037
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:09,761
You listen.

1038
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,047
I've heard whatever you have had to say,

1039
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,246
Now you listen.

1040
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,405
You've betrayed my father,

1041
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,046
you've embarrassed me,

1042
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,041
and you've changed..

1043
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,444
Suddenly now that
he's entered your life,

1044
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,329
your whole life has changed?

1045
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,605
I'm no longer important?

1046
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,329
And what were you thinking exactly?

1047
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,251
What am I supposed to say to my friends?

1048
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,005
Here's a wedding invitation,

1049
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,764
not to mine, but to my mother's wedding!

1050
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,603
And how will you break this to granny

1051
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,921
<i>and aunt?</i>

1052
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,047
What will you say to them?

1053
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,128
How will they feel?

1054
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,247
Have you even considered that at all?

1055
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,006
I hate you Ma.

1056
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,646
I hate who you've become.

1057
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,282
- Amaya I.. - Let her speak Leela.

1058
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,684
You obviously don't love dad.

1059
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,609
I loved your father,

1060
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,681
my husband.

1061
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,441
But I don't want to
spend the rest of my life,

1062
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,284
looking over my
shoulder at what could have been.

1063
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,725
He can never be my father.

1064
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,847
He will never take dad's place.

1065
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,046
NEVER.

1066
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,686
But you of course..

1067
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,641
What have I done?

1068
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,127
That was dad's and your bedroom Ma..

1069
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,486
You could have at least respected that.

1070
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,369
Amaya stop.

1071
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,721
That's it.

1072
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,646
Enough now.

1073
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,924
He makes me feel like a woman again.

1074
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,885
Isn't that what you said?

1075
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,161
What is it Ma?

1076
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,640
Is it just the sex?

1077
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,326
Had it been Aditi
who had just said this,

1078
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,486
I would have slapped her.

1079
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,966
I'll see you Leela.

1080
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,007
"O the dilemma,"

1081
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:19,124
"To do or not to do and what"

1082
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:25,242
"My heart and mind are far apart"

1083
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,281
"Love is strange"

1084
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:45,490
"For it makes you laugh and cry both"

1085
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,561
"Makes you dream.."

1086
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,531
"and takes sleep away"

1087
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,285
"What do I make of this dreamlike state"

1088
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,091
"For I know I am wide awake"

1089
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,845
"I walk on air and time stands still"

1090
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,085
"Do I even have a free will"

1091
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,767
"What is fact and what fiction?"

1092
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,571
"What is peace and what friction?"

1093
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,287
"O the dilemma,"

1094
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,091
"To do or not to do and what"

1095
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,800
"My heart and mind are far apart"

1096
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,488
"O the dilemma,"

1097
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,769
"To do or not to do and what"

1098
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:43,091
"My heart and mind are far apart"

1099
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,285
"O the dilemma"

1100
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,086
Sujata..

1101
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,322
Am I really being selfish?

1102
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,283
Have I betrayed Bala?

1103
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,647
"Closeness is a dilemma thing"

1104
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,566
"Because it does a distance bring"

1105
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,807
"And when you feel you're not alone"

1106
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,930
"You feel so far from yourself"

1107
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,611
"Like the sky that's
clear but for some cloud"

1108
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,411
"like gentle tears
that deep sorrow carry"

1109
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,051
"what then is close and what afar"

1110
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,045
"shall I go or shall I tarry"

1111
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,527
Hey! What's up?

1112
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,761
What's wrong?

1113
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,525
Cheer up darling..

1114
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,889
We all understand
what you're going through.

1115
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,801
No you don't Tariq.

1116
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,123
Okay okay..change topic, change topic.

1117
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,760
What's happening with the book?

1118
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,524
I really don't want to
talk about the book please.

1119
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,489
Why?

1120
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,562
We thought you were
really excited about this.

1121
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,051
Was excited"

1122
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,765
Look, can we please stop
talking about this damn book?

1123
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,567
Amaya, we're on your side by the way!

1124
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,244
Oh thank you!

1125
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,648
What makes you think,
I need people on my side?

1126
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,365
I should never have come here.

1127
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,643
Amaya?

1128
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,370
"O the dilemma,"

1129
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,523
"To do or not to do and what"

1130
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:40,640
"My heart and mind are far apart"

1131
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,324
"O the dilemma"

1132
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,921
"O the dilemma,"

1133
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,848
"O the dilemma,"

1134
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,606
"O the dilemma,"

1135
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,205
Sir, may I come in?

1136
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,640
Leela aunty?

1137
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,445
Aunty Leela..

1138
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,888
I'm here..in the store room.

1139
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,765
Come on out.

1140
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,561
What's this?

1141
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,441
Aunty?

1142
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,326
Has your labour union called a strike?

1143
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,529
Our demands be met, our only taunt.

1144
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,409
Cappuccinos twice a
day, are what we want!

1145
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,085
Raghav, what are you saying...?

1146
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,761
For the past two days, I've
been lugging this elephant around

1147
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,569
and your factory's
been locked up all this time!

1148
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,324
Factory? Elephant"?

1149
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,482
Forget it aunty,

1150
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,688
look what I have for you..

1151
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,570
So what is it?

1152
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,646
Drum roll please.

1153
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,441
I like it, it's lovely!

1154
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,842
WOW!

1155
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,251
Yeah, but looking at this place,

1156
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,482
It actually looks like it
needs people more than a signboard!

1157
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,721
Where is everyone?

1158
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,241
Ma!

1159
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,601
Ma?

1160
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,081
You want to get married, live
together" do whatever you want.

1161
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,082
It's your life, I really don't care.

1162
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,207
But you please tell Jazz..

1163
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,167
You please tell Jayant not to call me.

1164
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,287
I will not take his calls.

1165
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,487
Jayant?

1166
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,642
From here on, please
don't call Amaya again.

1167
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,806
You okay aunty?

1168
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,286
Hey Amaya..

1169
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,611
You only pretend to be a modern,

1170
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,284
open minded girl.

1171
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,608
The truth is that you
are actually a hypocrite.

1172
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,961
Fuck of Raghav!

1173
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,166
<i>Oh I will,</i>

1174
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,001
but why do you have to hurt her so much?

1175
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,002
Hurt her?

1176
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,405
Nobody understands how I'm feeling,

1177
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,528
it doesn't make a difference to anyone!

1178
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,921
And in any case, this is
none of your business, so..

1179
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,571
Listen listen" Do you actually believe

1180
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,404
that it doesn't make
a difference to anybody?

1181
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,571
Are you a child Amaya?

1182
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,244
- Look I'm not interested
in your.. - I'm not done yet.

1183
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,721
I was eight when my parents separated.

1184
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,811
Mum married again,

1185
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,245
but dad didn't..for us.

1186
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,050
My sister and I got
busy with our own lives,

1187
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,326
But dad..

1188
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,243
He just got so very lonely.

1189
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,728
It was sad to see him like that Amaya.

1190
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,483
We convinced him to get married again,

1191
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,164
and he did get married again.

1192
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,449
Look Amaya, I can understand

1193
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,885
that it might be embarrassing for you.

1194
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,450
What will people say and all of that.

1195
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,487
We were too"

1196
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,089
but we can't be so selfish.

1197
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,411
Amaya.. everything is not about you.

1198
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,609
Everyone knows that
you're fond of Jayant,

1199
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,920
so what is the problem?

1200
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,610
I'll tell you what
the problem is Raghav.

1201
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,166
The problem is that.

1202
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,970
Well the problem is..

1203
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,406
Problem is

1204
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,404
to know that your mother
is sleeping with another man.

1205
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,129
You disappoint me Amaya.

1206
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,450
Rizwaan bhai?

1207
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,731
Please come..have a seat.

1208
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,122
Did you have a watch for repair?

1209
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,487
No! I only came along to meet him.

1210
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,929
My father passed away last week.

1211
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,122
Your father was an extraordinary man.

1212
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,284
I had some of his snaps
that I wanted to give to him.

1213
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,645
Oh!

1214
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,602
So you are the one my father spoke of!

1215
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,285
He spoke of me?

1216
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,891
Yes..

1217
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,887
Everyone comes here

1218
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,247
to simply have their watches repaired.

1219
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,160
You were the only one,

1220
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,969
who came here to simply spend time..

1221
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,325
Which is probably why,
you stuck in my father's memory.

1222
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,927
These pictures will always bring back

1223
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,729
happy memories of my father.

1224
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,891
Rizwaan used to say that memories

1225
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,247
were never meant to
be stored in photographs,

1226
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,968
but in the mind instead.

1227
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,450
Aditi?

1228
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,211
Lunch is on the table.

1229
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,125
I'm not hungry.

1230
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,011
Why?

1231
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,045
What is the problem Amaya?

1232
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,927
When I am to eat,

1233
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,082
what time I'm to
sleep, whom I want to meet..

1234
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,090
Is my decision Ma.

1235
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,130
I'm not a child, and
you need to realize that.

1236
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,486
Accepted.

1237
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,245
But you also need to
realize, that I am still your mother.

1238
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,005
Please Ma, I'm really
in no mood to have a fight.

1239
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,648
So, now I can't even
ask you to eat on time?

1240
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,851
Amaya, listen to me!

1241
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,287
You constantly claim

1242
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,567
that you're grown up and mature.

1243
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,161
But grown up's don't behave like this!

1244
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,881
And when have I
treated you like a child?

1245
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,324
You've always done
what you've wanted to do,

1246
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,768
but that doesn't mean,
that I'll stop looking after you.

1247
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,890
Whenever you falter or fall,

1248
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,803
I will always be
there to help you back up.

1249
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,889
And that's never going to change.

1250
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,885
And I..

1251
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,290
I think I deserve a
little more respect from you.

1252
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,811
“Is it just the sex?“

1253
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,805
Isn't that what you asked me?

1254
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,685
Maybe we truly don't know each other.

1255
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,609
A part of me

1256
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,043
which died along with Bala,

1257
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,323
will probably never come back..

1258
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,686
But it's only after I met you,

1259
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:51,762
I realized that life is not
lived for the sake of memories,

1260
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,650
memories are only a
small part of our lives.

1261
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,882
How long have we known each other?

1262
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,569
Three? Three and a half years?

1263
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,050
It's really strange,

1264
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,207
how seamlessly and
naturally you fit into my life..

1265
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,210
It didn't feel like
anything had ever changed.

1266
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,090
I don't even remember,

1267
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,127
when I began trusting
you, more than l trusted myself.

1268
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,531
When you began to understand me,

1269
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,409
without me saying a single word.

1270
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,844
Which was that moment,

1271
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,843
where without so
much as holding my hand,

1272
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,284
you completely enveloped me.

1273
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,564
And irrespective of when this happened,

1274
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,449
I always felt that if I could
live out the rest of my life like this,

1275
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,251
so where was the harm?

1276
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,570
To be honest with you,

1277
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,971
it never crossed my mind,

1278
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,123
that I needed to define,

1279
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,807
or justify this relationship to anyone.

1280
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,844
Any happiness that I seek for myself,

1281
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,321
in which my daughter is unhappy..

1282
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,290
Is unacceptable to me.

1283
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,088
I wish we could have
spent our lives together.

1284
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,368
I've expressed it many times,

1285
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,564
but never openly said it before.

1286
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,480
I love you Leela,

1287
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,404
and I love Amaya too.

1288
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,126
I know..

1289
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,331
Thanks to this book,

1290
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,290
I've seen parts of this city
that I myself didn't know existed!

1291
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,680
Hi Mr. Khanna,

1292
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,081
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1293
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,571
Hi Amaya!

1294
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,610
What a pleasure to see you..

1295
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,125
I was just giving
Mr. Sinha the good news,

1296
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,921
that the first prints of your book,

1297
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,810
should arrive later this week.

1298
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,768
So lets further
this budding relationship.

1299
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,205
Why don't the both of you,

1300
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,966
start work on the sequel to this book?

1301
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,563
Mr. Khanna, this was one of my

1302
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,325
last surviving ambitions
in life, which is in the process

1303
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,684
of coming true through Amaya.

1304
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,041
So after this,

1305
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,929
I'm going to
actually retire into the hills.

1306
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,365
Spend some time alone,

1307
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,283
away from everyone and all attachments.

1308
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,331
And in any case,

1309
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,085
not all relationships get
to their desired destinations.

1310
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,962
Many remain
unfulfilled and incomplete too"

1311
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,605
Well, you're right.

1312
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,770
However, my offer is on the table.

1313
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,648
All the best to both of you,

1314
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,011
you two make a really good team.

1315
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,326
How are you Bahadur?

1316
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,606
All well?

1317
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,047
Oh God!

1318
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,691
I almost forgot.

1319
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,805
Here, I forgot to give you
something that belongs to you!

1320
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,044
What do you think?

1321
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,481
Isn't it nice!

1322
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,331
You're looking like a
complete film star here!

1323
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,210
So, will you send
these back to your village?

1324
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,047
Take care of yourself..

1325
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,851
What happened to your hand?

1326
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,131
Why didn't you tell me?

1327
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,045
So what can I get you, tell me?

1328
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,800
Two Costa Ricans

1329
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,207
okay"

1330
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,726
Anything else?

1331
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,121
Okay.

1332
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,126
Can I help with anything?

1333
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,202
Why are you asking?

1334
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,441
There are so many mugs lying there..

1335
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,760
Go clear them.

1336
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:33,090
To my little girl,
who wrote The Busy Bazaar.

1337
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,690
The night you were born,

1338
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,962
it was pouring rain.

1339
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,208
Dad and I waited 15 hours
to see you for the first time.

1340
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,607
We'd already
decided that if it was a girl,

1341
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,045
we would name her Amaya..

1342
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,366
Night rain.

1343
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,645
You brought us so much joy,

1344
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,960
and still do..

1345
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,889
I never meant to hurt you Amaya

1346
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,804
and I love you always.

1347
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,640
Ma.

1348
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,440
It's open.

1349
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,960
Hello Amaya!

1350
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,287
Aunty!

1351
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,880
Come..let me look at you!

1352
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,770
You look gorgeous!

1353
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,686
I missed you.

1354
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,600
So did I!

1355
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,887
Why didn't you come to meet me?

1356
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,404
I really wanted to see you..

1357
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,721
I know.

1358
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,248
Okay, so tell me ..how are you?

1359
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:36,966
Not okay.

1360
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,043
Hmmm..l know that as well.

1361
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,681
I'm not evil aunty,

1362
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,330
I'm not a bad person.

1363
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,885
So why does everyone think I am?

1364
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,650
I feel like such a villain!

1365
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,481
Of course you're not a bad person Amaya,

1366
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,730
but since when has it
started mattering to you,

1367
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,882
what other people think?

1368
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,764
It didn't matter earlier,

1369
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,649
but it's started mattering to me now.

1370
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,888
The situation you are in now,

1371
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,882
is not easy to deal with at all.

1372
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,529
What would you have done in my place?

1373
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,411
Now what's the point Amaya?

1374
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,965
Please tell me aunty,

1375
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,731
I really want to know.

1376
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,127
To tell you the truth,

1377
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,607
I don't know what I
would have done myself.

1378
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,606
Does grandma know?

1379
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,450
Grandma?

1380
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,963
Mummy always wanted

1381
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,769
Leela to settle down again.

1382
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:49,845
Leela's probably spent the
best years of her life alone,

1383
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,721
which is why we were very happy,

1384
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,007
to see Leela and Jayant together.

1385
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,125
Come on aunty,

1386
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,089
dad was your brother after all..

1387
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,171
That relationship
can never change Amaya,

1388
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,405
but on the back of old relationships,

1389
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,440
you don't stop making new ones.

1390
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,401
Anyhow, now nothing will change.

1391
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,004
What you want, is what will happen.

1392
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,641
Happy?

1393
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,121
You're right,

1394
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,081
what I fought for
against the entire world,

1395
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,006
has now happened.

1396
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,566
But I'm not happy.

1397
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,291
Why is that?

1398
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,120
I don't know..

1399
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,843
I can't seem to help thinking"

1400
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,889
not only did I lose dad a long time ago,

1401
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,570
but now I think, I've lost Ma too.

1402
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,450
I'm so sorry Ma..

1403
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,809
I'm so sorry.

1404
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,167
Okay.

1405
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,081
Very nice!

1406
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,926
It works.

1407
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,407
I want to meet with Jayant.

1408
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,691
Why?

1409
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,721
A lot of thought went
behind the decision we've taken.

1410
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,687
The decision may be wrong though?

1411
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,242
Well, if it's wrong, so be it.

1412
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,040
Don't worry.

1413
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,084
Why isn't someone opening the door?

1414
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,690
Hi..

1415
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,885
Please sit.

1416
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,404
Our book is being published today"

1417
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,930
I'm very happy for You-

1418
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,000
Jazz?

1419
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,362
Why do you never get angry?

1420
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,123
How can anybody be so good?

1421
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,410
You know, If dad were around,

1422
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,244
he would have
slapped some sense into me,

1423
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,924
a long time ago.

1424
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,930
I'm sorry.

1425
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,168
This book would never
have been completed without you.

1426
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:57,480
Come on!

1427
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,321
Jazz?

1428
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:09,966
So,

1429
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,284
are you going to give Ma a ring?

1430
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,245
Very Poor joke..

1431
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,241
Very poor!

1432
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,560
Horrible.

1433
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,604
Oh..

1434
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,846
Hi!

1435
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,850
Didn't you say you were leaving?

1436
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,565
Well if you so wish,
I can leave right now..

1437
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,921
Please..

1438
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,365
My God, both of you
are such drama queens!

1439
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,522
I'm a drama queen?

1440
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,965
Don't tell me..

1441
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,611
What!

1442
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,766
The book!

1443
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,365
My God!

1444
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,485
Look at this"

1445
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,606
Dear Ma,

1446
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,202
Thank you for always being
the most important part of my life,

1447
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,087
even when I lost my way recently.

1448
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,011
Dear Leela,

1449
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,890
for memories that will
last the rest of my life,

1450
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,360
affectionately,

1451
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,771
Jayant.

1452
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,690
WOW!

1453
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,565
Someone had once said,

1454
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,849
the day your first book gets published,

1455
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,642
we'll celebrate it with Champagne.

1456
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,207
Memories of the Busy Bazaar.

1457
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,921
Finally!

1458
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:21,567
Hey,

1459
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,767
why don't you get the book?

1460
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,008
Lets get a reading!

1461
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,361
Photo time"

1462
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,086
This is the time to get it all in!

1463
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,928
Photo, photo, photo..

1464
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,404
Lets have all your teeth in..

1465
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,402
Yes!

1466
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,609
Memories of the Busy Bazaar,

1467
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,526
foreword by

1468
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,725
Amaya Krishnamoorthy.

1469
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:50,924
No matter who you are,

1470
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,641
where you belong and
what language you speak,

1471
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,244
everyone at some time or
the other, has always said,

1472
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,965
I remember when..

1473
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,920
I remember the first
time my father slapped me.

1474
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,449
I remember when he said to me,

1475
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,370
you'll be famous.

1476
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:16,206
And I remember the day my father died.

1477
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,848
I remember when I learnt to write,

1478
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,764
I wrote a story in my own mind.

1479
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,729
I don't remember the
number of times I wept,

1480
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,650
But I cannot forget
each moment that I laughed.

1481
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,970
Everything that was dear to me,

1482
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,524
I preserved in my memories.

1483
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,201
Bye Ma!

1484
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,845
I saw happiness,

1485
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,126
and I saw my fair share of sorrow.

1486
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,121
But with time,

1487
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,569
even that stopped stinging.

1488
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,800
Guruji?

1489
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,446
Jazz?

1490
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,966
Hello!

1491
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,841
Why are you standing here?

1492
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,282
What's happened?

1493
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,608
I can't remember where I wanted to go.

1494
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,366
What do you mean, the
cafe's just around the corner..

1495
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,441
I never considered,

1496
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,760
whether I made my memories,

1497
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,410
or whether memories made up my life.

1498
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,890
Though I lived my
life through my memories..

1499
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,806
I can't remember,
which way I have to go.

1500
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,804
What can't you remember Jazz?

1501
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,361
The cafe is right here,

1502
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,646
are you okay?

1503
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,930
I can't remember Aditi..

1504
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,446
I can't remember, where I have to go.

1505
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,443
I can't remember..

1506
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,084
I kept every moment alive.

1507
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,725
I relived every memory,

1508
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,963
I often even spoke
with them like old friends.

1509
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:46,210
Not realizing, that
like sand through ones fingers,

1510
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,251
memories also don't
stay with you forever.

1511
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,364
Ma, Jazz can't remember..

1512
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:03,961
You knew?

1513
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,765
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1514
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,122
Living each moment that life offered up,

1515
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,680
maybe in this one
moment, I've found life itself.

1516
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,131
And this moment,

1517
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,887
even my memories can't snatch from me.

1518
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,363
Jayant had said one day,

1519
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,444
Leela you and I will
travel the world together.

1520
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,850
I hope he remembers.

1521
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,441
Amaya?

1522
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,642
I'm listening Ma.
