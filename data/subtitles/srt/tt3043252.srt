1
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,710
<i>Lajjo!</i> Cover your head.

2
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,050
This wind feels wild!

3
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,710
It's touching me everywhere!

4
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,890
<i>Rani?</i>

5
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,600
You want a taste?

6
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,300
She just turned 15.

7
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,510
You won't find a better bride for...

8
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,720
What's his name?

9
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,640
<i>Gulab.</i>

10
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,430
<i>Gulab</i> is my only son.

11
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,430
Really, <i>Tulsi...</i>

12
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,930
My worries are over.

13
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,180
I couldn't have found a more beautiful bride...

14
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,300
If I had looked with a lantern!

15
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,180
It's all God's will.

16
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,970
But for me,

17
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,850
God sent one daughter after another.

18
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,720
I have four more to marry off.

19
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,260
One less to worry about.

20
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,430
<i>Janaki</i> is ours now.

21
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,100
Wonderful!

22
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,680
Let us fix a date then.

23
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,470
Just one request...

24
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,430
Could the dowry be raised
from 3 <i>Lakh</i> to...

25
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,600
To 4 <i>Lakh?</i>

26
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,510
<i>Gulab,</i> your bride better have big boobs!

27
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,600
Or else get a refund!

28
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,140
I have to make a call.

29
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,470
You'll get it back, I need to call my Ma.

30
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,430
Please eat.

31
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,760
You have a long ride back.

32
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,760
Is she any good?

33
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,930
Worth the money?

34
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,220
Did they reduce the dowry?

35
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,760
Later...

36
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm still in the meeting.

37
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,430
Do your meeting Ma...

38
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,930
But listen...

39
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,180
I'll want a refund if she's rubbish!

40
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,220
What's the matter?

41
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,430
Hello! How is <i>Champa?</i>

42
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,050
I'm begging you...

43
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,300
Leave us alone!

44
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,720
Don't get an educated bride <i>Gulab.</i>

45
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,100
These educated types,

46
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,970
have books riding their minds...

47
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,140
Then what will we ride?

48
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,930
You got a problem?

49
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,600
Nah...

50
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,510
Just enjoying the view.

51
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,390
Careful or you'll enjoy a beating.

52
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Leave it <i>Kishan.</i>

53
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,930
They're not worth our time.

54
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,640
Witch!

55
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,050
How dare she look us in the eye!

56
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,890
Look at <i>Rani.</i> She's better than any son.

57
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,470
The way she takes care of
her mother-in-law.

58
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,550
<i>Gulab.</i> I said I'm in a meeting.

59
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,510
<i>Gulabo?</i>

60
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,970
Is that your name? Like a Rose?

61
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,010
Does every part of you smell like roses?

62
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,140
Who is this?

63
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,890
Your lover. Your hero.
Your <i>Shahrukh Khan!</i>

64
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,220
<i>Rani...</i>

65
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,300
That thing looks like trouble.

66
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,760
It's new, <i>Gulab</i> bought it for me.

67
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm still learning it.

68
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,550
What an exciting place to keep it!

69
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,550
Ma is saying this now,

70
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,220
but she cursed me every
time I birthed a daughter.

71
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,140
You with your raging hormones.

72
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,010
Couldn't keep your skirt down!

73
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,720
She was a girl-vending machine!

74
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,640
It's the same everywhere Ma.

75
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,430
If men had their way
they'd be pounding us round-the-clock.

76
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,680
Thankfully God created
barren women like me!

77
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,930
Or else the volume of babies produced,

78
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,850
Would fill a whole new nation!

79
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,850
What beautiful eyes.

80
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,550
Such long luscious hair.

81
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,180
<i>Gulab</i> won't believe his luck
when he sees you!

82
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,640
<i>Namaste.</i>

83
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,010
Tell me truthfully <i>Lajjo.</i>

84
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
My hair is graying.

85
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,300
My eyes are turning weak too.

86
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,970
Last night I didn't recognize
myself in the mirror.

87
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,220
Do I even look like a woman?

88
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,720
Let's see...

89
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,600
Your eyes are so deep...

90
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,430
Like whirlpools to drown in.

91
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,850
Your mouth is like luscious berries

92
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,510
I want to suck the juice from them.

93
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,970
Duffer!

94
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,600
If only you were a man!

95
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,470
Then I'd get under that skirt!

96
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Stop!

97
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,890
Tell me something.

98
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,430
Who is this <i>Shahrukh Khan?</i>

99
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,390
Is he a film hero?

100
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,010
<i>Shahrukh Khan??</i>

101
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,760
Not just any hero.

102
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,220
He's the hottest!

103
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,140
<i>Manoj</i> took me to his film once.

104
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,260
Why do you ask?

105
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,140
He called my mobile.
Must have been a mistake.

106
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,100
Let me see!

107
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,430
<i>Shahrukh Khan</i> called!
And you didn't tell me?

108
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,720
It has come to our notice...

109
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,350
<i>Champa</i> has run away
from her in-laws' home.

110
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,550
Before trouble starts
between the families...

111
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,100
She must go back.

112
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,550
I won't go back!

113
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,510
My husband doesn't give a damn!

114
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,430
I've come home to my parents'...

115
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,760
How is that wrong?

116
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,390
After marriage,
your parent's home is not yours.

117
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,890
Go home to your husband.

118
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,640
Go back before you bring shame to our village.

119
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,720
<i>Lakdi</i> manage your daughter.

120
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,850
Just like we managed <i>Ganga</i> last year?

121
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,220
What happened to her?

122
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,470
She committed suicide.

123
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
Times have changed <i>Kheema.</i>

124
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,260
So should we.

125
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,300
Or we'll suffer.

126
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,850
Quiet <i>Kishan!</i>

127
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,800
Don't interfere with the Elders!

128
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,470
You've shamed the village enough...

129
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,680
By bringing in a foreigner bride.

130
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,260
You shamelessly
parade her on your bike!

131
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,470
Keep out of our business!

132
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm not some alien from outer space.

133
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,350
My name is <i>Naobi.</i> I'm also an Indian.

134
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,550
My husband drives me to the bus stop,

135
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,890
So I can teach the children in the next village.

136
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,600
What is shameful about that?

137
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,930
Do not flaunt your education here!

138
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,100
We also educate our kids!

139
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,760
As for you <i>Champa...</i>

140
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,010
This village is as much
mine as it is yours!

141
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,220
Society has rules for a reason.

142
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,930
Don't question the Elders!

143
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,010
We won't survive without their support!

144
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,850
Their support can go to hell!

145
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,720
Okay... Calm down.

146
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,010
Moving on.

147
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,640
<i>Devi...</i>

148
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,350
Head of the village women,
has something to say.

149
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,350
<i>Namaste.</i>

150
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,180
The women have a request...

151
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,800
The trucking contracts
keep our men away for weeks.

152
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,550
While we women are trapped
inside our homes.

153
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,430
We are the last village without TV.

154
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,550
TV would entertain the men too.

155
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,390
Then they wouldn't need to
visit the Dance Company...

156
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,600
We already regret giving
into your last demand.

157
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,300
You demanded mobile phones,

158
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,010
To keep track of your husbands.

159
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
We relented.

160
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,800
But what happened?

161
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,600
<i>Shiva's</i> daughter eloped with
a man she met on the mobile.

162
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,680
In the next village...

163
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,640
Girls who watched TV
started wearing jeans pant.

164
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,970
Hear this brothers...

165
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,300
Next thing we know...

166
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,550
These women will be
driving our trucks too!

167
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,350
Then there's the matter of money.

168
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
A TV dish is expensive.

169
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,930
<i>Kishan</i> has negotiated...

170
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,890
A large order for our handicrafts.

171
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,890
We will get paid before
the <i>Dussehra</i> festival.

172
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,350
We women will pool our earnings,

173
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,100
And buy a TV for the village.

174
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,100
First get the money. Then we'll see.

175
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,850
And with that...

176
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,720
This meeting comes to a close.

177
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,600
Hail Lord <i>Ram!</i>

178
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,010
Hail Lord <i>Krishna!</i>

179
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,010
Ma! Don't send me back!

180
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,260
You should be grateful.

181
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,930
Your in-laws
have agreed to take you back!

182
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,550
They have forgiven you!

183
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,100
Forgiven? What for?

184
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,890
My husband doesn't
even touch me.

185
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,640
He has a mistress
in the next village.

186
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,850
Quiet, <i>Champa!</i>

187
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,640
You have shamed us enough!

188
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,010
I take responsibility for her!

189
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,350
<i>Kishan and Naobi</i> will employ me.

190
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,050
You stay out of this <i>Kishan!</i>

191
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,430
How dare you speak for her!

192
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,300
My brother-in-law forces himself on me!

193
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,760
All the men in the house don't
miss an opportunity to fuck me.

194
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,680
Even my father-in-law!

195
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,640
Can you bear to hear more?

196
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,300
I had to abort a child because
I didn't know who the father was!

197
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,260
Ma... they will kill me!

198
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,850
Don't send me to that hell!

199
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,800
She'll come around.

200
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,930
All will be well.

201
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,050
I look like a clown!

202
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,800
Like a Prince!

203
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,890
Such a beautiful face.

204
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,550
Eyes just like your father's.

205
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,640
I'm not a girl!

206
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Beautiful? Grandma tell her...

207
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,550
Have you seen <i>Kishan's</i> wife?

208
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,010
Brazenly rides the bus alone!

209
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,050
Exposes her midriff to the world!

210
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,260
That is <i>Kishan's</i> business.

211
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,640
All his education drivel
is corrupting our village.

212
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,220
You stay out of it.

213
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,350
You know as a child,
I loved reading books too.

214
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,800
But my mother said,

215
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,550
"Girls who read make bad wives."

216
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,680
So, she married me off at 14.

217
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,800
You're trapping me the same way!

218
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,510
And why did you build this wall?

219
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Oh... You'll see...

220
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,970
After your wedding!

221
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,550
Now listen, don't take on a new contract.

222
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,300
I need you at home.

223
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,720
No way! It's my last days of bachelorhood.

224
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,600
I'll call you from the mobile.

225
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,680
I won't answer.

226
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,640
See you in a few days.

227
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,050
Take care Grandma.

228
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,600
Ma...

229
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,220
Our boy is becoming a man.

230
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,390
<i>Lajjo!</i>

231
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,180
Is the wedding order ready?

232
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,510
It's due in 2 days!

233
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,800
Just one blouse left.

234
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,010
I tried some new designs,

235
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,510
From that magazine you gave me.

236
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,300
Yes...

237
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,010
<i>Naobi, meet Rani and Lajjo...</i>

238
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,640
Very important members
of my craft team.

239
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,260
And this is <i>Naobi.</i> My new bride.

240
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,640
She is college educated.

241
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,850
Speaks English fluently.

242
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,930
She negotiated our new contract.

243
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,180
Soon our business will boom.

244
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,300
You're so beautiful!

245
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,180
Such soft skin!

246
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,140
Fair like a foreigner.

247
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,720
<i>Kishan</i> you have a good eye.

248
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,010
Let's meet tomorrow.

249
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,050
I'll arrange the advance till then.

250
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,760
I've heard foreign women bathe
in milk. That's why they glow.

251
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,050
Duffer!

252
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,260
Only one thing makes a woman glow...

253
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,100
Not milk, soap or cream.

254
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,260
In <i>Bijli's</i> words...

255
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,550
It's called sex!

256
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,850
That's why you and I look so sad!

257
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,970
What's the date today?

258
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,600
I heard the dance company is here.

259
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,430
Lets go to see <i>Bijli</i> tonight!

260
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,140
<i>BIJLI...</i> The Earthquake-maker!!!

261
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,180
The Dance Company is back!

262
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,760
Once again in your village!

263
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,510
A night of lust and passion...

264
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,680
With the queen! <i>Bijli!</i>

265
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,600
First show tonight at 8!

266
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,600
<i>Pull out your wallets,
the Earthquake-maker is here!</i>

267
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,010
<i>Shake it my prince...</i>

268
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,640
<i>Shake it Inspector...</i>

269
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,300
<i>Sit back, relax Inspector...
you're off duty now!</i>

270
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,100
<i>Shake it my Prince...</i>

271
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,470
<i>Shake it Inspector...</i>

272
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,550
<i>I will shake down your courtiers...</i>

273
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,680
<i>Turn their squirrels to snakes...</i>

274
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,180
<i>I will break your pride...</i>

275
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,010
<i>I will disrupt your peace!</i>

276
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,100
<i>I will zap your brains...</i>

277
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,680
<i>I will make...</i>

278
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,430
<i>I will make...</i>

279
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,680
<i>I will make your earth shake...</i>

280
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,680
<i>I will make your earth shake...</i>

281
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,100
<i>I will make an earthquake in your bed.</i>

282
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,470
<i>Yes, an earthquake in your bed.</i>

283
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,050
She agreed to sex you up for 500.

284
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,970
You have an hour.

285
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,550
Go get deflowered!

286
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,390
Make your father proud!

287
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,470
I hope your shooter works.

288
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,140
Like an AK-47!

289
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,180
<i>When I stretch like this...</i>

290
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,300
<i>Even the morning gets shy...</i>

291
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,800
<i>When my anklets ring...</i>

292
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,970
<i>The earth comes alive...</i>

293
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,350
<i>I'm an angel...</i>

294
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,220
<i>A witch...</i>

295
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,100
<i>A babe...</i>

296
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,100
<i>A bitch...</i>

297
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,720
<i>No innocent flower.</i>

298
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,850
<i>Go ahead deflower!</i>

299
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,720
<i>She will make the earth shake.</i>

300
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,140
<i>She will make the earth shake.</i>

301
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,550
<i>She will bring an earthquake in the bed.</i>

302
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,390
Look <i>Bijli...</i>

303
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,470
We don't turn away clients.

304
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,510
Make your money while they still want you.

305
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,470
My heart's not in it.

306
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,430
Get it?

307
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,640
Life's more than just money and sex.

308
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,720
And don't start about
bringing on a new girl.

309
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,010
Or I'll run off to Mumbai!

310
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,140
Aha! Marilyn Monroe
and her stardom dreams...

311
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,140
I've been hearing this for 3 years.

312
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,600
Listen... I'm like your father.

313
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,300
So I'll tell you the truth.

314
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,010
You are a whore.

315
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,470
And will always be a whore.

316
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,850
So shut up and go earn!

317
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,220
In that case daddy dearest...

318
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,720
I have a request.

319
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,430
My body is a little wrung out today...

320
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,800
Tell your client to come another night.

321
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,260
This shop is closed!

322
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,600
Here is your bottle.

323
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,140
I am glad you refused that client.

324
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,470
Why?

325
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,890
Thought you'd get lucky tonight?

326
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,970
<i>Bijli...</i>

327
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,970
Please shut your tent securely at night.

328
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,640
When I came to wake you today, your skirt...

329
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,260
Why is it you always wake me?

330
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,350
Does the boss pay you extra for it?

331
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,640
You'd prefer someone else?

332
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,300
I wish!

333
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,010
But just my luck...

334
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,220
You are my only cuckoo clock.

335
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,390
<i>Bijli...</i> You're back!

336
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,390
<i>Lajjo!</i> It's been ages!

337
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,140
Hello!

338
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,010
Goodbye!

339
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,470
Yeah... I'm going.

340
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,640
Hey <i>Rani...</i>

341
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,720
So I said to the boss...

342
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,220
"No way. Go to hell!"

343
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,180
From now on...<i>Bijli</i> opens only for love.

344
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,300
You want to give up your life
and become like us?

345
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,390
She's lost it!

346
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,390
Can't she see how
boring and sad we are?

347
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,600
Come here... I have a secret.

348
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,390
I met a man in the last village.

349
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,720
He taught me to dream.

350
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,050
Rocked me to the
moon and back all night.

351
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,430
In the morning he said...

352
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,970
"Hey <i>Bijju...</i> dream away."

353
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,890
"Your whole life is ahead of you."

354
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,300
What a man!

355
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,550
I'm still burning up.

356
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,260
Those long dancing fingers...

357
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,050
Soft tickling moustache.

358
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,510
Hang on!

359
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,350
Should I imagine fingers or moustache?

360
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,890
You choose.

361
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,470
He stroked me the whole night...

362
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,720
Pressed all the right buttons.

363
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,970
I went straight to heaven!

364
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,260
And then he aroused me...

365
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,220
With his words!

366
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,760
I doubt I've ever spoken
so much in my life!

367
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,390
Did you tell <i>Bijli?</i>

368
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,930
No?

369
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,220
<i>Gulab's</i> date is fixed!

370
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,220
We found him a bride!

371
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,890
Wedding is on the 9th.

372
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,550
Her blouse was so tight...

373
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,510
No wonder men fall at her feet!

374
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,100
I think <i>Bijli</i> makes up these stories.

375
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,470
I have never heard of a man
talking during the act!

376
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,680
Hello?

377
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,100
<i>Gulabo,</i> why are you panting?

378
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,470
I am out of breath.

379
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,390
What are you up to?

380
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,680
I'm walking. What's it to you?

381
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,850
I think I'm falling in love.

382
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,390
Do you feel the flutter too?

383
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,760
No!

384
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,600
Will you be my Valentine?

385
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:57,800
What?

386
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,180
Valentine?

387
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,140
Valentine day?

388
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,720
It's a day for naughty love.

389
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,800
I've got to go!

390
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,890
That was <i>Shahrukh Khan.</i>

391
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,050
First call was by mistake.

392
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,800
Now he calls all the time.

393
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,350
Says naughty things.

394
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,350
He calls me <i>Gulabo...</i> His rose.

395
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,890
He's outrageous!

396
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,390
You're blushing.

397
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,930
Maybe I should tell him the truth?

398
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,640
About the real me?

399
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Is this all wrong <i>Lajjo?</i>

400
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,140
Why wrong?

401
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,140
Ma, remember when I'd spilled water...

402
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,300
And you slipped on it?

403
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,350
I'd burst out laughing.
I was so young!

404
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,550
What a beating you gave me that day.

405
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,850
Your son <i>Shankar,</i>
had to save me.

406
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,970
But who could save me from <i>Shankar?</i>

407
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,720
When he started staying out all night...

408
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,760
You said...

409
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,430
"All will be well."

410
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,800
When he kept that mistress...

411
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,470
Again you said... "All will be well."

412
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,890
When <i>Shankar</i> died in that accident...

413
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,930
First you cursed me...

414
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,100
And then said... "All will be well."

415
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,180
But nothing changed.

416
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,850
Years passed... <i>Gulab</i> grew up.

417
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,300
And I...

418
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,510
Once <i>Gulab's</i> bride gets here...

419
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,260
It'll be my turn to lie on a cot...
and all will be well.

420
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,470
What you doing <i>Lajjo?</i>

421
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,100
Going for a competition?

422
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,180
No... I have a delivery tomorrow.

423
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,300
What?

424
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,050
A delivery.

425
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,850
What do you know about "delivery"?

426
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,390
You, with your infertile womb.

427
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,050
Booze has drowned all the love inside you.

428
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,640
No... no... no... no!

429
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,760
What did you say bitch?

430
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,390
If I hadn't spent so much on you.

431
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,100
I'd have trashed you long ago!

432
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,800
I'm not your whore!

433
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,100
What?

434
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,350
I'm not your whore.

435
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,640
Barren bitch!

436
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,550
Don't! Please!

437
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,970
The donkey chose water over booze.

438
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,850
So the moral of the story is...

439
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,680
A man who doesn't booze is an Ass!

440
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,890
Right <i>Gulab?</i>

441
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,550
Man up! Have a drink!

442
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,430
When is your date with God oldie?

443
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,220
Marry me? What say?

444
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,350
He's so sweet in public,
such a monster at home.

445
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,970
Last night he was so drunk.

446
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,510
He said to me...

447
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,220
"No matter how deep I drill...
You remain a barren desert."

448
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,180
Why is she crying so much?

449
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,180
Has she found out...

450
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,600
About your tiny willy?

451
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,510
<i>Rani</i> I need to show you something.

452
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,180
What's this?

453
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,850
Her hair was infested with lice.

454
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,550
There was no other way.

455
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,100
I asked her father to postpone...

456
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,140
But he refused.

457
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,430
Said that the money's been taken.

458
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,890
Is this what I paid for?

459
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,510
I'll lose face in my community!

460
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,220
For the sake of both our families,
please take her.

461
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,470
I apologize on behalf of my entire family.

462
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,300
Please take her <i>Rani...</i> Please.

463
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,680
<i>Our precious daughter.</i>

464
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,720
<i>Beautiful as a flower.</i>

465
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,890
<i>She doesn't know how much she is loved.</i>

466
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:42,050
<i>Goodbye darling,
you leave us with a heavy heart!</i>

467
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,640
<i>The animals and birds will miss you...</i>

468
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,970
<i>Trees and plants will go dry...</i>

469
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,970
<i>You are the center of our Universe...</i>

470
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,930
<i>Our precious daughter.</i>

471
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,550
<i>Beautiful as a flower.</i>

472
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,970
<i>Our precious daughter.</i>

473
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,970
<i>God Himself watches over you.</i>

474
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,760
<i>Because you are God's favorite too.</i>

475
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,300
<i>Namaste.</i>

476
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,640
Congratulations <i>Gulab!</i>

477
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,800
A small gift for the bride.

478
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,600
When you finish reading these.
I'll give you more.

479
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,390
I live just two lanes away.

480
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,390
Your bride will be smarter than you <i>Gulab!</i>

481
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,260
She'll make more money too!

482
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,010
Put out the candles,
the Earthquake cometh!

483
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,680
It's the Queen of the Dance Company!

484
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,390
She has some guts coming here!

485
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,600
She is <i>Rani's</i> friend from childhood.

486
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,010
<i>Rani!</i>

487
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,180
Congratulations!

488
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,220
Many many congratulations!!

489
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,890
Oh I know...

490
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,890
I've come a bit early.

491
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,470
Huh?

492
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,890
I should have waited till everyone left.

493
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,850
But I was too excited!

494
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,890
And look! I even forgot <i>Gulab's</i> gift!

495
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:47,930
Ok...

496
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,470
I'll leave.

497
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,180
Don't want to spoil this night for you.

498
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,010
Everything is ruined Ma.

499
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,470
<i>Gulab</i> won't even look at me.

500
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,300
He thinks I did it on purpose.

501
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,140
I thought I'd finally rest easy tonight.

502
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,760
But everything is ruined.

503
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,680
Here, take a sip.

504
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,550
Ma?

505
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,050
<i>Gulab!</i>

506
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,510
My mother said...

507
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,550
She died of shock
from seeing your bald bride.

508
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,850
<i>Rani</i> spent a fortune on your joke-bride.

509
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,430
The oldie died laughing.

510
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,550
Where have you been for the last 2 days?

511
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,010
Are you drunk again?

512
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,300
What's your name?

513
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,510
<i>Janaki.</i>

514
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,640
<i>Janaki.</i>

515
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,300
Take this off.

516
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,010
Why?

517
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,680
What are you doing?

518
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,350
Lie down.

519
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,550
Come here.

520
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,430
Don't do that!

521
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,510
Shhh...

522
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,800
Please!

523
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,600
<i>Bijli?</i>

524
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,050
One second...

525
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,550
<i>Rani?</i>

526
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,930
It's late!

527
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,050
Come in!

528
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,180
What's wrong?

529
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,350
<i>Rani?</i>

530
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,680
<i>Bijli.</i>

531
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,600
Forgive me for the other night.

532
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,350
Are you crazy <i>Rani?</i>

533
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,260
It was my fault!

534
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,890
I shouldn't have come.

535
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,300
I was just so excited!

536
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,800
Look. You're sorry. I'm sorry.

537
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,600
Our sorrys cancel out!

538
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,350
Tell me about the wedding.

539
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,850
How is the groom?

540
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,300
It's <i>Gulab's</i> wedding night.

541
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,430
I forced him to marry her.

542
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,850
I have ruined his life!

543
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,010
No, <i>Rani!</i>

544
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,010
Just watch! In no time...

545
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,470
<i>Janaki</i> will have him
wrapped around her finger.

546
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,850
It's not a big deal!

547
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,050
It's just hair!

548
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,720
<i>Bijli.</i>

549
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,720
How is your hair so beautiful?

550
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,640
Always so perfect?

551
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,720
You're so fair...

552
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,220
But you are the dark horse...

553
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,300
With a wild streak!

554
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,720
<i>Bijli?</i>

555
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,100
<i>Bijli!</i>

556
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,220
Yes?

557
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,300
The boss sent your share.

558
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,050
He said a big client
is coming tomorrow.

559
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,470
Ok.

560
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,970
What is it <i>Raju?</i>

561
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,550
Is there someone with you?

562
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,350
You can play detective tomorrow.

563
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,140
Now good night!

564
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,760
Darling...

565
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,430
Sweet dreams...

566
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,300
Sweetest dreams to you too <i>Bijli.</i>

567
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,180
You're going to work <i>Gulab?</i>

568
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,010
"Such long luscious hair <i>Gulab..."</i>

569
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,390
"You'll be stunned by her beauty!"

570
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,180
There, I'm stunned.

571
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,970
Worry not Mother,

572
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,220
I've performed my husbandly duties.

573
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,970
Finally... The Princess wakes.

574
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,430
This isn't your mother's house.

575
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,550
There.

576
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,140
Chop this.

577
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,970
Do some work.

578
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,220
Cover your head.

579
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,890
You've shamed me enough already.

580
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,140
Not on the floor!

581
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,510
Didn't your mother teach you anything?

582
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,800
They sold me a useless goat.

583
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,680
I squashed her boobs...

584
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,720
Then I slammed into her!

585
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,970
Showed her who's the boss!

586
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,100
Lucky bastard, getting double action.

587
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,010
Got a bride and a whore.

588
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,350
<i>Gulab!</i>

589
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,260
Stop! That's <i>Kishan's</i> stuff!

590
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,680
Bastard! That skirt-fucker!

591
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,850
Challenges the village Elders!

592
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,100
Sisterfucker!

593
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,930
That motherfucker.

594
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,850
Piss on his handicrafts!

595
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,600
What will he sell now?

596
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,140
Hey... grab a stack!

597
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,970
Dick!

598
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,680
Corrupting our women...

599
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,260
Let's show him!

600
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,510
Stop asshole!

601
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,510
My Ma stitched that!

602
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,510
Fucker!

603
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,350
Run!

604
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,510
What's going on?

605
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,300
Fuck you <i>Kishan!</i>

606
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,800
<i>Gulab?</i>

607
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,350
Where have you been?

608
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,260
I came by your house... it was locked.

609
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,470
What happened?

610
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,850
<i>Shahrukh Khan?</i>

611
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:46,890
Ma?

612
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,300
Ma the dough is ready.
Should I fire the stove?

613
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,510
Yes.

614
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,510
What happened?

615
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,180
Who did this?

616
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,890
Forget it <i>Rani.</i>

617
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,300
Some people don't like progress.

618
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,180
But we will not back down.

619
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,470
We'll continue our work quietly.

620
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,220
Why is everyone in this village
deaf and mute?

621
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,970
Why don't you tell her the truth?

622
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,970
<i>Gulab</i> has gone mad!

623
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,890
Look what he did!

624
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,430
Control your son!

625
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,470
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"

626
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,010
"How I wonder-"

627
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,930
Get inside! Now!

628
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,970
Haven't you been told?

629
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,510
Girls who read make bad wives!

630
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,260
Learn to please your husband!

631
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,720
Or he'll dump you and never look back!

632
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,430
Hello?

633
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,640
Not <i>Gulabo! My name is Rani.</i>

634
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,930
<i>Rani Kanwar Jaiswal!</i>

635
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,680
A 32 year old widow,
with a 17 year old son.

636
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,220
My eyes are getting weak! My back hurts!

637
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,470
Want to hear more?

638
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,970
It's been 15 years since
I've been touched by a man.

639
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,350
Tell me <i>Shahrukh Khan...</i>

640
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,760
Where and when do you want to meet?

641
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,220
And then...

642
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,300
His pants tore open...

643
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,720
To unleash his dragon.

644
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,470
But as soon as his dragon got out...

645
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,350
It shrunk into a mouse.

646
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
What is this <i>Bijli?</i>

647
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,470
How long can we sit like this?

648
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,800
Its mud from the ocean floor...

649
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:17,140
It will make you look 16 again.

650
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,220
No mud can bring back my lost years.

651
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,890
What's with the mood <i>Rani?</i>

652
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,550
Did you fight with your mobile lover?

653
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:27,680
<i>Shahrukh Khan.</i>

654
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,260
Oh! <i>Shahrukh Khan!</i>

655
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,640
Don't frown!

656
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,180
You'll get wrinkles!

657
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,010
Then he won't call you!

658
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,350
No phone. No tring tring.

659
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,220
He won't be calling again.

660
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,050
Ever!

661
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,140
I don't need wrinkles to put him off.

662
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,800
I told him the truth about me.

663
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,970
Off he ran! Tail between his legs.

664
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
<i>Lajjo!</i>

665
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,390
Don't keep roaming around!

666
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,300
Go fix me a meal. I'm starving.

667
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,140
You better go.

668
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,760
You'll get the money.

669
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,010
I assure you.

670
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,100
Look... There's his mother.

671
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,680
<i>Gulab</i> is in trouble.

672
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,890
He owes them money.

673
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,640
Pay up now!

674
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,100
I need time to arrange for the rest.

675
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,890
Sir. Could we get an advance?

676
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:05,850
It's an emergency.

677
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,930
Yes. We'll deliver on time.

678
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,760
I sold my wedding necklace.
I'm still 5000 short.

679
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,760
Don't worry. We'll get the money.

680
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:19,890
It's done!

681
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:39,970
Mother dear...

682
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,010
You brought my money?

683
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,260
Where is it?

684
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,800
He owes me for more than a month now!

685
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,850
I run a business after all!

686
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,430
Little motherfucker!

687
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,600
Don't have a dime in your pocket!

688
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,100
Calling mommy to save you?

689
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,350
You want free sex?

690
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,180
Get it from your wife!

691
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,970
Bloody dogs in heat!

692
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,390
Always looking for a quick fuck!

693
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:40,930
<i>Janaki!</i>

694
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,680
<i>Rani?</i>

695
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:13,350
Ma's not home. She's gone to the city.

696
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,680
You have completely disgraced us!

697
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,890
I was already in debt from your wedding!

698
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,930
And now this!

699
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,180
It's your fault!

700
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,470
I didn't even want to get married!

701
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,600
Send her back and get a refund.

702
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,600
Anyway she's bloody defective.

703
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,140
You'll trade your wife
for booze and whores?

704
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,930
It's only money, okay!

705
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:43,470
Light yourself another.

706
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:44,930
Where is everyone?

707
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,430
Boss has gone to the Village Elders.

708
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,010
To plead our case.

709
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,390
Why?

710
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,550
The village women are asking for a TV.

711
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,680
If that happens <i>Bijli,</i>

712
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,390
we'll be out of business.

713
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,220
What bullshit!

714
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,680
TV can't replace <i>Bijli's</i> thunder.

715
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,220
No <i>Bijli!</i>

716
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,470
Yes <i>Raju!</i>

717
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,100
<i>Bijli</i> No!

718
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,510
<i>Raju</i> Yes!

719
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,430
C'mon, <i>Lajjo.</i>

720
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,300
Can anyone stop you <i>Bijli?</i>

721
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,100
No!

722
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,970
Then go!

723
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,640
Move your stupid sheep!

724
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:41,800
<i>Rani!</i>

725
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,550
You two look like monkeys!

726
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,300
Hey Elephant Queen!

727
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,550
Ride with us to the zoo!

728
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,550
Come on!

729
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,600
I'll die before I'm seen on that!

730
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,260
You're both insane!

731
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,640
Forget what others say...

732
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,260
Follow your heart <i>Rani!</i>

733
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,180
<i>Bijli's</i> craziness is infectious!

734
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,800
Come be crazy with us!

735
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,760
What will people say?

736
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:12,390
They'll say "Rani's having fun!"

737
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,300
Hurry or everyone will see!

738
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,010
<i>Janaki's</i> really an innocent.

739
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,510
May she remain so forever.

740
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:08,220
Don't nag her to have children soon.

741
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,640
But she must bear children!

742
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,680
Without bearing a child...

743
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,390
A woman's life is nothing!

744
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,600
<i>Rani!</i>

745
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,680
You talk such shit sometimes.

746
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,050
A woman has value, even without a child.

747
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:30,140
We weren't born just to bear children!

748
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,850
<i>Lajjo...</i>

749
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,930
Don't worry.

750
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,550
You can't give up.

751
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,350
Life can't be that unfair.

752
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,850
We have just one life.

753
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,390
We too will find our share of happiness.

754
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,260
Have faith.

755
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,100
Wait a minute!

756
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,260
Maybe he's the problem!

757
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:53,390
Huh?

758
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,300
Tell <i>Manoj</i> to get himself tested.

759
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,010
What?

760
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,180
What do you mean?

761
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,180
Men can be infertile too!

762
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,800
It's not always a woman's fault.

763
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,470
Get <i>Manoj</i> tested.

764
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:11,180
Lets see who's barren. Him or you?

765
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:12,800
Are you saying?

766
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,550
That I could be a mother someday?

767
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,180
Men can be infertile?

768
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:20,140
Absolutely!

769
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,140
I didn't know that was possible!

770
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,350
How can we test this?

771
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,510
<i>Bijli,</i> do you have a magic potion?

772
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,680
Or...

773
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:32,680
A doctor, a priest or a healer?

774
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,510
Those frauds can't get you a baby.

775
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,430
Let me think.

776
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,050
I'll figure something.

777
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,760
But first you tell me...

778
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,550
Why do you want a child so badly?

779
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,350
To save your marriage?

780
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,850
What kind of a question is that <i>Bijli?</i>

781
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,010
I want the joy of having a child!

782
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,680
<i>Manoj</i> can beat me all he wants,

783
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,220
but I won't be beaten by fate.

784
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,300
If I can have a child,

785
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,850
I want one.

786
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,430
That motherfucker...

787
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,140
He's hurt you so much.

788
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,760
Motherfucker.

789
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,510
Who invented these cuss words?

790
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,470
I bet it was man.

791
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,890
Why is a woman getting
fucked in every cuss?

792
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:25,760
Motherfucker! Sisterfucker!

793
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,680
It's time the men got fucked!

794
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,010
Sonfucker!

795
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:36,100
<i>Bijli!</i>

796
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:37,390
Sonfucker!

797
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,050
Unclefucker! Fatherfucker!

798
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,010
Brotherfucker!

799
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,550
Shout it out <i>Rani!</i>

800
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,930
Shout it!

801
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,050
Fatherfucker! Sonfucker!

802
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,640
Sonfucker!

803
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,300
Brotherfucker!!!

804
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,890
What's happening to <i>Rani?</i>

805
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,510
You're sitting on <i>Shahrukh Khan!</i>

806
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,970
See what I mean?

807
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,550
Who needs men...

808
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:17,050
When a mobile can get us off!

809
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,890
This will free us from men!

810
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,010
Hail the mobile!

811
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,180
Hail the vibrating signal provider!

812
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,390
It's stopped vibrating!

813
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,300
Wait it's happening again!

814
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,100
Hey... It's <i>Gulab.</i>

815
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,390
Hello?

816
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,510
I'm out.

817
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,720
<i>Janaki</i> is with me.

818
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,760
What?

819
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,720
Fix your own dinner.

820
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,100
We'll be home late.

821
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,600
That's right.

822
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,510
Was that <i>Gulab?</i>

823
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,260
<i>Rani...</i>

824
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,760
He's getting out of hand.
You need to control him.

825
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,050
<i>Janaki.</i>

826
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,010
Go wait by the bike.

827
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,550
We're leaving soon.

828
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,260
Go.

829
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,970
It's good you sent her away.

830
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,800
<i>Gulab</i> has gone mad...

831
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:27,930
Forget about <i>Gulab!</i>

832
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,640
Worry about yourself.

833
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,050
The village women have
complained to the Elders...

834
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,550
That you lure their husbands.

835
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,390
The Elders called your boss.

836
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:40,930
Right?

837
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:44,140
They're going to shut down your tent.

838
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,390
Aah!

839
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,350
I get it.

840
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,970
Their husbands come
to me of their own free will...

841
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,350
And that's my fault?

842
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,100
<i>Gulab</i> goes to a whore...

843
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:00,550
That whore in the city!

844
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,470
And that's my fault?

845
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:03,930
And <i>Lajjo!</i>

846
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,890
Your husband stays out drunk all night.

847
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,680
That must be my fault too!

848
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,430
I have corrupted your saintly men!

849
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,350
You didn't have to
sell your wedding necklace...

850
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,100
To save your child from pimps!

851
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,010
It is easy for you to talk!

852
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,430
Truth is...
you have never lived our lives!

853
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,720
Try managing a home, family, and children.

854
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,550
It's not child's play!

855
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,180
<i>Gulab isn't a child anymore Rani!</i>

856
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,510
He came to my tent,
with a bundle of cash...

857
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:40,140
Whore!

858
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,970
<i>Janaki...</i>

859
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,850
Wait.

860
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,680
I slapped <i>Gulab</i> just as hard!

861
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:02,510
Told him to get lost!

862
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,600
I was there when <i>Gulab</i> was born.

863
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,220
I saw him before <i>Rani</i> did.

864
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:19,510
Truth is... I am not from <i>Rani's</i> village.

865
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,640
Nor are we childhood friends.

866
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,180
I first met her years ago.

867
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,680
When I dropped
her very drunk husband home.

868
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:36,640
<i>Shankar</i> was my client.

869
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:44,010
She was a new bride. Barely 14 or 15.

870
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,470
Just a child.

871
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,470
She thanked me for bringing him home.

872
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,890
Even made me stay for dinner.

873
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,510
I was a child too.

874
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:59,720
A child with no friends.

875
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:02,720
We sat up talking till dawn...

876
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,930
I'll never forget that night.

877
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:11,100
Next year when I returned...

878
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,510
I heard that <i>Shankar</i> had died
in an accident.

879
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,180
Year after year...

880
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,680
I made sure I came back to see <i>Rani.</i>

881
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,470
Today there is nobody in my life...

882
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,550
More dear to me than <i>Rani.</i>

883
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,470
There they are!

884
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,470
<i>Rani...</i> Wait!

885
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:47,140
<i>Rani...</i> Don't be stubborn.

886
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,680
Where were you all day?

887
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,930
Answer me!

888
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:02,180
I haven't eaten all day!

889
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,260
You were with <i>Bijli,</i> right?

890
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,390
I'm warning you!

891
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:11,050
Stop meeting that dirty whore!

892
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,050
You can visit that "dirty whore".

893
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,720
But not me?

894
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,140
Open your booze-addled eyes <i>Gulab.</i>

895
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,760
And look at your wife for once.

896
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:25,100
Don't hurry to be a man...

897
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,140
Learn to be human first.

898
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,470
<i>Bijli?</i>

899
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:50,300
Oh. Sorry.

900
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:51,180
Hey <i>Raju...</i>

901
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:52,890
Who's taken my stage?

902
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:54,260
No one.

903
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,180
Tell me! Who's on my stage?

904
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:59,050
Tell me!

905
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,760
<i>Bijli.</i> The boss is furious!

906
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,260
You took off without a word.

907
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,640
And you keep refusing clients!

908
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,300
He said he'd fire me...

909
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,850
For letting you take the bike.

910
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:14,350
He said "Gas doesn't come for free!"

911
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,140
Don't spin yarns.

912
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,600
Just tell me who's on my stage?

913
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,430
She's nothing!

914
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,010
Just a filler...

915
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:25,970
While the crowds wait for you.

916
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:31,680
How do I look?

917
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,220
Nobody compares to you <i>Bijli.</i>

918
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,760
Go. Work it.

919
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,140
Go make the earth quake!

920
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,970
Go!

921
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:04,430
Please stop!

922
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:06,930
Let me shut that mouth of yours!

923
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,850
I want no part in <i>Bijli's</i> crazy plan.

924
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:21,890
It's such a huge risk.

925
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,850
What if someone finds out?

926
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,470
What if your husband finds out?

927
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,140
How will he?

928
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,890
He'll never find out!

929
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:32,300
Of course he will.

930
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:33,720
We won't let him.

931
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,300
These marks of love he leaves on my body...

932
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:41,550
Should I ignore them?

933
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,260
Accept this as my fate?

934
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,800
Just imagine, what if I'm not barren?

935
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,970
Remember what you said?

936
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:57,850
"Life can't be that unfair..."

937
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,050
"We too will find
our share of happiness."

938
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,180
I want my share <i>Rani.</i>

939
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:27,640
<i>Bijli?</i>

940
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,720
Here?

941
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,720
Yes. Here.

942
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,970
Right in the middle of the road.

943
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,760
Duffer chick!

944
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,930
There's a cave behind that hill.

945
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,600
That's where you're going.

946
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:47,850
Hey <i>Rani...</i> I'll be back soon.

947
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,300
Hello?

948
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,970
<i>Rani Kanwar Jaiswal?</i>

949
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,600
Who is this?

950
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:10,800
I'm still <i>Shahrukh Khan.</i>

951
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:12,720
But not the film hero.

952
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:16,010
Just a 42 year old bachelor
called <i>Shahrukh Khan.</i>

953
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:18,550
I have a hearty laugh...

954
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,260
And a long mustache.

955
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,800
You want to hear more?

956
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:26,300
My eyes are sharp but
my joints ache in the winter.

957
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,300
Tell me <i>Rani.</i> Will you meet me?

958
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:32,930
And please don't say...
"What will people say?"

959
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:38,800
But what will people say?

960
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,640
Hey. You're sure you want this?

961
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:50,390
According to my calculations...

962
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:53,720
This is the right time of the month
for you to conceive.

963
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,970
Yes. I'm sure <i>Bijli.</i>

964
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:00,260
Remember the lover I told you about?

965
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:02,470
The one who taught me to dream?

966
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,100
He's the one!

967
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,890
<i>Lajjo...</i>

968
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,600
Don't be afraid.

969
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,260
Go make your village proud!

970
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,100
You know <i>Raju?</i>

971
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:55,220
I think he's falling in love with me.

972
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,930
Your <i>Raju?</i>

973
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:00,350
I've noticed how he looks at you.

974
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,180
Everybody falls in love with our <i>Bijli!</i>

975
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,140
Oh sonfuckers!

976
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:10,300
It's dawn.

977
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,220
Why are you sleeping here?

978
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,140
Did the boss fire you again?

979
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:32,390
<i>Bijli</i> it's morning!

980
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,220
Where were you the whole night?

981
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,430
I called your mobile also...

982
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,970
Aye <i>Raju.</i>

983
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:41,350
Do you know?

984
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,890
You're my most favorite.

985
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:45,850
Quit this shitty life.

986
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,470
And run away!

987
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,680
Go to the city. Get a respectable job.

988
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:54,180
Then find a nice girl,

989
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,760
and love her like crazy.

990
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:30,430
<i>He's sitting in the well...</i>

991
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:39,350
<i>Hiding in the foliage...</i>

992
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:49,220
<i>He's quiet and shy...</i>

993
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,640
<i>O Tortoise...</i>

994
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,680
<i>Come out and play!</i>

995
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:57,470
<i>O Tortoise...</i>

996
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,850
<i>Come out and play!</i>

997
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,600
What the hell are you doing?

998
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,050
Beware <i>Bijli!</i>

999
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,850
The boss said I'm the new queen!

1000
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,390
<i>O Tortoise...</i>

1001
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,140
<i>Come out and play!</i>

1002
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:28,890
<i>O Tortoise...</i>

1003
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,890
<i>Come out and play!</i>

1004
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,010
You're back?

1005
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,260
Pinky is busy. Get lost.

1006
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:41,470
I've brought money asshole!

1007
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,470
Get the fuck out!

1008
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,470
You're not welcome!

1009
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:49,600
Why don't I call Mommy again?

1010
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,390
Get this punk out of here!

1011
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,430
Stay out of this <i>Kishan!</i>

1012
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:56,300
<i>Gulab,</i> let me take you home.

1013
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,800
Stay away!

1014
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,430
Go make your skirts.

1015
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:01,640
I fucking hate you!

1016
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:09,890
<i>I licked him to life...</i>

1017
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,470
<i>I slither... I slide...</i>

1018
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:17,600
<i>I shake him... I sway him...</i>

1019
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,180
<i>But I can't seem to wake him!</i>

1020
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,010
<i>Please rise and shine...</i>

1021
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:30,930
<i>Oh floppy creature of mine...</i>

1022
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,550
<i>Tortoise!</i>

1023
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:41,680
<i>O Tortoise!</i>

1024
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,100
<i>Come out and play!</i>

1025
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:50,390
<i>Glorious Tortoise of mine...</i>

1026
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,640
<i>Rise and shine!</i>

1027
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,390
Who is it?

1028
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,800
I need some talcum powder.

1029
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,180
The boss wants me for a big client.

1030
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,760
You must've been quite hot in your time.

1031
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:53,350
Must have been in demand too!

1032
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:02,850
Goodnight <i>Raju.</i>

1033
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:07,180
What was she doing here?

1034
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,140
She's a cheeky bitch!

1035
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,600
She's perfect for you.

1036
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,720
Go be her slave.

1037
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,220
Make her your ATM machine.

1038
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,890
What are you looking at?

1039
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,390
Your eyes.

1040
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:28,390
Your eyes are beautiful.

1041
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,970
You're hilarious!

1042
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,600
No man ever looks
above <i>Bijli's</i> chest.

1043
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:42,220
And you?

1044
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:43,760
You see my eyes?

1045
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:48,760
Not just your eyes <i>Bijli...</i>

1046
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,430
I see all of you.

1047
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,970
When you dance on stage...

1048
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,300
I feel like...

1049
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:59,100
And when you laugh it's as if...

1050
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,180
And when you tease me...

1051
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:07,680
But when you're angry with me...

1052
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:10,350
I piss in my pants!

1053
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,930
What are you trying to say?

1054
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,850
Nothing... Just...

1055
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:26,390
You should value yourself. That's all.

1056
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,390
Hey!

1057
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,260
Who are you?

1058
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:04,720
What are you doing here?

1059
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:03,800
You'll get your full payment
before the <i>Dussehra</i> festival.

1060
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,890
But no days off after the festival.

1061
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,850
We're getting a huge order!

1062
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,720
<i>Kunkoo</i> here's your bonus.

1063
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,220
Here's my share for the TV.

1064
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,050
We just need 2000 more!

1065
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:21,640
Then we're getting TV!

1066
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:24,930
<i>Rani</i> here's your bonus.

1067
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:29,010
The client is pleased with
your and <i>Janaki's</i> work.

1068
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,350
One more announcement.

1069
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,760
The Handicraft Committee
has awarded <i>Lajjo...</i>

1070
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:37,100
The 'Best Worker' title!

1071
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:41,760
They want to offer you a permanent job.

1072
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:44,390
You'll get a monthly salary...

1073
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,680
And a bonus!

1074
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:47,720
Wow <i>Lajjo!</i>

1075
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:05,510
Lord <i>Krishna</i> has blessed our women.

1076
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:08,600
Last year <i>Kunkoo</i> prayed
to Him and got pregnant.

1077
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,680
So what if it was a girl.

1078
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:17,350
This year <i>Lajjo</i> has been blessed!

1079
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,300
Next year it's <i>Jhumki's</i> turn.

1080
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,640
But she needs more than a miracle.

1081
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:26,720
My son refuses to touch her.

1082
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:29,890
He says she's as skinny as a reed.

1083
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,970
Does he want someone as flabby as him?

1084
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:39,930
I can't understand these men.

1085
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:41,390
They want everything!

1086
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,970
Long hair, doe eyes, voluptuous body.

1087
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,010
<i>Rani...</i> Big boobs!

1088
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,800
Not everyone has big boobs!

1089
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:50,350
Yes <i>Lajjo,</i> you poor thing.

1090
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,600
You have them but still no action!

1091
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,510
<i>Rani!</i>

1092
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,010
She took a big loan for <i>Gulab's</i> wedding.

1093
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,550
Even mortgaged her hut.

1094
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:22,680
I haven't paid interest in 3 months...

1095
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,350
If I can't pay up?

1096
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:25,800
I'll have to sell my hut.

1097
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:28,300
Sell your hut. Come live with me.

1098
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:30,140
I want to meet you.

1099
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,430
Really? You're asking for trouble.

1100
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,180
- I love trouble
- Send me your address.

1101
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,680
I'm coming!

1102
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,050
Just say when.

1103
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,430
I've got to go!

1104
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:44,930
I wouldn't have come back.

1105
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,470
If I saw you happy.

1106
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:49,550
My uncle got me a job in the city.

1107
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,100
It doesn't work this way.

1108
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:52,600
Lets run away. Start afresh!

1109
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:54,140
Please!

1110
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,350
I beg you.

1111
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,470
Hey you!

1112
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:59,550
You have some cheek!

1113
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:02,850
How dare you enter my house?

1114
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,720
I will hand you to the police!

1115
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:07,720
What are you looking at? Get lost!

1116
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:11,680
Before the village folk
beat you to a pulp!

1117
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,510
You'll have the TV
by the <i>Dussehra</i> festival.

1118
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,430
Congratulations!

1119
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:47,300
Oh my... <i>Lajjo!</i>

1120
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:50,050
Look at you...

1121
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:54,100
Glowing like a new bride.

1122
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:59,390
You haven't worn this necklace in ages.

1123
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,260
It's been passed down for generations.

1124
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,970
Grandma wore it on her wedding day.

1125
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:11,550
She passed it to my Ma.

1126
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:15,100
And Ma gave it to my <i>Lajjo...</i>

1127
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,390
At our wedding.

1128
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,800
And you'll give it to...?

1129
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,550
I'm starving.

1130
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:27,350
Serve dinner.

1131
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,800
So much food.

1132
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,930
Have we won the lottery?

1133
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,470
Something like that.

1134
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:59,220
I got a hefty advance from <i>Kishan.</i>

1135
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:01,100
He said...

1136
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:04,390
The Handicrafts Committee loves my work.

1137
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,350
I'll be getting a salary every month.

1138
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,050
A salary! Plus a bonus!

1139
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,510
And there's more news...

1140
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:13,430
I'm two months...

1141
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,550
Get me water!

1142
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:32,180
Why don't you chuck it in my face?

1143
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,720
Make me look like a good for nothing!

1144
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:40,350
Bloody bitch! Do yourself a favor.

1145
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,800
Buy yourself a brain with that bonus!

1146
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,100
<i>Bijli...</i>

1147
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,510
Has the boss found a client for me?

1148
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:09,850
Voilà!

1149
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:13,970
What's this?

1150
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,300
Just an advance.

1151
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:18,930
The rest after the job's done.

1152
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,850
He's a big catch.

1153
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,140
Meet him at the bus stop at 10 o'clock.

1154
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,180
You won't need the boss any more!

1155
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,680
10 o'clock.

1156
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,050
I... <i>Rajesh Rana...</i>

1157
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:26,010
Have mustered up my courage...

1158
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:29,970
And my money...

1159
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:39,890
Let's run away <i>Bijli!</i>

1160
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,430
There's nothing for us here.

1161
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:46,010
The boss can't see beyond the new girl.

1162
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:48,100
He doesn't value you!

1163
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,510
He's itching to throw you out!

1164
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,390
Run away with me.

1165
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,550
We'll go to <i>Delhi.</i>

1166
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,300
I'll handle the business.

1167
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,140
And you'll be my Queen!

1168
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,970
I've arranged everything.

1169
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:05,550
Please say yes.

1170
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:08,760
You and I together... We'll rule <i>Delhi!</i>

1171
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:11,050
Just say yes!

1172
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:18,010
I see...

1173
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,970
You want to be my pimp.

1174
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:29,680
Great!

1175
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:36,470
Done.

1176
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,390
Let's seal the deal!

1177
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:46,550
Right here? In the open?

1178
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,720
Come on!

1179
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,800
You want it under that tree?

1180
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:52,850
Behind the well?

1181
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:55,300
Or we can go back to my tent!

1182
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,760
Come on!

1183
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,050
Isn't this too much for a simple fuck?

1184
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,350
You could have just paid my daily rate!

1185
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:06,100
What kind of pimp will you be?

1186
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:08,680
<i>Ranaji!</i> Save your festival bonus...

1187
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:10,930
For some other whores!

1188
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,260
Why are you doing this?

1189
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,300
I did all this for you!

1190
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,010
<i>Raju</i> proposed to me.

1191
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,720
He asked me to be his Queen.

1192
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:55,390
He wants to be my new pimp.

1193
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,100
The boss is right.

1194
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:12,390
I forgot.

1195
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,890
I am a whore.

1196
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:20,260
And that's what I'll always be.

1197
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:25,050
I really am the scum of society.

1198
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,140
I want a smoke too.

1199
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,600
The village gets TV!

1200
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:22,600
What a momentous day!

1201
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:27,720
This has been possible
only because of <i>Kishan.</i>

1202
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:32,390
The entire village thanks you.

1203
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:41,010
God bless you!

1204
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:08,680
<i>Janaki?</i>

1205
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:10,850
<i>Janaki!</i>

1206
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:12,640
Come here!

1207
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:16,800
How dare you steal my money!

1208
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:19,100
What money Ma?

1209
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,930
Who did you give it to?

1210
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,850
That boy?

1211
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,100
Who is he?

1212
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:26,800
Don't you run from me!

1213
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:31,760
I'm struggling to pay back
the loan for your wedding!

1214
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,970
You know I mortgaged the house for you!

1215
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,680
Still you stole from me?

1216
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:40,430
First <i>Gulab,</i>

1217
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,390
God knows what he's up to!

1218
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:44,050
And now his bride...

1219
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:45,930
Steals from her own home.

1220
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:46,970
<i>Rani?</i>

1221
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:48,050
What's wrong?

1222
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:49,430
Is everything alright?

1223
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,850
Get in!

1224
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:53,350
Why don't you both just kill me!

1225
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,720
Oh come on...

1226
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:02,930
Don't turn us away.

1227
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,850
We've done business before.

1228
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,640
But the new girl's special.

1229
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,220
Fresh on the market.

1230
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,430
Her rate is 1000.

1231
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:12,800
No discount.

1232
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:14,550
Fine.

1233
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:16,600
800 and not a penny more.

1234
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:20,220
A trip to the moon for 800.

1235
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:22,430
You get to ride the rocket.

1236
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:24,050
<i>Bijli!</i>

1237
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,260
Back off!

1238
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,600
He wants the new girl!

1239
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,510
I'll find someone for you.

1240
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:34,180
I've had a change of heart.

1241
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:37,510
I choose the rocket ride with <i>Bijli.</i>

1242
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,890
I'm coming... I'm coming...

1243
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:52,050
With one full month's advance!

1244
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,010
What?

1245
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:03,140
I'll call you back.

1246
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:14,010
Ma can't find her money.

1247
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:15,510
Have you seen it?

1248
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:18,890
Ma can't find her money.

1249
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:20,180
Have you seen it?

1250
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:21,930
Oh so now you can speak also!

1251
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,260
You took the money, didn't you?

1252
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:30,970
You took it, didn't you?

1253
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:34,100
You're calling me a thief?

1254
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,350
You took the money, didn't you?

1255
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,350
What did you say?

1256
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,800
Yes! I took the money!

1257
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,100
You're calling me a thief?

1258
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,180
C'mon! Say it again...

1259
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:54,970
How dare you call me a thief!

1260
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,180
Bloody bitch!

1261
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,890
Go little rocket!

1262
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:02,640
Go! Go! Go!

1263
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,010
Ah! More astronauts!

1264
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:09,100
C'mon! Climb onboard the rocket!

1265
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:16,470
Speed up... 120... 130...

1266
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:18,220
I'll break this bed today!

1267
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,600
Adios amigos... I'm going to the moon!

1268
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,890
Moooooon!!!

1269
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:28,010
Bitch!

1270
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:31,260
<i>Gulab!</i> Get off her!

1271
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,350
This is my house!

1272
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:35,720
Not your brothel!

1273
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,430
Don't try to find me! Ever!

1274
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:53,010
You both disgust me!

1275
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:55,550
May you rot in hell!

1276
01:38:56,390 --> 01:39:00,350
Now I know why my father
left you for a bloody whore!

1277
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:05,220
I want to see!

1278
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:09,010
How you bitches survive without a man!

1279
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,300
It's all my fault.

1280
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,220
That boy was at school with me.

1281
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:42,640
He wanted to marry me.

1282
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:48,600
But his parents couldn't afford my dowry.

1283
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,970
I cut off my hair.

1284
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:58,180
To stop the wedding.

1285
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,850
He rides for hours to see me.

1286
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:11,260
I never called him... Ever!

1287
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:28,720
I didn't steal the money Ma!

1288
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:45,390
<i>Bijli?</i>

1289
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:50,760
Excellent <i>Bijli...</i> Good job!

1290
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,300
What a comeback!

1291
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:55,720
They'll be back next week.

1292
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:58,100
Paid an advance for you.

1293
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,470
Keep your share.

1294
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,890
You beat the new girl!

1295
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,140
Good for you!

1296
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,350
Put your thumb print here.

1297
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:35,470
After deducting the loan amount,

1298
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,720
this is left from the sale of your hut.

1299
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:39,050
Count it.

1300
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,180
Where will you go now?

1301
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,930
Maybe I'll go see my parents...

1302
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:55,390
I never went back after marriage.

1303
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,680
Take it. Take it.

1304
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:08,760
She's smart and loves books.

1305
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:10,680
Enroll her in school.

1306
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:13,800
She's my daughter.

1307
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:17,640
If anything happens to her,
I'll kill you!

1308
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,550
I bought you a mobile.

1309
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,390
To keep in touch.

1310
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:40,800
Ma.

1311
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,890
I will miss you!

1312
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:51,390
I'll come visit you in your new home.

1313
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:01,850
Go on.

1314
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:03,800
God bless you both.

1315
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:38,640
Look, it's that skirtfucker <i>Kishan.</i>

1316
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,140
His game needs to end.

1317
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,890
The New Village Hero!

1318
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,720
Hero soon-to-be zero!

1319
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,800
Motherfucker...

1320
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:16,970
<i>Gulab</i> what are you doing?

1321
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:23,890
You're no hero!

1322
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:27,260
Show him! Bastard!

1323
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:46,220
<i>Today is Dussehra,
a most auspicious day...</i>

1324
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:55,350
<i>A day of transformation... And truth.</i>

1325
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,350
<i>Today Lord Ram decimated
the Demon King Ravan.</i>

1326
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:06,850
<i>Today is Victory day!</i>

1327
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:14,180
Let's go to the temple tonight.

1328
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,970
It's a day of thanks.

1329
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:20,300
And we have much to be grateful for.

1330
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,850
If it's a boy...

1331
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:25,970
We'll name him after Lord <i>Ram.</i>

1332
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:28,930
He too will destroy evil.

1333
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,010
But to tell you the truth...

1334
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:34,800
I want a daughter.

1335
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,640
What are you saying <i>Lajjo?</i>

1336
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:40,140
You're listening?

1337
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:46,470
I'm pregnant.

1338
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,050
What?

1339
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:56,220
I'm pregnant!

1340
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:01,220
I'm pregnant!

1341
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:02,850
Finally!

1342
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:09,760
What's wrong?

1343
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,100
Isn't this what you wanted?

1344
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:17,260
Tell me, who did you fuck?

1345
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:19,430
Whose sin is in your belly?

1346
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:21,890
No one's!

1347
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,890
Who else's would it be?

1348
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:25,350
It's yours!

1349
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,100
My child?

1350
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,050
You think I'm an idiot?

1351
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,300
That you can trick me?

1352
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:32,220
Fucking whore!

1353
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:39,720
Why can't it be yours?

1354
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:47,180
Tell me why it can't be yours?

1355
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:50,470
Hit me all you want...

1356
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:52,510
It won't change a thing...

1357
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,800
This child is yours and yours alone!

1358
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:01,180
IT CAN'T BE MINE!

1359
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:03,390
Because you're a whore!

1360
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:05,390
A dirty whore!

1361
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:07,890
I may be a whore...

1362
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,300
But I am not barren!

1363
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:15,050
<i>Naobi!</i>

1364
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:17,010
<i>Kishan?</i>

1365
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:17,970
What happened?

1366
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:20,180
He's lying half-dead in the hospital.

1367
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:22,640
We can't live here anymore.
We're leaving!

1368
01:47:22,930 --> 01:47:25,930
If fate allows, we'll meet again.

1369
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:37,220
<i>Today we celebrate
the Divine power of the Feminine.</i>

1370
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:41,600
<i>Today Goddess Durga decimated
the great demon Mahisur.</i>

1371
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:50,720
Listen...

1372
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:55,680
Accept this child as your own <i>Manoj.</i>

1373
01:47:58,260 --> 01:47:59,930
You've always wanted a child.

1374
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:05,680
This is your chance!

1375
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:20,100
Fine. Go tell the Elders...

1376
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:23,350
Announce to the whole village...

1377
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:24,930
That your wife is a whore!

1378
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:28,260
She slept with another man...

1379
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:30,390
And that's how she got pregnant.

1380
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:33,970
Because you couldn't do it!

1381
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,180
Because YOU are the barren one!

1382
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,220
<i>Lajjo!...</i> Open the door!

1383
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,510
<i>Lajjo!</i>

1384
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,890
Let go of her! Bastard!

1385
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:12,220
<i>As Lord Ram's arrow
pierced Ravan's navel...</i>

1386
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,430
<i>The Demon King burst into flames!</i>

1387
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:18,890
<i>Lajjo!</i> Help!

1388
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:26,010
<i>Good won over Evil.</i>

1389
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:30,890
<i>Truth defeated Deceit.</i>

1390
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,390
<i>Today we cleanse our lives.</i>

1391
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,720
<i>Today we rise above our fears.</i>

1392
01:49:57,180 --> 01:50:00,640
<i>Today we let the Light enter.</i>

1393
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:04,390
<i>Today we leave darkness behind.</i>

1394
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,350
<i>Bijli!</i>

1395
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:12,260
What's wrong?

1396
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,600
It's burnt.

1397
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:12,510
I feel like I have to go all the time.

1398
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,890
Like there's a well inside me.

1399
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,050
<i>Bijli...</i>

1400
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:33,470
I've never seen you like this.

1401
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,600
Will you really run away with us?

1402
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:44,100
Leave everything behind?

1403
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:49,430
You've done so much for us.

1404
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:55,260
You have no idea what
you both have done for me.

1405
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:02,800
I've heard many
promises over the years...

1406
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:06,390
But no one came through.

1407
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:09,970
You did. You set <i>Bijli</i> free!

1408
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,760
Look <i>Rani.</i>

1409
01:52:28,470 --> 01:52:29,600
Your hair is burnt.

1410
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:33,390
<i>Rani's</i> hair is burnt!

1411
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:36,550
Hey <i>Rani...</i>

1412
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:38,720
Imagine... What will people say?

1413
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:41,350
<i>Rani</i> will have to
cut her hair like <i>Janaki.</i>

1414
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,220
Quiet! You duffers.

1415
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:53,180
Where should we go?

1416
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,600
<i>Mumbai!</i>

1417
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,470
Oh no... Not <i>Mumbai!</i>

1418
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,890
Why not?

1419
01:52:58,350 --> 01:53:00,930
I want my child to have
a childhood like mine.

1420
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,680
She'll dance in the fields...

1421
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,010
Bathe in the river...

1422
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:06,180
Catch butterflies in the Spring...

1423
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:09,430
And who will earn the money?
Your father?

1424
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:12,140
There are no men now. Just us.

1425
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:15,140
<i>Kishan</i> has shown
us that we can survive!

1426
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,050
Skillful sewing...
beats skillful screwing!

1427
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:25,800
<i>Rani</i> your phone's ringing!

1428
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:27,600
It's <i>Shahrukh Khan!</i>

1429
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:30,600
<i>Rani...</i> Answer it.

1430
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:31,970
Ask him...

1431
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,220
Should we go left or right?

1432
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:44,680
<i>Rani?</i> Where are you my love?

1433
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:46,390
At a crossroad...

1434
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,720
Wondering whether to go left or right.

1435
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:50,640
So what will it be?

1436
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:52,140
From now on...

1437
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:54,470
I'll let my heart decide.
