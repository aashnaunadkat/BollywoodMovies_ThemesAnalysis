2
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,291
Kumar... Kumar... chill out, bro.

3
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,958
Everything is on schedule.

4
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,166
All the girls have been selected.

5
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,916
I'll see you next week
with all the details.

6
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,916
For now... we're working
on the presentation.

7
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,833
Till then just chill out
on your yacht, bro.

8
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,958
Okay, see you.

9
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,333
You know who that was?

10
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,375
Where are Kumar's Calendar Girls?

11
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,125
We're just waiting for
your instructions, sir.

12
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,833
Well, then this is the instruction.

13
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:30,708
Call them.

14
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,458
I want all of them in Mumbai.

15
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,125
Tell them to take the
next flight out, alright?

16
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:40,666
Come on, this is Showtime!

17
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,416
This is homemade pickle...

18
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,166
and clarified butter.
Don't forget to eat them.

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,250
I wonder what they will serve
you in the name of food?

20
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,125
And... I'm packing this photo
of Lord Hanuman as well.

21
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,125
Just because you're a model now..

22
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,583
..doesn't mean you stop
fasting on Tuesdays.

23
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,583
- Okay.
- Hello, Mr. Mehta. How are you?

24
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,583
Mr. Mehta, my daughter Mayuri...

25
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,333
- is flying to Mumbai tomorrow.
- Oh my God...

26
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,541
Yes, yes, yes...

27
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,375
She's flying out to be a Calendar Girl.

28
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,291
- Yes... yes...
- Economy.

29
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,375
Mr. Mehta, you're posted at the airport.

30
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,833
And my daughter's ticket's been
confirmed in the Economy class.

31
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,541
And... I was wondering if it could
be upgraded to Business Class..

32
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,208
..it will be really nice... I mean...
if you can do it...

33
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,375
That's was all, Mr. Mehta.

34
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,458
Yes... yes...

35
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:28,708
- Thank you.
- Thank you... thank you very much, sir.

36
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,625
- Our daughter's been promoted to Business Class.
- Very good.

37
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,250
She's got a strong luck.

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,708
After all she's my daughter...

39
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,208
Always takes a long jump.

40
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,791
- She will make it really big.
- Papa...

41
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,000
Just wait and watch...

42
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,875
Soon Mayuri will be Rohtak Queen.

43
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,458
Wow... wonderful.

44
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,458
- Let's take a selfie.
- Yes, please.

45
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:49,708
This...

46
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,041
You're going to trot in
front of the entire world..

47
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,750
..in such skimpy clothes.

48
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,708
Disgusting!

49
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:55,666
This is the result of pampering her...

50
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:56,916
Calling her 'beautiful' all the time.

51
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,541
Now she's going to put
her beauty on display..

52
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,000
..and the world's going to ogle.

53
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,583
How do you know, brother?

54
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,583
Did you ogle at these beautiful girls too?

55
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:04,708
You...

56
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,541
Father, go inside.

57
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,375
- I will talk to her.
- I don't want to talk about anything.

58
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,958
Only five have been selected.

59
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,791
This is not some ordinary job.

60
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,666
- I've decided... I want to go.
- Fine. Go!

61
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,791
But don't ever come back.

62
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,208
I won't, father.

63
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,250
But one day... I will invite
all of you to Mumbai.

64
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,166
You will feel proud of your Paroma.

65
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,791
Just wait and watch.

66
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,791
- Paroma! Paroma!
- Mom!

67
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,625
Congrats, Sharda.

68
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,708
By becoming the youngest Vice-President..

69
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,208
..of such a big company, you
even outdid your mom and dad.

70
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,958
Thank you so much, Jayshri Aunty.

71
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,791
- I hope I did the family proud.
- Yes.

72
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,833
I don't see Nandita around.

73
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,833
Nandita... There she is.

74
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,583
- Hello, Nandi dear.
- Hello, aunty.

75
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,041
Being born in a family of over-achievers..

76
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,666
..has its own side-effects, right dear?

77
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,375
Mom-Dad... CEO..

78
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,541
And your big sister broke all records.

79
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:15,333
Now everyone wants to know about
your plans for the future.

80
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:20,041
- I've been selected as well, aunty.
- WOW!

81
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,208
IBM or Infosys?

82
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,625
Calendar!

83
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,833
- Calendar?
- Yeah!

84
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,000
Which bank? Dhanlaxmi?

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,416
Those calendars are only
good for showing dates.

86
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,125
I am talking about the
hottest Calendar in India.

87
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:40,041
- Are you serious?
- I know it sounds a bit strange..

88
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,500
..but trust me...

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,458
When this Calendar comes
out, I'll be everywhere.

90
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,333
And anyway, every company has CEOs and VPs.

91
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:54,541
But you see Priyanka and Deepika
on the hoardings promoting them.

92
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,541
Right, aunty?

93
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,958
Naazneen, you've made a lot of
progress from Lahore to London.

94
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,500
So what is this obsession about...

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,333
..going to Mumbai and
becoming a Calendar girl.

96
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,708
Inzamam, I haven't achieved
anything big in life yet.

97
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,083
I still have many more
heights of success to scale.

98
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,333
And Calendar girl can be means..

99
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,541
- To get into Bollywood.
- No!

100
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,541
I don't want you to get into Bollywood.

101
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:28,875
You can do whatever you
want right here in London.

102
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,583
Not possible, Inzamam.

103
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,041
This is a huge platform..

104
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,541
..and I cannot miss this opportunity.

105
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,250
This means you'll leave me.

106
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,250
Did you forget the day... I brought you
here from those lanes of Pakistan?

107
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,333
Why don't you come along too?

108
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,791
Don't be crazy. I don't
want to go to India.

109
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,375
I can't stay here either.

110
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,916
Inzamam, I've decided
that I am going to India.

111
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,666
Naazneen!

112
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:50,708
Naazneen!

113
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,083
What kind of a joke is this?

114
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,916
I guess you've made up your mind..

115
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,416
..to give bread-n-breakfast
service to the men in India.

116
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,500
I had my doubts earlier.
But now it's confirmed.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,500
You know what...

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,500
You're going to become a bloody cheapo.

119
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,708
You...

120
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,916
Sharon, you've been selected
for Calendar girls..

121
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,500
..but, are you sure you want to do this?

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,208
Janvi, you sound like I'm going to Iraq.

123
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,833
I've heard a lot about that industry.

124
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,291
There are no rules.

125
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,000
Booze, drugs, sex... orgies!

126
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,541
I really hope so.

127
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,375
By the way, that's what the
world thinks about our Goa.

128
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,625
Like... college girls
walk around in bikinis.

129
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,250
And booze and babes are
easily available here..

130
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,333
..like eggs and toast. Is it true?

131
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,291
- No.
- Exactly!

132
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,708
You know, only one thing matters for me.

133
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,708
And that's a good experience.

134
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,291
When I show these Calendar
photos to my grandchildren..

135
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,416
..even they will think how
hot their grandma was.

136
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,500
- Sharon, you're crazy.
- Not crazy, I am completely sorted.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Keep walking... and I'm gonna run.

138
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,916
You know I really don't understand
what you people keep doing.

139
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,750
Behave like absolute dolts.

140
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,958
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes!

141
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:21,708
Timmy's here.

142
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,333
- Kumar.
- Timmy, my man.

143
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:25,791
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

144
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:26,500
Very well.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,583
- All okay?
- Absolutely.

146
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:28,541
- Come, come, come. Sit.
- Thanks.

147
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,500
- Guys, setup.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,625
So... what's up?

149
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,791
Timmy... this has been our joint
venture for the last 15 years.

150
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,500
15 years!

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,583
You know... I have many businesses.

152
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,166
But no other business gives
me as much kick as this one..

153
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,958
..because this is not a business.

154
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,333
This is my passion, my friend.

155
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,083
Look at the calendar.

156
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,958
It's a Hit!

157
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,375
Earlier only the high-society
would wait for it.

158
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,416
- Today all of India waits for it, you know why?
- Why?

159
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,750
Because this Calendar has become
a symbol for all of India.

160
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,750
It's the symbol of
success, of aspirations..

161
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,375
Achievement... Power!

162
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,375
This year I've even doubled the copies.

163
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,750
Oh really. Wow!

164
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,875
- Tell me what's in-store.
- Right away.

165
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,083
Slides please.

166
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,625
So here are your Calendar girls.

167
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,666
First one is Paroma Ghosh.

168
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,166
- Bong Bomb!
- Stunning.

169
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,791
Naazneen Malik. Lahore, Pakistan.

170
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,333
Cute, huh!

171
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:32,083
And this is Nandita Menon, from Bangalore.

172
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,791
This one is Sharon Pinto.

173
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,166
Sassy lass from Goa.

174
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,833
And last but not the least.

175
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,000
- Mayuri Chauhan.
- Oh my, God.

176
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,833
Small town girl, Rohtak.

177
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,500
But big value.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,666
Thank you.

179
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,666
- So?
- Superb. Superb!

180
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,916
Where do you get these girls from?

181
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not going to tell you my secret?

182
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,333
So tell me... what's the destination?

183
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,125
Where do you intend to shoot this year?

184
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,750
You know I'm thinking...

185
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,458
White Sands... Blue Seas...

186
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:10,500
Mauritius!

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,666
Superb. I am very-very-very happy.

188
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,791
- This is brilliant.
- Thank you.

189
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,041
"Ah... Aah... Ohh... We're on a roll."

190
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,041
"Ah... Aah... Ohh... We're on a roll."

191
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,250
"Ah... Aah... Ohh... We're on a roll."

192
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,416
"Ah... Aah... Ohh... We're on a roll."

193
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,750
"This is the moment to fulfill our dreams."

194
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,000
"Fate has bestowed this opportunity."

195
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,083
"This is the moment to fulfill our dreams."

196
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,333
"Fate has bestowed this opportunity."

197
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,000
"We won't miss this chance."

198
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
"We're gonna pluck the stars."

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,041
"And go beyond the skies."

200
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,708
"We will rock the world."

201
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,500
"It's our intentions."

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,041
"And a promise made to ourselves."

203
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,583
"We're going to show them all."

204
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,583
"We will rock the world."

205
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,916
"We will rock the world."

206
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,875
"Ah... Aah... Ohh... We're on a roll."

207
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,708
"Ah... Aah... Ohh... We're on a roll."

208
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,875
"The pace... is increasing.."

209
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:27,291
"We're spreading our wings."

210
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,500
"And we won't stop for anything."

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,833
"The pace... is increasing.."

212
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:40,083
"We're spreading our wings."

213
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,750
"And we won't stop for anything."

214
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,250
"We won't miss this chance."

215
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,333
"We're gonna pluck the stars."

216
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,750
"And travel beyond the skies."

217
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,500
"We will rock the world."

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,916
"It's our intentions."

219
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,583
"And we made a promise."

220
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,166
"We're going to show them all."

221
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,166
"We will rock the world."

222
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:16,416
"Feet on the ground...
but eyes on the sky."

223
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:23,041
"Our paths unfold beyond the stars."

224
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:29,291
"Feet on the ground...
but eyes on the sky."

225
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:36,500
"Our paths unfold beyond the stars."

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,833
"When we tread on... the world stopped."

227
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,250
"Now that the heart's filled with bless..."

228
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,083
"there's no place for sorrows."

229
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,083
"We won't miss this chance."

230
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,541
"We're gonna pluck the stars."

231
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,208
"And travel beyond the skies."

232
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,875
"We will rock the world."

233
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,416
"It's our intentions."

234
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,041
"And we made a promise."

235
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,541
"We're going to show them all."

236
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,541
"We will rock the world."

237
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,416
"We will rock the world."

238
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:16,333
Girls, welcome to Constance
Le Prince Maurice.

239
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,000
So girls... we start
shooting from tomorrow.

240
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,916
But before that... all of you
must do something for me.

241
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:34,250
Something that every Calendar girl..

242
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,250
..has to do one night before the shoot.

243
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,583
So I want all of you to one by one...

244
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:55,250
Blend in... with me and yourselves.

245
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,166
Come on, girls, lighten up.

246
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,500
Shed your inhibitions.

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,041
So what we'll do is..

248
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:07,833
..all of you will share some dark
and deep secret about yourself.

249
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:08,666
Okay?

250
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:09,416
Okay.

251
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,583
And yes... be brutally honest.

252
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:12,750
Alright.

253
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,416
So who do we start with

254
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,208
Sharon, let's start with you.

255
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:26,500
Tell me... when did you first feel a man?

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,916
I was 15.

257
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,000
What?

258
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,833
I was in school... but
he wasn't in my school.

259
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
He was my neighbor.

260
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,916
And he was a sailor.

261
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,958
I had this fantasy.

262
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,500
To give that epic Titanic
pose like Kate Winslet..

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,041
..with my Leonardo Dicaprio.

264
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,708
But there was only one problem?

265
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:51,458
What?

266
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,083
He only knew how to pose...
but no positions.

267
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,666
He turned out to be a two minutes noodle.

268
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,833
What?

269
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:02,875
Good.

270
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,750
- Thank you, Sharon.
- Yeah.

271
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,500
- Nandita.
- Yeah.

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,458
Tell us.

273
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,375
My first relation... was with a female.

274
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,416
Jenny.

275
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,500
We were both 17.

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,500
Same school, same class.

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,416
She would come over sometimes
for combined studies.

278
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,458
That day we were studying History.

279
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,375
The battle of Panipat.

280
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,000
It was a really boring chapter,
so we took a five minute break.

281
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,458
And trust me guys, those five minutes..

282
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,875
..was much more interesting
than the battle of Panipat.

283
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,375
But hello... it was just an experiment.

284
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,500
It doesn't mean that I am not straight.

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,083
I am... straight!

286
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,666
Interesting! Interesting!

287
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:56,458
Paroma... say... something.

288
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,541
- I had just one relation.
- Okay.

289
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,541
And it was quite a serious one.

290
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,625
Pinaki Chatterjee.

291
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,708
We met every day in Kolkata.

292
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,708
I loved him a lot.

293
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,416
He did too... maybe.

294
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,416
Then... he wanted to build his career.

295
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,291
He wanted to leave Kolkata
and go to Mumbai.

296
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,791
He wanted to go and I let him.

297
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,041
He was very ambitions... which I liked.

298
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:30,333
He's the only guy I had
physical relation with.

299
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,541
After that... not in touch.

300
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,250
Sad, but... it happens.

301
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,375
Right?

302
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,000
Naazneen, tell us something about yourself.

303
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,750
Inzamam, my boyfriend.

304
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,083
I mean ex-boyfriend.

305
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,708
And the only man I was closest too.

306
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,708
He taught me everything.

307
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,916
My relation with Inzamam
was quite passionate.

308
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,000
You know... we would
have these wild fights..

309
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,458
..but we also make love like the wild.

310
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,375
I don't want to brag..

311
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,958
..but I assure you that
I can please any man.

312
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,500
Nice... I like the confidence.

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,291
Mayuri... now tell us something..

314
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:23,875
..that's sexier, darker and more
attractive than all their confessions.

315
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,208
To be very honest...

316
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,500
- I am a virgin.
- What?

317
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,291
Yeah, right.

318
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,833
Come on.

319
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,750
But you know what... even
I've been a little naughty.

320
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,291
- Oh really.
- Yes.

321
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,333
Like...

322
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,791
I had a boyfriend in Rohtak.

323
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,333
Guddu!

324
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,500
Guddu?

325
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,375
His father owned a barn.

326
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:52,458
So one day he took me to
his barn, to kiss me.

327
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,875
And we even kissed for a while.

328
00:17:55,375 --> 00:18:02,041
But you know... the smell of dung, and
the cattle were making such a racket.

329
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,250
- We couldn't get any further.
- What's wrong?

330
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,583
- Mayuri... wait...
- And I scurried off.

331
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,500
It's not that great.

332
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,166
But guys, well done.

333
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,416
- Thank you so much for sharing.
- Thank you. Thank you.

334
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:21,500
And by the way, this is all the
'blending-in' I wanted you guys to do.

335
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,416
So chill.

336
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,666
On a more serious note..

337
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,166
..I want tomorrow's photo-shoot to be..

338
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:33,083
..the most glamorous, sexiest
and most thrilling..

339
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,583
- ..calendar shoot of all time.
- Yes!

340
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,083
In short... the best calendar ever shot.

341
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,583
- Are you girls game?
- Yes.

342
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,458
That's the spirit, now let's go.

343
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,458
- Cheer!
- Cheers!

344
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,250
"There's water... there're wave.."

345
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,541
"And everyone's on a rave."

346
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:19,625
"This is the ultimate
destination to party."

347
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,375
"There's water... there're wave.."

348
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,166
"And everyone's on a rave."

349
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,541
"This is the ultimate
destination to party."

350
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,458
"There's glamour... there're babes."

351
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,291
"And everyone's on a rave."

352
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,666
"This is the ultimate
destination to party."

353
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,791
"Dance... Dance... baby dance along."

354
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,791
"On the party... party... party song."

355
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,500
"Dance... Dance... baby dance along."

356
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,875
"On the party... party... party song."

357
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,500
"Awesome my sweetheart."

358
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,041
"Awesome my sweetheart."

359
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,500
"Tripping little higher."

360
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,125
"Awesome my sweetheart."

361
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,541
"Awesome my sweetheart."

362
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,208
"Awesome my sweetheart."

363
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,833
"Tripping little higher."

364
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,833
"Awesome my sweetheart."

365
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,333
"Everyone's talking about us."

366
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,875
"They're mesmerized by the beautiful body."

367
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,333
"My delicate attitude... is conveying."

368
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,541
"It's flowing like the waves."

369
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:44,666
"There's glittering sand
under my bare feet."

370
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:51,833
"This is the ultimate
destination to party."

371
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,375
"There's glittering sand
under my bare feet."

372
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,958
"This is the ultimate
destination to party."

373
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,666
"There's glamour... there're babes."

374
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,458
"And everyone's on a rave."

375
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,833
"This is the ultimate
destination to party."

376
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,166
"Dance... Dance... baby dance along."

377
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,083
"On the party... party... party song."

378
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,083
"Dance... Dance... baby dance along."

379
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,166
"On the party... party... party song."

380
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,625
"Awesome my sweetheart."

381
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,166
"Awesome my sweetheart."

382
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,791
"Tripping little higher."

383
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,333
"Awesome my sweetheart."

384
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,041
"Awesome my sweetheart."

385
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,416
"Awesome my sweetheart."

386
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,291
"Tripping little higher."

387
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,291
"Awesome my sweetheart."

388
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,458
Oh, my God! It's going to be rocking.

389
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,500
I am so excited.

390
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,375
Do you have any clue how many
people are going to attend..

391
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:01,750
..tomorrow launch party?

392
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,291
I am going to be full on networking.

393
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,333
I'm glad I achieved something.

394
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:10,958
There was tremendous pressure, you know.

395
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,750
After all, not everyone has a
family background like me.

396
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,375
Touchwood.

397
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,750
I'm happy that I did something different.

398
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,166
It's been such a different experience.

399
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah!

400
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,375
Hey girls, dresses are here.

401
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,208
Which dress you want to pick, darling?

402
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,916
- Red!
- Red!

403
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,166
I'm going to get that one.

404
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,500
- What the heck?
- Thank you.

405
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,875
She's such a jerk.

406
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,000
Chill out, you know how Mayuri is.

407
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,625
And anyway, everyone
gets what they deserve.

408
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,166
Come, let's pick you a nice dress.

409
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,166
- Come on.
- Whatever.

410
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,958
Yeah. Naaz... once our
calendar is launched.

411
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:56,291
And my father and brother watch me..

412
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:03,291
..sharing screen space on television
same as the Bollywood stars..

413
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:09,333
..they will know... what
big achievements mean.

414
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:14,208
And I am scared that this
might blow out of proportion.

415
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:19,750
And people might put a ban on me in
Pakistan after watching my bikini pics.

416
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:25,208
By the way... I must
admit, you're quite bold.

417
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:29,500
I didn't know Pakistani girls
could do such a thing.

418
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,291
Why?

419
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:35,250
Pakistani girls can be as
bold as any other girl.

420
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,583
Sometimes bolder.

421
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,541
- Yes.
- Yes!

422
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,000
I now request Mr. Kumar and Mr. Timmy..

423
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,000
..to unveil the calendar 2014.

424
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,375
Wow!

425
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,333
- Oh my, God!
- Wow!

426
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,666
- I love it.
- Wow!

427
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:08,916
- Amazing.
- Awesome, isn't it.

428
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,583
Oh my, God.

429
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,333
Paroma, you just killed it.

430
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,791
Best picture.

431
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,166
That's you.

432
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,541
Oh my, God!

433
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,166
Nandita.

434
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,791
"Whilst treading down the path.."

435
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:37,500
"I never imagined that
destiny would smile on me."

436
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,958
"Where has my desires brought me?"

437
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:44,750
"It's a deluge of happiness."

438
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:51,708
"All my wishes have come true."

439
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,625
"Where has my desires brought me?"

440
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,000
- I was saying..
- Just imagine this.

441
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,291
Girls, our lives are going
to change from tomorrow.

442
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,208
Oh yes. Of course.

443
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,791
A beautiful adventure is
waiting for us tomorrow.

444
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:10,708
Cheers!

445
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,166
Picture.

446
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:16,166
Guys, picture.

447
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,458
Paroma Ghosh.

448
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:46,625
Pinaki!

449
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,625
This is like magic.

450
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,541
You here... like this.

451
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,458
I am shocked.

452
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:57,750
You're shocked... and I am happy.

453
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,375
I've seen many marquees
like these in Kolkata.

454
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,625
But I am here to see you.

455
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,750
I knew you were here.

456
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:10,125
And not just as Paroma, but
as Paroma chief guest.

457
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,833
By the way, you've lost lot of weight.

458
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:17,166
I see... you mean to say I
was over-weight in Kolkata.

459
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,541
You never said to me in Kolkata.

460
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,250
If I had, then my plans to..

461
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,791
..go out on a date with you
every night would've failed.

462
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,625
I must admit, Paroma.

463
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,833
You came all the way here from
Kolkata, against everyone's wishes.

464
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,166
And became the Calendar girl.

465
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,250
It's a big achievement.

466
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,041
Anyway, enough about me.

467
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,916
- Tell me something about yourself.
- Ask.

468
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:44,333
So what are you doing in Mumbai?

469
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,583
Fine, not bad.

470
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,041
Mumbai's been good to me.

471
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,333
I'm working for a Event Management company.

472
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,166
And also handle some cricketers, so..

473
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:52,666
Yeah, Mumbai's been good.

474
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,583
Wow... cricketers.

475
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,416
I should've guessed.

476
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,208
You were always ambitious
from the beginning.

477
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:00,666
Thank you.

478
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:04,208
So... I guess now you
have everything, Pinaki.

479
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:09,458
Money, cars, bungalow... girlfriends.

480
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,916
That's the only thing I don't have.

481
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,958
Why? Couldn't find the time?

482
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:20,916
- Couldn't find the right girl.
- Ohh, I see.

483
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,625
Enough about me, let's talk about you.

484
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,458
A beautiful girl like you...
all alone in this place.

485
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:28,291
What's the matter?

486
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,833
Where's your boyfriend? Are
you hiding him at your home?

487
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,541
I am still single.

488
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:37,083
I've a busy schedule and need to focus.

489
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,666
Okay.

490
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,208
- Anyway... I need to go.
- Okay.

491
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,875
- I'll help you.
- Yeah.

492
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:47,500
- Paroma, it was really nice meeting you.
- Me too.

493
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,416
- We must keep in touch.
- You too.

494
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,125
Take care.

495
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,500
There's one thing I forgot to tell you.

496
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,500
Puchka's called Panipuri in Mumbai.

497
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:05,166
Go!

498
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,791
- Wow, that's superb, Bob.
- Thanks, Sharon.

499
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,750
Rocking shoot.

500
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,583
- Anirudh, hi.
- Hey, Sharon.

501
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,000
How is it going?

502
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
You're looking gorgeous.

503
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,458
- Thanks to you. You got me this really nice Ad.
- Really?

504
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,541
And you're impressed with this?

505
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,541
Trust me, this is just the beginning.

506
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:47,416
Thanks.

507
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:48,833
I'll go change.

508
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,291
- Let's catch up.
- Sure.

509
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,083
I am very happy and privileged..

510
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,250
..that you chose my company TalentLap..

511
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,500
..to look after your jobs.

512
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,916
Just wait and watch...

513
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,458
Endorsements... Fashion Shows...
Photo Shoots..

514
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:01,916
Magazine Covers...

515
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:05,166
You name it and I'll line it up for you.

516
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:06,750
What happened? Why are you smiling?

517
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,500
You know the only thing
that matters to me..

518
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,083
..is good and interesting work.

519
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,666
I just want to do something
nice and unique.

520
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,500
That being said... I'm very happy..

521
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
..that your agency will handle my jobs.

522
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,333
Beauty with brains, huh.

523
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,041
I must say you're a very sorted girl...
and I like that.

524
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,000
Thanks.

525
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,125
Let me show you what I've lined up for you.

526
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:30,583
It's okay, Anirudh. I trust you.

527
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,916
Fine, then... I guess it's a great start.

528
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,500
I'll tell you what, let's
go out and celebrate.

529
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,916
Come on.

530
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:39,458
Not tonight, please.

531
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:40,666
I am very tired.

532
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:45,791
Sharon, in our industry...
getting tired is banned.

533
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,666
You see... it's a simple rule.

534
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,083
If you don't party, you won't be seen.

535
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,958
And if people don't see you enough..

536
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,125
..then how will you sell
your beautiful face?

537
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:55,916
Huh!

538
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,000
So come on.

539
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,208
Trust me, I would have..

540
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,541
..but it's just that I've an
early morning shoot tomorrow.

541
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,041
Next time, it's a deal.

542
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,375
Next time when we meet.

543
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,333
We're going to party like
there's no tomorrow.

544
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:07,208
Done.

545
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:08,333
- Deal.
- Deal.

546
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:12,333
- See you sweetheart.
- See you.

547
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:30,416
So Naazneen... did you trot
your body around in India?

548
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:35,708
By the way... I am sure your Calendar
shoot had a really low budget.

549
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,916
That's why you were wearing
those beautiful two-piece.

550
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,166
I am sure you didn't have the sense..

551
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:44,500
- ..of what to show and what to hide?
- Inzamam, stop it.

552
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,875
- For God's sake, shut up.
- Don't you dare utter the word God.

553
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,750
What you did is forbidden amongst us.

554
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,208
You will rot in hell, you cheap woman.

555
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:58,208
- Inzamam.
- Don't you dare take my name.

556
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,708
You shot for the Calender, what now?

557
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,000
Will you do Po** next?

558
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,041
I'll do Bollywood films.
I am getting offers.

559
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:08,375
Yeah... now you'll be sleeping around
with those infidels in Bollywood.

560
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:12,375
Inzamam!

561
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:27,625
Look, Mayuri, first impression
is the only impression.

562
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,416
- Mr. Tiwari... your English is so weak.
- Why? What's wrong?

563
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,125
- First impression... Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

564
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,541
- First impression is the last impression.
- Yes.

565
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,958
It's alright. But it's your
first day of shooting today.

566
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:40,958
So start impressing everyone from today.

567
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:44,083
Don't worry, Mr. Tiwari, I'll handle it.

568
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,000
You just see.

569
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,583
Bobby will get down from the
train, then Mayuri enters..

570
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,625
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

571
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:51,625
Good morning, ma'am.

572
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,333
Sir, my dreams have come true today.

573
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,708
My first film, and with you.

574
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,708
Nice...

575
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,833
Sir, I've been really lucky for
everyone since I was a kid.

576
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,500
And our film will be a big hit.

577
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,958
- Just wait and see..
- Okay.

578
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,333
- Just give me your blessings.
- Okay, okay.

579
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:08,708
Mayuri, I want the same expression..

580
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,666
..you gave at the time
of the audition, okay?

581
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,958
Bobby, hurry up.

582
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,541
Or else... we'll miss
the train of our life.

583
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:17,916
This one, right sir?

584
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,166
- Okay. Okay.
- Sir.. - Later.

585
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,500
Thank you.

586
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,541
By the way, Ricky... nice shirt.

587
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,250
Thank you, ma'am.

588
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,458
Give him a cutter someone.

589
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,000
Hello, Venkat sir.

590
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,708
- How am I looking?
- Nice... really nice.

591
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,083
Sir, please tell me my best angle.

592
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,041
- So that I look my best in the movie.
- Sure, sure, sure.

593
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,625
- Yeah. Deal.
- Thank you, sir.

594
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,875
- Did you have breakfast?
- No, not yet.

595
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,916
Don't worry, I brought
homemade stuffed bread.

596
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,208
We'll eat together.

597
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:48,166
- Okay?
- Okay.

598
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,250
- Sure?
- Yeah!

599
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,041
See you, sir.

600
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:53,791
- Sir... sir..
- And you approach from the front.

601
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,083
- Our film is trending on Twitter.
- What?

602
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,291
When lots of people discuss
or tweet about a topic..

603
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:00,375
..then it starts trending.

604
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,291
Look, sir. Everyone's talking
about our film, sir.

605
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,083
Everyone.

606
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,541
But how did this happen?

607
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:07,166
All thanks to Mayuri.

608
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,291
She has 500,000 fans on Twitter.

609
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,000
And ma'am tweeted five times
about this film since morning.

610
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,000
Sir, her followers are already talking.

611
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,458
And this film is trending.

612
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,500
Just watch... this girl will make it big.

613
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,500
Yes, sir.

614
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:29,166
The audition was difficult,
but you did a great job.

615
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:31,500
In fact, our director is really impressed.

616
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,958
- Really?
- Yes.

617
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,708
And Nazneen, now you're doing
this role in the film.

618
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,958
Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.

619
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:42,666
Nazneen, I want to start shooting
this film as soon as possible.

620
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,208
And so I've a start to finish
schedule for this film.

621
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:49,333
All the shoots are in Mumbai,
and you will enjoy it.

622
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:52,708
But Nazneen, I hope you don't
have any travel plans.

623
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,708
Not at all, sir. I came to Mumbai to work.

624
00:33:56,208 --> 00:34:00,208
Nice... that's nice.

625
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:05,875
And this is your signing amount.

626
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,666
Thank you so much, sir.

627
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,666
- Looking forward to..
- Thank you so much.

628
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:18,666
Seriously.

629
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,125
Nandita, finally it's so good to meet you.

630
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,500
And trust me when I say that..

631
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,041
..out of the five Calendar
girls, you are my favorite.

632
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:26,541
That's so sweet.

633
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:27,916
So what's next? Bollywood?

634
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,666
Let's see, I'm getting few offers.

635
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:30,875
- Let's see when it happens.
- Great.

636
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:34,833
- Hi, Naina.
- Harsh Narang, lovely.

637
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,916
- How happy am I to see you?
- Same here.

638
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,000
Let me introduce you to the
very gorgeous Nandita Menon.

639
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,750
- Hi.
- Calendar Girl.Hello.

640
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,250
And of course, this handsome young man..

641
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,000
..I don't think I need to
say too much about him.

642
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,333
Of course you don't need to.

643
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,125
I have met him a couple of times.

644
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,208
- Really?
- On television and newspapers.

645
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,166
And recently I saw him on
Business India Magazine.

646
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,458
He's on the top 50 entrepreneurs of India.

647
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:56,583
I am impressed.

648
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,791
I didn't know models are so up to date.

649
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,708
I mean about the world of business.

650
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,625
I'm glad I changed your opinion.

651
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,083
By the way, Nandita, you know..

652
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,500
..Harsh leads the perfect life.

653
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,500
Private jets, cars, wine, food and drink...

654
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,541
He does everything in style.

655
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,458
But just when you think
you've figured him out..

656
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,166
..he will surprise you. Right?

657
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,250
He's very sweet but also
very-very impulsive.

658
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,791
- Oh, come on Naina.
- Hey Naina.

659
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,666
Sheetal, I'll be right there.

660
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,416
- You guys chat, I'll be see you later.Sure.
- See you.

661
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:25,083
See you.

662
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,458
- So, enjoying the party.
- Yeah.

663
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,791
Frankly Nandita, I haven't
seen your Calendar..

664
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,041
..but I am sure you must
be looking gorgeous on it.

665
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,166
Thanks.

666
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:35,833
- So, is this your first time in Jodhpur?
- Yeah.

667
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:39,041
- I'm very happy to be here.
- That's nice.

668
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,291
How long are you planning to stay?

669
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,125
I've flight tomorrow morning at 6am.

670
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:45,000
- Back to Mumbai.
- Cancel the flight?

671
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,250
Huh... What?

672
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,125
Yeah, cancel the flight.

673
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:54,375
- Are you serious?
- Yes, we'll have breakfast tomorrow, at my stud farm.

674
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:58,333
- But..
- Don't worry, I'll send you back on my plane.

675
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:01,625
- But...
- My driver will be at your hotel.

676
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,625
See you then, tomorrow morning.

677
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:16,500
Nandita, this is our family stud farm...
and my passion too.

678
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,833
- Wow!
- I just love horses.

679
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,500
I keep an eye on each one of them.

680
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,500
And you know... some of these
horses are 4th generation breeds.

681
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,708
- Wow... do the horses take part in races?
- Of course they do.

682
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,500
They have won many derbies for us.

683
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,166
They have made us Narangs very proud.

684
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,875
That's nice.

685
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,708
So what's next.

686
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,875
I mean what's after Calendar Girls?

687
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,416
Well... my career's just started.

688
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,000
Offers are pouring in.

689
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,166
Next week I'll be the brand
ambassador of the Spastic Society.

690
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:54,375
By the way, I am not interested in movies..

691
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:55,708
..but I am getting some offers.

692
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,833
Let's see what happens. Hope for the best.

693
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,291
- Will you marry me?
- Huh?

694
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:04,291
Nandita, will you marry me?

695
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,666
Madam, a bouquet on Aman Khanna's birthday.

696
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,000

Rohit's wedding anniversary.

00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,500
So a bouquet worth 2000 for them.

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,750

And... one for Rishabh Chopra.

702
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,375
He's about to announce three films.

703
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,916
We'll send him the most
expensive one, worth 5000.

704
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:40,000
Anyway, Mr. Tiwari, tomorrow
is my driver Nakul's birthday.

705
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,250
- So we buy a bouquet for him as well?
- Of course, Tiwari.

706
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,666
We'll buy a bouquet worth 250..

707
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,583
..take a nice pic and post
it on the social media.

708
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:52,000
People should know how sensitive
Mayuri Chauhan is about her staff.

709
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,083
Wow... wow, madam.

710
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,666
This is called foresightedness.

711
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,666
No, Mr. Tiwari, it's called PR.

712
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,833
Wow... madam.

713
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:06,208
Honestly, you're going
to make it really big.

714
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,375
Thank you, Mr. Tiwari.

715
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:12,791
But, Mr. Tiwari. We're spending
so much on the film industry.

716
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,000
We've been sending bouquets,
but what's the next plan?

717
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,958
I don't want to do a handful of
films and go back to Rohtak.

718
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:24,708
I want big money, big star and big film.

719
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:29,208
Madam... even the biggest
stars don't get all three.

720
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,875
You have to wait.

721
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:36,500
There one guy... who can be
really beneficial to us.

722
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,500
We can extract money from them.

723
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,333
Builder Makhija's son Bablu
Makhija wants to be a hero.

724
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,833
And he's looking for a heroine.

725
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,458
He's willing to pay 10.5 million.

726
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,500
10.5 million?

727
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,500
Imagine... the things you
can do with 10.5 million.

728
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,000
10.5 million.

729
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:15,083
Yeah, what's up?

730
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,833
What are you saying?

731
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,458
It's started in Bandra as well.

732
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,083
What the hell...

733
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:23,875
These guys don't know the meaning of peace.

734
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,000
Okay, bye.

735
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,250
- What happened?
- It's the same old story, madam.

736
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,583
Pakistanis killed our
soldiers at the border.

737
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:38,083
And the entire country is staging
riots and shouting slogans.

738
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,291
What to say...

739
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:45,166
You know, madam... these
Pakistanis are good for nothing.

740
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,041
Am I right?

741
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:51,041
I am a Pakistani.

742
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,166
You...

743
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:56,166
Sorry... sorry, madam.

744
00:39:56,666 --> 00:40:00,666
I didn't mean to say it.

745
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,541
Sorry, madam.

746
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,291
Here we are, madam. We've arrived.

747
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:08,416
This is the drop point, right.

748
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:11,625
- Pakistani artists..
- Quit India.

749
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,000
Look, madam.

750
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,875
That lady in the photo looks like you.

751
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,625
That's you.

752
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,500
By staging rallies in many
parts of Mumbai city..

753
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,125
..people have said that Pakistani artists..

754
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:29,916
..should not be allowed to work in
Bollywood and the Glamour world.

755
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:31,750
Vande Mataram!

756
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,625
Vande Mataram!

757
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,625
What's going on, madam.

758
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,333
Vande Mataram!

759
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,000
Vande Mataram!

760
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,541
That's her! Nazneen Malik.

761
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:46,666
Don't worry, madam.

762
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,500
Come out! Come out!

763
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,791
Move. Crazy people.

764
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:51,958
It's her.

765
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,708
Drag her out!

766
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,416
Get me out of here.

767
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:58,875
Don't worry, madam. I'll
get you out of here.

768
00:40:59,375 --> 00:40:59,750
Don't worry.

769
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,333
Get lost.

770
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:05,333
Madam, don't be scared.

771
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:21,333
Sharon, for the first time
I was scared for my life.

772
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:25,333
Please... I am really scared, Sharon.

773
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:32,833
By the way, why don't you go
back to London for a while.

774
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,041
By then the situation will calm down.

775
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,833
No. Inzamam is in a fit of rage.

776
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,208
He's really unhappy.

777
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:45,208
London is not an option for me.

778
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,500
Then... you can stay here, in my apartment.

779
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,708
You can use anything you
want, just feel at home.

780
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,333
Thank you.

781
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,958
- Thank you so much.
- Stop all this.

782
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,333
No need to thank me.

783
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:01,875
In fact, I'm feeling bad that..

784
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,875
..you're so stressed and I have to go.

785
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,208
Naaz, if it wasn't for the Dubai show..

786
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,333
..I would've stayed with you.

787
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:10,875
But I'll be back in three days.

788
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,541
You take care of yourself, okay.

789
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:13,875
And don't be stressed.

790
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,500
If you need anything, call me.

791
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,750
Thank you.

792
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,583
"Vande Mataram!"
- Take care, bye.

793
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,916
- "Vande Mataram!"
- Bye.

794
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:26,458
Bye.

795
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,250
"Vande Mataram!"

796
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,666
"that Pakistani artists.."

797
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:37,000
"should not be allowed to work in
Bollywood and the Glamour world."

798
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,458
Hello.

799
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,708
- Hi, Naazneen. It's Vikrant Acharya speaking.
- Yes, sir.

800
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,333
I am sure you heard the news.

801
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,666
I just received some calls.

802
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:50,041
Maybe they know that we cast a
Pakistani heroine in our film.

803
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:53,541
Naazneen, you know we are supposed
to shoot entirely in Mumbai.

804
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,250
And shooting under these conditions..

805
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,875
You do understand what I am trying to say.

806
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:03,166
- Yes, sir... but this matter will soon be over..
- I'm sorry, Naazneen.

807
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,708
I cannot postpone the shooting
of my film any longer.

808
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,125
No way.

809
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,333
I'm sending my office-boy.
Please return the cheque.

810
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:14,333
But, sir... Hello... hello..

811
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,291
Yeah...

812
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,916
- 46 runs in 15 balls.
- What are you saying?

813
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:39,208
I mean come on...

814
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,833
- Seriously guys.
- Excuse me, guys...

815
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,583
- I'll be back in a second.
- Yeah.

816
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:43,958
Excuse me.

817
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,000
Hey gorgeous.

818
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,625
Paroma!

819
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,083
- I am so happy that you're here.
- Hi. Looking good.

820
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,666
You're looking nice.

821
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:55,500
Yeah, exactly. That's what I said.

822
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,666
Paroma, let me introduce you
to some special people.

823
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,875
Mr. Iyengar, he's an important selector
in the Mumbai Cricket Association.

824
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,291

00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:05,375
And this is Mr. Kariappam.
A big cricket enthusiast.

00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:06,375

00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,208

828
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,000
- Of course I do.
- He's a great spin bowler.

829
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,625
Bye, guys. Bye, see you. Come, Paroma.

830
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,416
Let me introduce you..

831
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:16,833
Mr. Manohar..

832
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,166
He's a big businessman..

833
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:21,083
..and the most important
member of this cricket league.

834
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:22,375
S. Vasant.

835
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:23,958
- Hi.

836
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:25,791

00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:29,250
- My good friend and 24 hour helpline.

838
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,916
Guys, I want you to meet Paroma Ghosh.

839
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:33,166
This years most beautiful Calendar girl.

840
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:34,000
Oh, really?

841
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,750
Be nice to her.

842
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,833
Everyone knows her.

843
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,083
And this is Akhil Sood.

844
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,458
Indian Batting Line-up's 'Run Machine'.

845
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,166
Of course I know him.

846
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:45,708
- I'm a big fan of yours.
- Thank you.

847
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:48,291
- How have you been?
- I'm good, how are you doing?

848
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:49,166
Good.

849
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:53,125
- It's so good to see you.
- Thank you.

850
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,125
Excuse me, guys.

851
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:58,125
Come, Paroma, I'll get you a drink. Come.

852
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:05,583
Honestly, Pinaki.

853
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:09,333
You really underplayed
yourself at Durga Pooja.

854
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:15,000
But now I see... you're
nothing short of a celebrity.

855
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,583
You know all the bigwigs.

856
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,041
Come on.

857
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:23,125
No, seriously. I am so proud of you.

858
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:27,125
Feelings mutual, I am
also very proud of you.

859
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:49,666
No, sir... there's no such problem.

860
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:52,250
What happened?

861
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,208
Nothing.

862
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:57,416
- So what are your plans?
- Plan?

863
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,333
What can be my plans after
three glasses of wine?

864
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:03,791
- Just go home and sleep.
- So early.

865
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:06,625
It's 3am.

866
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:12,041
What do you think? Will
I let you go so soon?

867
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,666
I don't know...

868
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:18,666
you already left once.

869
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:24,416
Hey...

870
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,500
Look at me.

871
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,250
I was helpless back then.

872
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,541
But it's all set now.

873
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:36,500
I won't leave now or let you go either.

874
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,875
"Where has my desires brought me?"

875
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:43,291
"It's a deluge of pain."

876
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:46,666
"Is it the heart making mistakes.."

877
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:50,041
"or the conspiracy of time."

878
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,458
"Where has my desires brought me?"

879
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:56,875
"It's a deluge of pain."

880
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:00,375
"Is it the heart making mistakes.."

881
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:04,375
"or the conspiracy of time."

882
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,208
Look, Nandita.

883
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:22,916
Every girl wants a boy like Harsh
and a family like the Narangs.

884
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:25,291
And that includes me too.

885
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:30,333
But, sister... you do know
about Harsh's condition.

886
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:32,625
I know.

887
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:35,500
But Nandita, it's not a condition at all.

888
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,250
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

889
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,458
- Your new Calendar came out recently, right?
- Right.

890
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:45,500
And that's why you're
getting so many offers.

891
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,833
Next year... when the
next calendar comes out..

892
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,250
..the offers will decrease as well.

893
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,500
And then gradually it might all stop.

894
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,041
Okay... look at it this way.

895
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:02,250
The companies you model for...

896
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:08,208
many of these companies
are owned by Harsh Narang.

897
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:11,500
Did you get the difference?

898
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,375
But, sister...

899
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:17,125
- Sister..
- Look, Nandita.

900
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:22,041
Harsh Narang is offering you
a good and comfortable life.

901
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:26,041
What more do you want?

902
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,750
What time is your flight?

903
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:41,708
So Nandita, we finally get to meet you.

904
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:47,333
You're far more beautiful than
what Harsh described you.

905
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,541
- Thank you.
- You really are a very pretty girl.

906
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:50,958
Thank you so much.

907
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:55,416
So Nandita... Harsh has been telling
me that you're a Calendar girl.

908
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:56,458
Yeah!

909
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:58,000
That must have been really exciting.

910
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,416
Yes, sir... it was great fun.

911
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:05,166
- And trust me... it was hard work.
- I can imagine.

912
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:10,291
Tell me something... how has life changed?

913
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:13,625
Earlier, I would take a snap at the
dining table along with my mom-dad.

914
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:18,500
And these days I see myself
on hoardings and television.

915
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,958
- I've heard good things about your mom and dad.
- Yeah.

916
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,041
And your sister too.

917
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:27,958
Actually I was under lot of pressure...
to do something.

918
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:31,958
And thank God... then
Calendar Girl happened.

919
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:37,666
Harsh.

920
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:42,666
Son, did you speak with Nandita?

921
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:47,166
- Yes, mom, I did..
- Aunty, I have decided.

922
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:48,541
I am quitting modeling.

923
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:52,541
That's nice.

924
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,666
Wow... that's great news.

925
00:49:56,166 --> 00:50:01,166
And Nandita, no more aunty.

926
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,458
- You can call me mom now.
- Yeah, I like this.

927
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,000
Alright.

928
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,416
Nandita, welcome to the Narang family.

929
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:11,666
- Cheers.
- Cheers.Cheers.

930
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:15,666
Cheers.

931
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:33,958
- Hey, Sharon.
- Hi.

932
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:36,541
Come. How are you, baby?

933
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:37,833
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

934
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:39,916
- And this is for you.
- Oh, my God. This is so lovely.

935
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:40,833
Thank you so much.

936
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:41,708
You're welcome.

937
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:42,416
Come.

938
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,541
- Wow, lovely house.
- Thank you.

939
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:45,458
So what...

940
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:48,375
Hey everybody, meet Calendar Girl Sharon.

941
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:51,166
- Hi.
- My gorgeous friend.

942
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:53,625
- Sharon, this is Neha.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

943
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,000
- Same here.
- And this is Rehan.

944
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:55,583
Hi.

945
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,000
Hi, I know you.

946
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:57,916
Really?

947
00:50:58,416 --> 00:50:59,500
Actually my friend Raghav,
he's a good friend...

948
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,500
..of that guy from TalentHub...
Anirudh Shroff.

949
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,791
And if I am not mistaken, Anirudh's
company handles your jobs, right?

950
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:11,333
- That's right.
- See, I said I know you.

951
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:15,750
And another thing, you
recently went to South Africa.

952
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,500
For an event.

953
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,083
You're very well informed.

954
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,208
Okay, Rehan, please don't bore her.

955
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:22,875
This is Sharon's first time at my place.

956
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:24,458
Come, Sharon. Let's go.

957
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:25,833
- Bye.
- What are you doing?

958
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:26,666
What?

959
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:28,416
- This is Olga.
- Hi.

960
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:29,875
Hi, pleased to meet you.

961
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:33,083
- And that's Aasma.
- Nice to see you.

962
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:33,958
So what do you think?

963
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,500
I think it's a great plan,
I'll get back to you.

964
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,500
That's nice.

965
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,958
Of course, should I try it?

966
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,333
- That's such a beautiful ring.
- Thank you so much.

967
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,375
Where did you get it from?

968
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:48,166
I got it at the Sunday Flea Market.

969
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:52,500
- So... how was South Africa?
- Good.

970
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,125
- Had fun?
- Lots.

971
00:51:57,625 --> 00:52:02,541
By the way, I've all the information
about what happened in South Africa.

972
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:05,958
Really? What happened in South Africa?

973
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,875
Let it be.

974
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:13,208
I guess you like cooking up
stories, or maybe you like lying.

975
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:17,375
Or maybe you're little drunk.

976
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:22,625
Babes... I don't cook-up stories or lie.

977
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:26,833
And for your kind
information, I don't drink.

978
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,583
Orange juice.

979
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:35,250
By the way, Anirudh is a fun guy, right?

980
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,291
You two stayed at the Marriott.

981
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:42,958
I can even tell you the room no.

982
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:47,500
Like you said, I am well informed.

983
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,833
Cheers.

984
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:55,166
That day was really fun.

985
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:59,166
Trying to hit on Sharon.

986
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:07,625
So... Rehan, can you please elaborate
on what happened in South Africa.

987
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:10,750
Suchi, explain your friend.

988
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,625
- Sharon..
- Guys, I really want to know.

989
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,625
Fine.

990
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,083
What's going on?

991
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,083
Rehan.

992
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:39,083
- Hello.
- Hey, Raghav, what's up?

993
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,916
Rehan, how are you?

994
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,791
What made you think of
me on a Saturday night?

995
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:46,333
I am at a friend's place,
we were just chatting.

996
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,250
And during the conversation
someone mentioned..

997
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,625
..about your friend Anirudh.

998
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:53,541
- What topic?
- The same thing you told me, about the Calendar girl.

999
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:56,375
- That South Africa scene.
- It wasn't just a scene..

1000
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,000
..it was an entire film.

1001
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,625
And what a coincidence.

1002
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,583
That bloody lucky Anirudh
is sitting right here.

1003
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:04,458
You can hear it straight from him.
From the horse's mouth.

1004
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:06,166
Rehan.

1005
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:07,958
Hey, bro, how is it going?

1006
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,000
All well, buddy, how about you?

1007
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,416
By the way, I've heard that..

1008
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,083
..you've been having a great
time in South Africa.

1009
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,833
Well, you know I am a lucky guy.

1010
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,083
- So how was she?
- Who?

1011
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,875
Sharon Pinto.

1012
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:23,000
She's a great girl.

1013
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,416
Dude, she was all over me.

1014
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:27,708
We both tried everything in the hotel room.

1015
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:31,583
Be it the bathroom or balcony.

1016
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:35,625
I've never been with such
a flexible girl before.

1017
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,333
Awesome buddy, awesome.

1018
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,583
- Anyway, I'll catch you next week right.
- Yeah.

1019
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:43,583
- We'll meet up. See you, buddy. Bye.
- See you.

1020
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,500
- Rehan.
- What?

1021
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,583
You didn't have to do this.

1022
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,375
Sharon. Sharon, stop.

1023
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:02,375
Sharon, wait. Sharon.

1024
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,833
You need this outline also.

1025
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:14,500
Hey Sharon, how is it going, sweetheart..

1026
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,166
You were only spreading rumors till now..

1027
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:17,458
..that I slept with you.

1028
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,708
Now go and tell everyone the truth.

1029
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:21,750
That after returning from South Africa..

1030
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,625
..Sharon slapped you in your
office, in front of your staff.

1031
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,791
I don't work with sleezeballs like you.

1032
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,708
You came to me, I didn't.

1033
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:34,708
You're fired!

1034
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:43,500
Damn it!

1035
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,208
Sharon, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.

1036
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:48,125
You're a successful Calender girl.

1037
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,041
And I would cast in every second ad.

1038
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:52,583
Thank you.

1039
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,500
But there's a problem.

1040
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,500
Anirudh Shroff.

1041
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,458
His company handles the casting for us.

1042
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:06,041
I've also known him
personally for many years.

1043
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:10,000
And I also know that he can
be a bit of a loudmouth.

1044
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,625
You know what I mean.

1045
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,541
But who can argue with success.

1046
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,041
The entire Industry knows about..

1047
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:22,500
..what happened between you and Anirudh.

1048
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,750
And if I still cast you,
he'll feel offended.

1049
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:36,625
I might be a big and
successful ad-film maker.

1050
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,500
But still...

1051
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,708
I cannot lock horns with Anirudh.

1052
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,375
Excuse me, sir, presentation is ready.

1053
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:47,375
Okay.

1054
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,750
- I hope you understand.
- Yeah

1055
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,750
I am sorry.

1056
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:15,000
Wow... that was chilling.

1057
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Mayuri ma'am, this was fun.

1058
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,291
Mr. Tiwari..

1059
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:23,083
I think we should do that
builder Makhija's film.

1060
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:27,250
Wow... Mayuri ma'am,
that's the right decision.

1061
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:32,000
- But... is the boy any good looking?
- Yes, he's handsome.

1062
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,500
He's got a funky hairstyle...
and he's also built a body.

1063
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,875
But, Mr. Tiwari... this
film is good for now.

1064
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:43,416
But until the hero's name
isn't Khan, Kapoor or Kumar..

1065
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:45,250
..then there's no fun in doing the film.

1066
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:49,166
I'll get you a big film
Mayuri ma'am, just wait.

1067
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:53,541
But Mr. Tiwari... will
this film harm my career?

1068
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:56,208
I mean... image is important as well.

1069
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:59,083
And once I get into that bracket..

1070
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:05,500
..then I'll be doing films for
politicians and builder's sons.

1071
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,500
Mayuri ma'am, you worry a lot.

1072
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,875
Let me tell you one thing.

1073
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:16,166
Lot of films get signed,
they even start shooting..

1074
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:20,375
..but in the middle if you're offered
a film with Khan or Kapoor..

1075
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,833
..then you put these Makhija
types film on the hold..

1076
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,208
..and start shooting for the new film.

1077
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,625
We'll do just like the other stars.

1078
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,458
- You do know the saying in Bollywood, don't you?
- Which one?

1079
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,541
Many films get made..

1080
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:40,500
..but a real film is the
one that gets released.

1081
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,750
- Mr. Tiwari, you're a rock star.
- Thank you.

1082
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,208
Wow.

1083
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,333
But, Mr. Tiwari, what's the
schedule for tomorrow's shooting?

1084
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:52,500
No shooting tomorrow, ma'am..

1085
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,333
..we've to attend a
memorial service tomorrow.

1086
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:56,500
What? Who died?

1087
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,791
There's been a death in a
small business family.

1088
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:00,958
We've to go there and
express our condolences.

1089
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:02,166
They're willing to pay good money.

1090
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,375
I fixed the deal for 200,000.

1091
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,541
Mr. Tiwari, I had heard about
ribbon cutting and marriages.

1092
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:12,416
- But when did this begin?
- I started this.

1093
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:15,750
But, Mr. Tiwari, what
will I have to do there?

1094
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,750
Leave that to me.

1095
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:09,708
Dear...

1096
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:12,750
I was really upset hearing about uncle.

1097
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,000
Goodbye.

1098
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,125
Goodbye.

1099
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,500
Ma'am, can I take a selfie with you?

1100
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,500
Okay.

1101
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,666
- Is that 200,000?
- No.

1102
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:33,083
The deal was 200,000 for the attendance.

1103
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:35,500
I charged them 100,000 extra..

1104
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,458
..for standing in the queue,
joining hands and for pics.

1105
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,416
So that's 300,000.

1106
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:44,125
Mr. Tiwari, you will make it really big.

1107
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:47,208
Not just me, madam. We
both will make it big.

1108
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:52,000
Someday you will be at
the Parliament House.

1109
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,000
- Mr. Tiwari.
- Madam.

1110
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:05,708
- Naazneen.
- Yes.

1111
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:17,208
You're absolutely safe here, trust me.

1112
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:22,458
I heard about your situation,
and I even took a close look.

1113
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:25,708
You really had a tough time, haven't you?

1114
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:26,958
So I thought of meeting you.

1115
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:30,375
I would like to help.

1116
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,958
I'll come straight to the point.

1117
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:38,000
My company is always
looking for professionals.

1118
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,958
The job profile is very simple.

1119
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:41,500
Very simple.

1120
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,583
Basically you just have to
entertain our VVIP clients.

1121
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:51,250
There are already many girls on our panel.

1122
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:59,166
We have... models, TV
stars, Films Actresses...

1123
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:03,958
Obviously, I can't divulge their name.

1124
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:09,958
Because secrecy is a very important
part of our work ethics.

1125
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:13,458
Because our clients include
top of the line politicians..

1126
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:17,458
.. industrialists and diplomats.

1127
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:25,041
There's not much to do. It's very simple.

1128
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,250
You'll take a late night flight.

1129
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:31,666
A private car will pick
you up at the airport.

1130
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:35,666
And take you to a five-star
hotel or a farmhouse.

1131
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:44,041
Next morning... you take the
first flight back home.

1132
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:48,666
And all this is done with
extreme confidentiality.

1133
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:51,500
Even your neighbors won't have a clue..

1134
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,791
..that you weren't home all night.

1135
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:59,333
I've told you about the job...

1136
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:04,583
now I'll tell you about the money.

1137
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:08,583
You earn... a minimum of
2 million every month.

1138
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:22,708
This means... you want to
make me an escort girl?

1139
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,375
What's in the name?

1140
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:29,375
What's important is the job.

1141
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:57,250
Always looking so sexy, not fair.

1142
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:03,791
Yeah, Chaddha.

1143
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:06,833
One minute, I'll be back.

1144
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:09,625
Yeah.

1145
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,041
Are you crazy?

1146
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:12,583
No way, Chaddha.

1147
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,291
You tell him.. You tell that
bugger to stay away from her.

1148
01:04:15,791 --> 01:04:16,416
Tell him right now.

1149
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:19,333
You tell him he can't
have this at any cost.

1150
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:23,333
And if he does it again I'll beat him up!

1151
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:36,125
Damn you Akhil Sood.

1152
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:37,791
- Pinaki.
- Hmmm..

1153
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,416
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

1154
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:42,625
- What happened?
- Nothing, Chaddha called..

1155
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:43,666
..and we had an argument.

1156
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:45,958
What? Why?

1157
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,708
Because he looks after that
bloody Akhil Sood's jobs..

1158
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:50,625
..and Akhil was saying..

1159
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:53,166
- Forget it.
- Akhil.

1160
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:56,291
Did he say something to you?

1161
01:04:56,791 --> 01:05:00,958
- Paroma... that bugger really likes you.
- What?

1162
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:03,333
He's gone crazy since
the moment he saw you.

1163
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:08,125
- He's lost his mind.
- But... doesn't he know we're a couple.

1164
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:09,500
No one knows, Paroma.

1165
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,666
Not just Akhil, no one knows.

1166
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:14,375
- Why didn't you tell anyone?
- Because Paroma..

1167
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:17,958
..it's not part of my plan.

1168
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:20,458
- Paroma..
- What plan?

1169
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:21,833
What are you saying?

1170
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:25,875
To leave this country and
settle down in the US.

1171
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:27,000
What?

1172
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,125
The cricket league's going
to begin in two weeks..

1173
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,791
..and I have just one plan.

1174
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:34,208
Make money.

1175
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,250
That's why I befriended that Chaddha.

1176
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,375
And Chaddha introduced me to...
that bloody Akhil.

1177
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:41,833
Cricket league... money?

1178
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:46,375
Cricket league is the biggest
gambling den of this country.

1179
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,583
In two months, lot of matches are played.

1180
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:52,833
People make so much money...
and they bet so much money..

1181
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:56,916
..that you can buy 10 homes in New York.

1182
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:01,666
And this time... I want to
make at least 1 Billion.

1183
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,416
That's why I befriended Akhil.

1184
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:06,125
And with his help I am
going to do spot-fixing..

1185
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:11,208
..because he's got three
players that do his bidding.

1186
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:15,500
It's for our future, that's why
he's so important to my plans.

1187
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,208
To our future, baby.

1188
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,958
Are you with me?

1189
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:22,500
Paroma.

1190
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,791
Think, Paroma. Think big.

1191
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:30,791
Think.

1192
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:46,250
Pinaki... I don't know what to say to you.

1193
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:54,916
But I know that I can do anything for you.

1194
01:06:55,416 --> 01:07:01,416
- And you know... I love you.
- Come here.

1195
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:05,833
Come here.

1196
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:08,833
- I love you, Pinaki.
- I love you too.

1197
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:12,833
It'll all be fine.

1198
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:26,958
Can I ask... who will I be meeting?

1199
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:30,291
Power-broker.

1200
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:31,958
They're a community..

1201
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:36,750
..which even the most powerful
people in this country need.

1202
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:41,291
There are some jobs which only they can do.

1203
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:47,000
They are seen very less, but do a lot.

1204
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:54,875
After today... no one in this
country can ever harm you.

1205
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,875
Go on.

1206
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:11,791
Please sit.

1207
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:34,125
Naazneen...

1208
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:37,500
these clothes belong to my wife.

1209
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,833
No, she's still alive.

1210
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:45,166
I love her a lot...

1211
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:47,125
but she's put on weight.

1212
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:50,000
She can't fit into these now.

1213
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,500
These are all branded clothes, all of them.

1214
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,125
See... this is Blueberry.

1215
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:03,041
This is Louis Vitton... and
this one's Jimmy Chu..

1216
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:05,250
Jimmy Chu.

1217
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:09,250
Jimmy Chu.

1218
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:12,708
Sorry.

1219
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,791
Wear this one.

1220
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:19,791
You'll look nice, very nice.

1221
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:43,791
"I never imagined even in my dreams."
- Coming out.

1222
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:50,375
"That the sun would scorch
me even under the shade."

1223
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:54,125
"Where has my desires brought me?"

1224
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:57,750
"It's a deluge of pain."

1225
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:01,541
"Is it the heart making mistakes.."

1226
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:05,541
"or the conspiracy of time."

1227
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:16,333
Sharon, don't get me wrong.

1228
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:18,958
But I think you over-reacted.

1229
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:23,750
And your glamour industry is
entirely based on relationships.

1230
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:27,708
Suchita... I did what I had to.

1231
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:32,625
And Anirudh did what he had to.

1232
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,958
I don't regret any of this.

1233
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,500
And anyway I feeling very suffocated.

1234
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,083
This rat-race is not my cup of tea.

1235
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:45,250
I think I'm destined for something else.

1236
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:49,250
And sooner or later I will find it.

1237
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,791
- Hello.
- Hi, Sharon, how are you?

1238
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:55,333
Hi, Nandita.

1239
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:58,041
Breaking news, I'm getting married.

1240
01:10:58,541 --> 01:10:59,500
What? How?

1241
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,375
When did this happen?

1242
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:03,000
It just happened.

1243
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:03,875
I'll tell you everything.

1244
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:06,166
But first things first,
the wedding is on 24th..

1245
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:07,625
..and you have to be here.

1246
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:08,875
Of course I'll be there.

1247
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:10,833
I'm sending a private jet for all of you.

1248
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,083
- Private jet?
- Yeah.

1249
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:14,041
Wow!

1250
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:16,125
I've informed everyone else.

1251
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:18,875
- Come together. Okay?
- Sure, babe.

1252
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,875
Congratulations, see you.

1253
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:27,125
Enough chit-chat.

1254
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:31,125
Come on, girls.

1255
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,166
"The sway drives you mad."

1256
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:41,666
"My hip sways crazily."

1257
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,625
"The sway drives you mad."

1258
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:45,458
"My hip sways crazily."

1259
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:48,833
"Sometimes it's Desi and sometimes
it sways to the English beats."

1260
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:52,375
"The DJ..."

1261
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,791
"The DJ plays the beats to invite."

1262
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,500
"Let's sway..."

1263
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,041
"Let's sway on the wedding night."

1264
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:04,458
"Let's sway on the wedding night."

1265
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:08,000
"Let's sway on the wedding night."

1266
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,000
"Let's sway on the wedding night."

1267
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:28,875
"Lovers are crazy about
our gorgeous attitude."

1268
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:35,875
"They have all lost their
mind watching me."

1269
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:39,166
"Lovers are crazy about
our gorgeous attitude."

1270
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:42,958
"They have all lost their
mind watching me."

1271
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:46,333
"After drinking from my eyes..."

1272
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:49,708
"After drinking from my eyes
they are all really tight."

1273
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:53,375
"Let's sway on the wedding night."

1274
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,875
"Let's sway on the wedding night."

1275
01:12:57,375 --> 01:13:00,416
"Let's sway on the wedding night."

1276
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:03,791
"Let's sway on the wedding night."

1277
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:07,291
"The sway drives you mad."

1278
01:13:07,791 --> 01:13:10,708
"My hip sways crazily."

1279
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:12,583
"The sway drives you mad."

1280
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:14,333
"My hip sways crazily."

1281
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:17,833
"Sometimes it's Desi and sometimes
it sways to the English beats."

1282
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:21,291
"The DJ..."

1283
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:25,291
"The DJ plays the beats to invite."

1284
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:54,208
- Hi.
- Hi?

1285
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:58,541
- I think I... know you?
- I know you too.

1286
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:02,750
Even I watch India's most watched
journalist's primetime show.

1287
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,625
Pleasure to bump into you...
Shashank Dutta.

1288
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,625
I am Sharon Pinto by the way.

1289
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:10,583
- Calendar Girl.
- Yes, yes, yes... Sharon.

1290
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:11,958
Right.

1291
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:15,708
So... did you find any interesting book?

1292
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:18,666
Unfortunately... I couldn't
find any interesting books..

1293
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:21,375
..or any interesting jobs.

1294
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,416
Why?

1295
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:25,958
Bored of modeling?

1296
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:29,958
Totally.

1297
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,458
By the way, I don't know if this helps.

1298
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:36,791
But our network's starting
a new entertainment show.

1299
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:38,750
And we're looking for fresh anchors.

1300
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,625
Why don't you give it a shot?

1301
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:42,708
Here's my card.

1302
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:45,583
Just give me a call and drop in.

1303
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:48,083
You never know.

1304
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:52,083
- See you.
- Bye.

1305
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:16,208
Excuse me, ma'am. Your dress.

1306
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:20,208
- This?
- Yes, ma'am.

1307
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:24,208
Whatever?

1308
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,750
Welcome aboard, sir.

1309
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,750
What can I offer you?

1310
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:55,916
A lot.

1311
01:15:57,541 --> 01:15:59,708
How do you like my plane?

1312
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:03,708
It's beautiful.

1313
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:13,416
Mickey, you could've asked me before
writing such kind of a story.

1314
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:14,916
You published everything
according to your convenience..

1315
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:16,041
..claiming its from your sources.

1316
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:19,500
Bloody who are these sources?

1317
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,416
- What's wrong, Mr. Arun.
- Mr. Tiwari.

1318
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:25,583
I forgot to wish my Guru, Director
Arindham happy birthday..

1319
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,916
..and the media turned
this front page news.

1320
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:30,250
Mr. Tiwari, they say that
we're having a fight.

1321
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,625
Nonsense... I don't believe this.

1322
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:35,041
I don't remember my wife's birthday..

1323
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:36,833
..how can I remember anyone else' birthday.

1324
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:40,458
- I remember everything, Mr. Arun.
- How is that?

1325
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:42,500
See that... Mayuri.

1326
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,750
- Follow her on Twitter.
- Okay.

1327
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:48,083
At exactly midnight she wishes
actors, directors, cricketers..

1328
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:49,875
..even social activists.

1329
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,833
- Even those who are dead.
- What are you saying?

1330
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:54,875
She wishes them as well.

1331
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:56,708
- Recently the state of Telengana was formed.
- Yes.

1332
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:59,041
And she wished him happy birthday at 12.

1333
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,458
- Are you serious, Mr. Tiwari?
- Yes.

1334
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,958
Mr. Tiwari, this girl is quite dangerous.

1335
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,083
Right.

1336
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:06,500
I'll follow her right away.

1337
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,625
Mr. Tiwari, believe me.

1338
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:10,500
- Some day this girl will make it really big.
- Correct.

1339
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,041
Ooo... Mr. Makhija.

1340
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:13,500
- Sir, just a second.
- Yes.

1341
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,041
Hello.

1342
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:19,750
- Mayuri, the piper pair are here.
- What?

1343
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,166
Piper betel, Mayuri ma'am. It comes
in pair, and also eaten in pair.

1344
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:25,458
Builder Makhija and his son Bablu Makhija..

1345
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:27,458
- ..have arrived at the studio.
- What?

1346
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:29,541
Why did you call them here, Mr. Tiwari?

1347
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:32,833
10.5 millio, Mayuri. Don't
you want to buy that flat?

1348
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:34,458
Fine, make them sit in the corner.

1349
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,916
- I'll join you.
- Corner?

1350
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:41,083
Mr. Tiwari, they are
paying me 10.5 million.

1351
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,000
Fine. I'll make them sit in the corner.

1352
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,916
Corner?

1353
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:51,541
Mayuri, we just saw the trailer
of your upcoming film.

1354
01:17:52,041 --> 01:17:54,458
It's a big hit.

1355
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:57,666
- And I've put up your Calendar in my bedroom.
- See.

1356
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:01,541
Oh, my God. You're so sweet.

1357
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,541
Sit down. Sit down.

1358
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:07,916
You know, Mayuri, I've no words to
express how happy my family is..

1359
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:12,166
..since they all found out
that Bablu's is your hero.

1360
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:17,125
And I had no clue there's talent
hidden right in my house.

1361
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:20,500
All my relatives in US and
London and flying down.

1362
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,333
And I've also called some
Ministers as well from Delhi.

1363
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:25,083
For the Opening Shot.

1364
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:28,750
After all its Bablu's
film, so no compromise.

1365
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,666
Wait a minute.

1366
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:35,958
Mayuri, this is cheque of 5.1
million, your signing amount.

1367
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:37,458
Take a look.

1368
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:39,750
Mr. Makhija.

1369
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:44,916
I've also brought a small gift for you.

1370
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:48,000
Here. Latest Ipad.

1371
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,000
Mr. Makhija, you shouldn't have.

1372
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,625
What are you saying, madam?

1373
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,083
This is my first meeting with you.

1374
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:57,250
I couldn't have come empty-handed.

1375
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,458
So will you come
empty-handed the next time?

1376
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,750
No, I mean..

1377
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:05,291
Just kidding, Mr. Makhija. Just kidding.

1378
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:08,916
- She is kidding.
- Excuse me, ma'am. Your shot is ready.

1379
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:10,875
- Shot. Shot.
- One second.

1380
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:12,833
Mr. Makhija, I have to go now.

1381
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,125
You see, my shot's ready.

1382
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,041
And you know I am very punctual.

1383
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:19,791
And I don't want anyone to
incur any loss because of me.

1384
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:24,833
- Yes, yes...
- See... now that's call professionalism.

1385
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,500
Okay.

1386
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,500
- Mr. Makhija.
- Yeah.

1387
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:37,666
Bablu.

1388
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:39,375
Take care, okay.

1389
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,791
Okay, ciao.

1390
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:45,291
Have a cup of tea?

1391
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:49,500
- How is she?
- She's so down to earth.

1392
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,458
Isn't she your 10 million heroine?

1393
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,583
Bablu is really lucky.

1394
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:59,583
Very nice. Very nice.

1395
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:04,500
Hey... hi.

1396
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,500
- Nervous?
- No?

1397
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,500
- Do you remember who you've to talk to?
- Yeah.

1398
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,291
I love you.

1399
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:23,291
- I love you too.
- Good.

1400
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:34,291
Hi, Paroma. How are you?

1401
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:36,583
- He's Gary.
- Hi, there. Nice to meet you.

1402
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:37,833
You know, Garry, I must say.

1403
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,416
She's one of the hottest girls.

1404
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:44,416
Yeah, she's got a long way to go.

1405
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:53,708
She's hot, man.

1406
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:03,333
Look at her... talk to her later.

1407
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:07,333
"Ain't no sunshine."

1408
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,958
- Hold this glass.
- Okay.

1409
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:16,958
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1410
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:22,333
- Hello.
- Hi.

1411
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:25,375
What's up.

1412
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:28,458
- You're looking gorgeous.
- Yeah, how've you been?

1413
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:32,791
In fact, sizzling hot.

1414
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:34,833
You're so wicked.

1415
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:39,083
See you at my farm house.

1416
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:40,416
That's hot.

1417
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:44,416
- Cheers, guys. We will have a party.
- Cheers!

1418
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:12,333
In tomorrow's match, you won't
score more than 10 runs.

1419
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:20,291
Is that all?

1420
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:22,458
I can even rip out my heart
for you, sweetheart.

1421
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:23,666
Giving up my wicket is no big deal.

1422
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:29,958
And your three friends
who come in after you..

1423
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:39,500
..tell them... the team
total shouldn't exceed 120.

1424
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,541
How about I kill all of them?

1425
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,541
And then it'll be just you and me.

1426
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:10,708
Come on, Akhil.

1427
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:01,083
Keep an eye on them.

1428
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:02,625
Bollywood industry is a place..

1429
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:05,291
..where everything looks
beautiful on the top.

1430
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:09,541
But there's a huge difference in the
life before the camera and behind it.

1431
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:13,375
Do you know that before the
superstar of Bollywood..

1432
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:18,541
..got his first film, who
humiliated him the most?

1433
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,291
Who was the director who
didn't just humiliate him..

1434
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:23,250
..but also said that "You should go home".

1435
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,208
Exactly two years later,
the same director..

1436
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:27,375
..arrived at the doorstep of that
actor to sign him for a film.

1437
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:30,791
Next week we'll bring you some
more Bollywood inside stories.

1438
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:33,250
This is Sharon Pinto, and you're
watching your favorite show..

1439
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:34,833
..'Sitaaron ki Baat'.

1440
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:36,708
- Was it okay?
- Yeah.

1441
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:39,083
Thanks.

1442
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,500
- Hi, Shashank.
- Hi, Sharon.

1443
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,250
- I was watching you.
- Oh, really?

1444
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,750
- And?
- Frankly speaking, Sharon..

1445
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:49,291
..I didn't know that a model
can be such a good anchor.

1446
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:52,625
Honestly Shashank, I didn't know either.

1447
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:54,000
But that's the beauty of life.

1448
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,916
Like they say, when one door
closes many other opens.

1449
01:24:58,416 --> 01:24:59,500
The same thing happened with me.

1450
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,833
By the way, it's written in Gita as well.

1451
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,791
Let things happen.

1452
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:07,750
Just relax and go with the flow.

1453
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:10,083
Actually, I added that last line.

1454
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:11,875
That's really impressive.

1455
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:15,875
- So I'll catch you later then.
- Yeah, sure.

1456
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:24,750
- Woah.
- Thank you.

1457
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:25,958
Yeah.

1458
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:28,583
Wait... sir, can I take a photo with you?

1459
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,375
Come, click a selfie.

1460
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:31,458
Now go and speedup.

1461
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,083
Excuse me.

1462
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:35,166
Sir, can I click a selfie with you, please?

1463
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:38,250
- What's this selfie?
- Sir, it's the last day of our shoot.

1464
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:40,583
- I need one photo for Twitter.
- Okay.

1465
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:43,458
Smile.

1466
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:45,000
Great work, Mayuri.

1467
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,833
I like your work very much.

1468
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,625
This film's definitely a hit.

1469
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,666
The credit goes to you, sir.

1470
01:25:51,166 --> 01:25:54,541
I heard that you signed another
film with some newcomer.

1471
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:58,250
Yes, sir. It's with Makhija
Builder's son Bablu Makhija.

1472
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,375
- I see.
- Good role and better cash.

1473
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:02,625
- What?
- I mean money.

1474
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,000
It's very good money.

1475
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,916
And which film after that?

1476
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:10,666
- After that it's your film.
- You're very smart, Mayuri.

1477
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,208
You'll make it really big.

1478
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:13,750
I know, sir. Thank you.

1479
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,458
Excuse me, sir... excuse me.

1480
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:17,875
Madam... please.

1481
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,333
What's wrong, Mr. Tiwari?

1482
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:21,416
Breaking news, madam. Breaking news.

1483
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,541
Do you know who's shooting at the next set?

1484
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:27,625
Who?

1485
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,541
- Really?
- Yeah.

1486
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:31,875
- Honestly.
- Yes.

1487
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:33,625
Mr. Tiwari.

1488
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:37,875
I am not making anything on
3G scam or the cricket scam.

1489
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:40,083
Nor on any star's divorce.

1490
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:42,500
I'll tell you if I'm doing
something like that.

1491
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,458
Oh my, God. Madhur Bhandarkar.

1492
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:49,500
Sir, I am a big fan.

1493
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,500
Mayuri.

1494
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,666
- Mayuri Chauhan.
- Hi.

1495
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:55,875
I was a Calendar Girl. And I
was shooting at the next set..

1496
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:57,666
..because you know, I
just completed a film..

1497
01:26:58,166 --> 01:26:59,500
..and I found out that you're here.

1498
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,083
So I came running.

1499
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,125
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

1500
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:06,375
That's alright, sir. Can I please
speak to you for two minutes?

1501
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:09,291
Yeah, come.

1502
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:13,083
- So, are you from Mumbai?
- No, sir, I am from Rohtak.

1503
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:14,250
Excuse me, sir.

1504
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,500
- Sir, the shot might get delayed.
- Why? What's wrong?

1505
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,541
Sir, Kavya ma'am is having
trouble with her makeup.

1506
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:20,416
I'm making heroine oriented films..

1507
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,375
..so I don't have to put
up with star tantrums.

1508
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:24,333
Now will I have to endure
their tantrums as well?

1509
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,583
Look, I've to leave at 6pm
for a award function.

1510
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:29,375
But sir, you went to a award
function yesterday as well.

1511
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:30,500
Yes, I did.

1512
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,666
Today I'm handing out awards to those
who didn't get an award yesterday.

1513
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:35,791
- Do you have a problem? Tell Kavya to speedup.
- Okay, sir.

1514
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,041
Yes... so?

1515
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:40,125
Sir, I've seen all your films.

1516
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:42,875
And do you know what the best
thing about your films is?

1517
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:47,000
They're realistic as well as
there's a lot of exposure.

1518
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,541
- I really love it.
- Thanks.

1519
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:52,291
And sir, there's one thing
common between you and me.

1520
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:53,291
What?

1521
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:58,666
Just like you, even I made my
life with obstinacy and not hope.

1522
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:00,583
Sir, the block is ready.
Please check the frame.

1523
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:01,916
Yeah, I'll come.

1524
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:04,583
Nice, Mayuri. Lovely meeting you.

1525
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:07,083
- Sir, pleasure is all mine.
- Thanks.

1526
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,458
Sir, if you don't mind can I
please take a selfie with you?

1527
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:13,458
- For Twitter?
- Yeah, okay.

1528
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:20,583
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

1529
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:24,958
- Mr. Tiwari.
- Yes.

1530
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:27,375
Aren't you going to say that
I'll make it big someday?

1531
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:32,958
Mayuri madam, you've already made it big.

1532
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:35,041
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1533
01:28:35,541 --> 01:28:38,583
- What a lovely party.
- Seriously.

1534
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:40,250
Isn't that Mr. Taren's fianc?

1535
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,916
- That's really good?
- Yeah.

1536
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:43,916
- That's right. I love the food..
- Yeah.

1537
01:28:44,416 --> 01:28:46,250
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.Sure.

1538
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,791
- Thank you.
- All your parties are amazing.

1539
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:50,625
Neha. Super party.

1540
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:51,958
Thank you.

1541
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:54,083
Just excuse me.

1542
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,250
- Hello.
- How are you?

1543
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:59,333
Perfect, darling.

1544
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:03,583
Last time I met you in Jodhpur,
you were Calendar Girl.

1545
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:07,875
And this time... its Mrs.
Nandita Harsh Narang.

1546
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,125
Wow, now that's what I call success?

1547
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:11,250
Yeah!

1548
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,750
But don't forget. I play cupid.

1549
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:18,083
Yeah, and this cupid has time to show
up at Mrs. Agarwal's card party.

1550
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:19,750
But not at our wedding.

1551
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,500
I'm so sorry, I was at the Caribbean.

1552
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,708
By the way, where's Harsh?

1553
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:29,708
There.

1554
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,208
Why not?

1555
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:38,000
Harsh is having fun.

1556
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,250
But I don't blame him.

1557
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,166
After all he's travelling so much..

1558
01:29:42,666 --> 01:29:44,958
- On his business meetings.
- Yeah.

1559
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:47,833
I hope you go along with him.

1560
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:51,333
Sometimes... to keep him company?

1561
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:55,333
Trust me, darling, I am a wife.

1562
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:58,916
It's always a good idea to
keep an eye on the husband.

1563
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:05,041
Especially when your husband is...
Mr. Popular.

1564
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:08,208
Hey, Naina.

1565
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:12,208
Excuse me.

1566
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:18,708
- All yours.
- Yeah!

1567
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:45,791
- The crowd at the party was great, right?
- Yeah, good.

1568
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:47,125
Bloody... who are these stupid people..

1569
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,375
..sending me Candy Crush requests?

1570
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:52,666
Bloody idiots.

1571
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,375
- You're going to Mumbai.
- Hmmm.

1572
01:30:55,875 --> 01:31:00,083
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.

1573
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:04,583
I want to come along.

1574
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:07,958
It's been really long since
I met some of my friends.

1575
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:09,708
Do you have a problem?

1576
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,666
- Me?
- Not at all.

1577
01:31:13,166 --> 01:31:16,666
Come along.

1578
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:58,208
Hi, Naazneen.

1579
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:02,208
Harsh?

1580
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,291
I think I am in the wrong room.

1581
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:11,125
I was supposed to show up for
an ad meeting, but I so sorry..

1582
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:13,125
Chill, Nazneen.

1583
01:32:13,625 --> 01:32:17,125
Ananya Raichand sent you, right?

1584
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,833
First time... I saw you in a blue bikini.

1585
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,916
You were the hottest on the calendar.

1586
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:34,416
Even on my wedding, you
were looking sexist.

1587
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:38,416
More than my wife.

1588
01:33:23,916 --> 01:33:27,125
- Naaz.
- Yeah.

1589
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:31,500
I need to talk to you.

1590
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,916
About Harsh.

1591
01:33:35,416 --> 01:33:38,583
Naaz...

1592
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:42,583
Harsh is cheating on me.

1593
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:48,250
I've seen his call details.

1594
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:51,666
And I'm sure he's sleeping around.

1595
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,958
You know he's involved
with those kind of girls.

1596
01:33:55,458 --> 01:34:00,083
Like the ones who pretend
to be pious by the day..

1597
01:34:00,583 --> 01:34:02,291
..but during the night...

1598
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:04,666
What do you call them?

1599
01:34:05,166 --> 01:34:07,875
Escorts.

1600
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:12,291
Naaz, how can you sleep with
a different guy every night?

1601
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:14,541
Just for money?

1602
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:18,750
It's... so disgusting.

1603
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:24,250
How do these girls face themselves.

1604
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,208
Third grade girls.

1605
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:29,583
Bloody characterless.

1606
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:32,958
Hello, girls.

1607
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:36,500
Hi, baby.

1608
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,083
- Naazneen, you know her right?
- Of course.

1609
01:34:40,583 --> 01:34:42,375
She was at our wedding.

1610
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:46,500
- Hi, Naazneen, how are you doing?
- Fine.

1611
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,333
- All well?
- Yeah.

1612
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:53,083
Sit.

1613
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:55,125
What's going on?

1614
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,041
Nothing, just catching up.

1615
01:34:57,541 --> 01:34:58,583
Nice.

1616
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:01,250
Nandita, I just forgot.

1617
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:04,583
I just remembered that I've
to go for an urgent meeting.

1618
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:06,666
- What?
- Yeah.

1619
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:09,500
Naaz, come on. We just got here.

1620
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,500
What's wrong?

1621
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1622
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,083
- What's wrong, Naazneen, all good?
- No, thank you.

1623
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:18,958
- Are you okay, Naaz?
- Yeah, I am fine.

1624
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:20,625
Naazneen, stay, have lunch with us.

1625
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:21,750
I am so sorry.

1626
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:26,916
- At least finish your coffee.
- Yeah, but I am really getting late.

1627
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:28,500
Okay...

1628
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,541
- Naaz, listen to me.
- See you soon.

1629
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:31,708
- Naaz..
- Bye.

1630
01:35:32,208 --> 01:35:36,041
- Come on, Naaz, what happened?
- Nothing.

1631
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:40,000
Naaz.

1632
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:41,208
Strange girl.

1633
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:45,208
I don't know what..

1634
01:35:51,791 --> 01:35:54,416
Are you okay, babes?

1635
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:58,416
Are you alright?

1636
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:05,083
Till then, it's me Sharon
Pinto signing off..

1637
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:06,458
..from 'Sitaron Ki Baat'

1638
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:08,541
Take care, work hard and party harder.

1639
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:11,000
Ciao.

1640
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,041
Okay.

1641
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:17,250
- Hey Sharon, Shashank's calling you.
- Okay.

1642
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:21,250
Show me Cam 2 feed, I have a doubt.

1643
01:36:23,666 --> 01:36:24,708
But he never listens..

1644
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,833
- Sharon, Shashank's looking for you.
- Okay.

1645
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:31,416
Yeah, so... why don't you talk to you?

1646
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:35,416
- Madam, Shashank sir's looking for you.
- Yeah.

1647
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:46,208
- Shashank, you were looking for me.
- Sit.

1648
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:54,541
Ms. Sharon Pinto, this is not done.

1649
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:57,000
I am sorry, but what happened?

1650
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,875
You tell me...

1651
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,458
you should know.

1652
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:04,458
Seriously Shashank, I don't know.

1653
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:15,083
5.2... Just imagine.

1654
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:17,958
5.2!

1655
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,666
Highest TRP records for your show.

1656
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:23,500
- Your show is a blockbuster, Sharon.
- God, you killed me.

1657
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,625
Hang on, there's good news.

1658
01:37:26,125 --> 01:37:28,250
After you finish shooting for the
remaining two episodes of this show..

1659
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:29,916
- ..you're being transferred to Delhi.
- What?

1660
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:30,875
Yes.

1661
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:32,583
You're being promoted.

1662
01:37:33,083 --> 01:37:34,375
Looking at your talent, our top bosses..

1663
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:39,833
..want you to quit entertainment
and join mainstream news.

1664
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:42,916
They think you're meant
for more serious stuff.

1665
01:37:43,416 --> 01:37:46,333
- Serious journalism.
- Wow.

1666
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:49,083
- Excited.
- Super excited.

1667
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:51,833
Me too.

1668
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,625
I am so happy for you, Sharon.

1669
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:57,500
Thank you so much, Shashank.

1670
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,833
I came here with zero experience.

1671
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:04,208
And all this couldn't have been
possible without your support.

1672
01:38:04,708 --> 01:38:06,541
Well, a intelligent man rightly said.

1673
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:07,875
Let things happening the way they are.

1674
01:38:08,375 --> 01:38:10,708
Just relax and go with the flow.

1675
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:12,708
Time for celenbration.

1676
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:17,291
- Hey guys, where's the cake?
- What?

1677
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:19,708
Oh, my God.

1678
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:23,708
Oh, my God.

1679
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:47,375
Mayuri... I saw the trailer
and song of your new film.

1680
01:38:47,875 --> 01:38:49,458
I really liked it.

1681
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:51,958
Sir, you watched the trailer of my film.

1682
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:54,250
Oh, my God!

1683
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:58,041
Mayuri, you must have heard about..

1684
01:38:58,541 --> 01:39:01,083
..my heroine Kavya Khanna's surgery?

1685
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:03,500
Sir, everyone's heard about it.

1686
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,458
Since she got that done, she's
been giving only one experience.

1687
01:39:06,958 --> 01:39:07,666
Whether she's happy or sad.

1688
01:39:08,166 --> 01:39:09,416
It's hard to know what the scene is.

1689
01:39:09,916 --> 01:39:10,791
Sir, don't mind.

1690
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:15,208
For the last four days Kavya's
face is trending on Twitter.

1691
01:39:15,708 --> 01:39:17,375
And sir, after Mr. Alok Nath..

1692
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,958
..people are making fun of Kavya the most.

1693
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:24,333
I know...

1694
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:29,291
Mayuri, will you replace
Kavya Khanna in my film?

1695
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:31,833
Second lead, parallel.

1696
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,833
Oh my, God.

1697
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:36,791
Sir, it will be an honor.

1698
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:40,375
But Mayuri, I've heard that
you also signed a film..

1699
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:41,791
..with some stupid builder's son.

1700
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:43,500
And you also shot for it.

1701
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,208
But my film should come first.

1702
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:48,541
Sir, actually... I signed that film..

1703
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:51,625
..because I wanted to buy
a flat at Oberoi Springs.

1704
01:39:52,125 --> 01:39:56,708
Sir, you're my senior... but still
I want to tell you something.

1705
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:59,625
It's true that I signed that film.

1706
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:02,583
And it's also true that
we also shot some scenes.

1707
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:05,416
But the biggest truth is that..

1708
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:09,291
..real film is the one that releases.

1709
01:40:09,791 --> 01:40:11,333
- Wow...
- Right, sir? Right?

1710
01:40:11,833 --> 01:40:16,000
A real film is that releases. Fantastic.

1711
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,208
Mayuri, I've decided.

1712
01:40:18,708 --> 01:40:21,416
You're doing my film Airhostess.

1713
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:23,333
Oh my, God!

1714
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:26,750
And trust me... you'll make it really big.

1715
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:29,291
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

1716
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:32,458
Sir, you really made my day.

1717
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:33,833
Yeah, Nandita.

1718
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:36,083
Harsh, you were supposed
to come back today.

1719
01:40:36,583 --> 01:40:39,166
I know, Nandita, but I don't
think it will be possible today.

1720
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:41,166
Where are you?

1721
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:43,458
Of course in my room, where else?

1722
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,583
And what are those voices at the back?

1723
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:48,041
I am sitting with my business associates.

1724
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:52,166
- Would you like to talk to them?
- No, forget it.

1725
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:54,375
Okay then, I'll talk to you later.

1726
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:58,375
Harsh.

1727
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:04,416
Thank you, Mr. Bhatia. Superb.

1728
01:41:04,916 --> 01:41:06,083
I'll send you all the details next week.

1729
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:06,666
Okay.

1730
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:08,041
See you, sir. See you, ma'am.

1731
01:41:08,541 --> 01:41:08,916
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1732
01:41:09,416 --> 01:41:11,708
Let's go.

1733
01:41:12,208 --> 01:41:15,291
- Canary Islands in Spain, sounds exotic.
- Wonderful.

1734
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:18,333
We won't find a better place for our
30th Wedding anniversary celebration.

1735
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:19,583
I agree.

1736
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:23,583
- Mrs. Narang, we're going to rock again.
- Absolutely.

1737
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:30,416
Nandita.

1738
01:41:30,916 --> 01:41:33,500
What's wrong, dear?

1739
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,708
- Is everything fine?
- No.

1740
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:40,375
- What's bothering you?
- Harsh.

1741
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:42,916
What did Harsh do?

1742
01:41:43,416 --> 01:41:46,833
Dad, Harsh is cheating on me.

1743
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:48,500
I've been observing for a long time now.

1744
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,583
But he doesn't seem to stop.

1745
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:55,583
He's just not willing to change.

1746
01:41:59,916 --> 01:42:02,000
Look, dear, I can understand
what you're feeling.

1747
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,333
I understand.

1748
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:08,500
But you must understand one thing.

1749
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,500
This is not a ordinary family.

1750
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,833
We're the Narangs.

1751
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:20,083
And you're the Narang
family daughter-in-law.

1752
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:25,583
Nandita, I am not trying
to justify what Harsh did.

1753
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:29,458
In fact... it's a family...

1754
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:31,458
What do you say?

1755
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:35,000
Family tradition.

1756
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:40,125
Anyway... look at us.

1757
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:41,958
We've been married for 30 years.

1758
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:45,125
There's love, trust...
it's an ideal marriage.

1759
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:47,458
I believe, in fact I am certain..

1760
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:51,750
..that your marriage with
Harsh will be successful too.

1761
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,791
I am sure of that.

1762
01:42:55,291 --> 01:42:58,458
Look, dear. I know my son.

1763
01:42:58,958 --> 01:43:01,166
He loves you a lot.

1764
01:43:01,666 --> 01:43:04,875
Yes. Try to understand one thing.

1765
01:43:05,375 --> 01:43:09,500
We've a huge business,
we've to work really hard.

1766
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,833
And we get... stressed.

1767
01:43:14,333 --> 01:43:16,458
We get stressed.

1768
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:24,250
Whatever happened... was
just means to entertainment.

1769
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,541
Nothing more.

1770
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:32,875
He does come back home to you, doesn't he?

1771
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,875
He does, doesn't he?

1772
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:38,875
Every night he comes back to you.

1773
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:48,291
Nandi, don't try to fix what's not broken.

1774
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:53,500
Now come on. Give me a smile. Come on.

1775
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,583
Give me one of your gorgeous smiles.
Come on.

1776
01:43:58,083 --> 01:43:58,666
Cheer up.

1777
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:00,500
Come on, give me a smile Nandi.

1778
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,541
Look at me and smile. Come on.

1779
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:06,041
Yeah!

1780
01:44:06,541 --> 01:44:10,041
Good.

1781
01:44:20,375 --> 01:44:23,375
"Where has my desires brought me?"

1782
01:44:23,875 --> 01:44:27,166
"It's a deluge of pain."

1783
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:30,958
"Is it the heart making mistakes.."

1784
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:37,916
"or the conspiracy of time."

1785
01:44:38,416 --> 01:44:41,500
There's good news for you.

1786
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,125
I wanted to tell you personally.

1787
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:48,375
And look you invited me home.

1788
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:50,750
You're going to get a handsome appraisal.

1789
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:54,375
You're going to be such a star.

1790
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:58,458
Our clients have loved your presentations.

1791
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:03,791
I can't do this anymore.

1792
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:09,291
- Why?
- Because I feel disgusted.

1793
01:45:09,791 --> 01:45:13,916
I hate myself more than
I ever hated anyone.

1794
01:45:14,416 --> 01:45:17,916
I don't know when I sold my soul too.

1795
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:27,500
I want to go back to London.

1796
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,083
I don't want to do this.

1797
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:36,125
Naazneen.

1798
01:45:36,625 --> 01:45:38,125
You know...

1799
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:41,208
when decisions are
taken so emotionally..

1800
01:45:41,708 --> 01:45:46,000
..they are not decisions,
in fact they are stupidity.

1801
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,458
You're used to a type of lifestyle.

1802
01:45:49,958 --> 01:45:52,333
Luxury is a necessity for you now.

1803
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:54,583
And there's nothing wrong in it.

1804
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:57,500
And you know, in your glamour world..

1805
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,250
..even the biggest stars
have to give 10 retakes.

1806
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:07,666
And you... one take, and money in the bank.

1807
01:46:08,166 --> 01:46:10,625
Ananya, I have decided.

1808
01:46:11,125 --> 01:46:14,625
I can't do this anymore.

1809
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:21,500
Okay.

1810
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,333
Okay.

1811
01:46:25,833 --> 01:46:28,750
I never force anyone.

1812
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,833
You can quit if you want.

1813
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:35,833
It's a free choice world.

1814
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:41,708
But sweetheart...

1815
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:46,166
I've committed your
name and photo to someone.

1816
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:48,208
He's a very important man.

1817
01:46:48,708 --> 01:46:52,000
A foreign diplomat.

1818
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:55,666
This one time, please.

1819
01:46:56,166 --> 01:46:59,666
One last time, for me.

1820
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:05,791
Thanks.

1821
01:47:06,291 --> 01:47:09,416
Sir, we've almost cracked
the match-fixing case.

1822
01:47:09,916 --> 01:47:12,916
Me and my team have gathered evidence..

1823
01:47:13,416 --> 01:47:16,833
..against all the people we had doubts on.

1824
01:47:17,333 --> 01:47:19,750
It includes four bookies, five
cricketers, two umpires..

1825
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,833
..and few other suspects.

1826
01:47:22,333 --> 01:47:24,125
I want to arrest all of them.

1827
01:47:24,625 --> 01:47:27,416
- I need free hand, sir.
- Go ahead, Pranjpe.

1828
01:47:27,916 --> 01:47:28,458
Get them.

1829
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:29,375
- Please..
- Come on.

1830
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:31,166
Don't touch me.

1831
01:47:31,666 --> 01:47:33,000
- Come on.
- Let me go.

1832
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,958
Come on. Come... come on.

1833
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:40,166
Get in.

1834
01:47:40,666 --> 01:47:41,833
Come on. Get in.

1835
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:44,583
Get in... what are you looking at?

1836
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:46,458
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

1837
01:47:46,958 --> 01:47:48,166
Come here.

1838
01:47:48,666 --> 01:47:50,458
Thank you.

1839
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:52,333
- What's your name?
- Akansha.

1840
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:54,041
So sweet.

1841
01:47:54,541 --> 01:47:56,750
- Do you want chocolates?
- Yes.

1842
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:57,666
Thank you, sister.

1843
01:47:58,166 --> 01:47:58,791
What's your name?

1844
01:47:59,291 --> 01:48:01,250
- My name is Sudeepto.
- Sudeepto.

1845
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:03,375
Hello.

1846
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:05,125
- Vignesh Paranjpe.
- Hi.

1847
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:09,000
CBI... Mumbai Branch.

1848
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,041
I'm here to question you
about the match-fixing..

1849
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:15,000
..in SPL Super Premiere league.

1850
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,500
You must come with us.

1851
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,208
Oh, sorry.

1852
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:21,083
You're in the middle of a good event.

1853
01:48:21,583 --> 01:48:24,041
No problem. You can come out
as soon as the event is over.

1854
01:48:24,541 --> 01:48:27,666
Our team is waiting for you.

1855
01:48:28,166 --> 01:48:31,666
Come.

1856
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:39,416
These are some photographs...
of the SPL post-match parties.

1857
01:48:39,916 --> 01:48:42,625
See, there you are.

1858
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:45,958
Look at how you're blending in.

1859
01:48:46,458 --> 01:48:49,083
So you must know all of them.

1860
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:50,541
Just a minute.

1861
01:48:51,041 --> 01:48:57,750
These are... your phone call details.

1862
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:02,208
And we also have a recording
of all your conversations.

1863
01:49:02,708 --> 01:49:04,583
How many runs does one
need to score in a match?

1864
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:07,208
When a particular batsman needs to get out.

1865
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:11,375
Etcetera... etcetera...

1866
01:49:11,875 --> 01:49:15,041
I've also taken their confession.

1867
01:49:15,541 --> 01:49:22,250
Paroma Ghosh, your name is
common in all their statements.

1868
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:26,500
Even Akhil Sood's been
interrogated in Delhi.

1869
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,041
He's break too.

1870
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:35,083
If there's anything you want to say
in your defense, then... you can.

1871
01:49:35,583 --> 01:49:38,458
Please feel free.

1872
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:42,458
Can I make a call?

1873
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:46,458
Sure.

1874
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,500
I doubt if the one you
consider your life-life..

1875
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,166
..can get you out of this game.

1876
01:49:55,666 --> 01:49:58,375
Pinaki Chatterjee has already left india.

1877
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:02,833
He's absconding.

1878
01:50:03,333 --> 01:50:05,125
Paroma Ghosh..

1879
01:50:05,625 --> 01:50:09,125
..you are under arrest.

1880
01:50:17,916 --> 01:50:21,375
- You must have heard about Paroma.
- Yeah.

1881
01:50:21,875 --> 01:50:26,250
- About to read the news?
- Yes.

1882
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,750
Sharon, I just called to tell you...
it's a tough world..

1883
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:33,666
..but you have to be brave.

1884
01:50:34,166 --> 01:50:37,750
Let's not judge anyone.

1885
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:41,875
- You take care, and be strong.
- Yeah.

1886
01:50:42,375 --> 01:50:45,875
Bye.

1887
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:50,750
And the biggest breaking news of the hour.

1888
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:52,625
Calendar Girl Paroma Ghosh..

1889
01:50:53,125 --> 01:50:55,083
..has been arrested under the charges
of betting and spot-fixing..

1890
01:50:55,583 --> 01:50:56,500
- ..in the Cricket league.
- Happy now?

1891
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,791
It's being said that
Paroma hatched this plan..

1892
01:50:59,291 --> 01:51:03,041
..along with her boyfriend and
business partner Pinaki Chatterjee.

1893
01:51:03,541 --> 01:51:05,583
Paroma is in police custody.

1894
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:10,958
But her boyfriend is at large.

1895
01:51:11,458 --> 01:51:13,500
Get in.

1896
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,958
Where did you come from?

1897
01:51:16,458 --> 01:51:17,583
Madam...

1898
01:51:18,083 --> 01:51:20,083
What did you do?

1899
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:21,958
What did you do?

1900
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:23,083
Tell us...

1901
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:25,000
You look from a good family.

1902
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,875
And this hour's biggest breaking
news is from Mumbai's glamour world.

1903
01:51:29,375 --> 01:51:31,041

1904
01:51:31,541 --> 01:51:33,666
Has been arrested by Mumbai's CBI branch.

1905
01:51:34,166 --> 01:51:36,958
Paroma has been charged with betting..

1906
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:41,041
..and spot-fixing along with her boyfriend.

1907
01:51:41,541 --> 01:51:44,375
- It was not my fault.
- I see.

1908
01:51:44,875 --> 01:51:46,708
Who's Paroma Ghosh? It's you, right?

1909
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:47,458
Yes.

1910
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:51,458
Your bail's been made.
Get ready and come out.

1911
01:52:02,541 --> 01:52:03,875
You will call us to Mumbai.

1912
01:52:04,375 --> 01:52:05,291
And you did?

1913
01:52:05,791 --> 01:52:06,750
You will be famous.

1914
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:08,541
You're famous now.

1915
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:11,041
You made us feel really proud.

1916
01:52:11,541 --> 01:52:15,833
So proud... that your mother can't
even stand at her own balcony.

1917
01:52:16,333 --> 01:52:18,458
Entire Kolkata's talking about her, father.

1918
01:52:18,958 --> 01:52:20,375
Do us a favor.

1919
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:23,875
Don't ever show us your face again.

1920
01:52:24,375 --> 01:52:26,125
Got it! Come, father.

1921
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:27,500
- Let's go.
- Father.

1922
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,500
Let's go.

1923
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:08,000
- Hello.
- Hello, Paroma.

1924
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:11,541
But... why me for a reality show?

1925
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:12,791
Why me?

1926
01:53:13,291 --> 01:53:16,750
Because... our research says that
people want to know about you.

1927
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:19,708
Right now, you're more popular..

1928
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:22,833
..that you were after
becoming the Calendar girl.

1929
01:53:23,333 --> 01:53:27,500
You've been trending on
Social media for two weeks.

1930
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:33,000
And you know... our show only
takes controversial people.

1931
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,875
You even know the format of this show.

1932
01:53:35,375 --> 01:53:37,041
You have to live in a house for 10 weeks.

1933
01:53:37,541 --> 01:53:39,708
Cameras will keep an eye on you 24/7.

1934
01:53:40,208 --> 01:53:43,083
These 10 weeks will change your life.

1935
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:47,416
And our channel is prepared
to pay you 5 million..

1936
01:53:47,916 --> 01:53:50,041
..to participate on this show.

1937
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:51,583
This is the platform...

1938
01:53:52,083 --> 01:53:54,625
where you can convey your
truth, everything that happened..

1939
01:53:55,125 --> 01:53:59,250
..with you in the cricket
league, your jail experiences.

1940
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:04,000
You can share all of it with the country.

1941
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:09,250
Ms. Paroma, life is giving
you a second chance.

1942
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:11,416
Trust me.

1943
01:54:11,916 --> 01:54:15,416
Yes, Paroma.

1944
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:50,333
Hello, Inzamam. I want
to come back to London.

1945
01:54:50,833 --> 01:54:53,583
I am missing you a lot.

1946
01:54:54,083 --> 01:54:58,208
I admit I made some mistakes.

1947
01:54:58,708 --> 01:55:04,208
But I believe you will forgive me.

1948
01:55:04,708 --> 01:55:07,875
I want to start a new
life all over, Inzamam.

1949
01:55:08,375 --> 01:55:11,583
Hello, are you listening Inzamam.

1950
01:55:12,083 --> 01:55:13,750
Hello, Inzamam.

1951
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:18,125
Hello.

1952
01:55:18,625 --> 01:55:22,291
Don't try to be pious now.

1953
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:25,541
I've already forgotten about you.

1954
01:55:26,041 --> 01:55:27,666
And buried you.

1955
01:55:28,166 --> 01:55:29,125
Hang up, you b***

1956
01:55:29,625 --> 01:55:33,125
Get lost!

1957
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:07,458
Mr. Dmitri.

1958
01:56:09,583 --> 01:56:13,083
Come in, darling. Come in!

1959
01:56:23,708 --> 01:56:25,083
Take a drink, darling. Take a drink.

1960
01:56:25,583 --> 01:56:29,083
It'll be good for you. Drink. Drink.

1961
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,208
Oh, you're my darling.

1962
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:46,416
Drink, darling. Drink.

1963
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:50,416
Cheers to us, to life.

1964
01:56:54,541 --> 01:56:58,083
Are you only going to dance...
or do something?

1965
01:56:58,583 --> 01:57:01,208
Or will I have to do everything?

1966
01:57:01,708 --> 01:57:04,541
What?

1967
01:57:05,041 --> 01:57:08,541
Will you be able to perform?

1968
01:57:12,625 --> 01:57:15,500
Four pill...

1969
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,583
It's just for you, and me... and this pill.

1970
01:57:21,083 --> 01:57:24,583
- Four.
- Okay, I'll get ready and come.

1971
01:58:29,083 --> 01:58:34,833
Mr. Dmitri, get up.

1972
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:38,833
Hello, Mr. Dmitri, please get up.

1973
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:48,500
Yes. Hello...

1974
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,541
I'm calling from room no.530.

1975
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:52,833
There's a medical emergency over here.

1976
01:58:53,333 --> 01:58:53,833
Please come fast.

1977
01:58:54,333 --> 01:58:58,375
Fast.

1978
01:58:58,875 --> 01:59:02,375
Oh, God!

1979
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:24,791
- I am so sorry.
- Sorry.

1980
01:59:29,333 --> 01:59:30,500
Ma'am. Ma'am.

1981
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,500
Excuse me, ma'am, your phone.

1982
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:13,875
I believe Paroma and Naazneen...

1983
02:00:14,375 --> 02:00:19,208
And when something happens with them..

1984
02:00:19,708 --> 02:00:20,291
Calendar girls..

1985
02:00:20,791 --> 02:00:25,333
Wearing skimpy clothes doesn't matter..

1986
02:00:25,833 --> 02:00:28,000
This debate will never end.

1987
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:30,916
But today we're out of time.

1988
02:00:31,416 --> 02:00:36,666
But before I go, I want to say...
every coin has two sides.

1989
02:00:37,166 --> 02:00:40,500
I don't think there's anything wrong
with a platform like Calendar girls.

1990
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,375
I was a Calendar girl myself.

1991
02:00:43,875 --> 02:00:48,041
Mayuri Chauhan, who's making a
successful film career now..

1992
02:00:48,541 --> 02:00:50,458
..was a Colander girl as well.

1993
02:00:50,958 --> 02:00:53,750
Nandita Menon, whose also a Calendar girl..

1994
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,625
..is happily married today.

1995
02:00:57,125 --> 02:00:58,208
Rather than platform or tracks..

1996
02:00:58,708 --> 02:01:01,458
..we should concentrate
more on individual choices.

1997
02:01:01,958 --> 02:01:05,416
Life is all about the individual
choices you make, isn't it?

1998
02:01:05,916 --> 02:01:07,375
This is Sharon Pinto signing off.

1999
02:01:07,875 --> 02:01:11,166
See you next week, with a new topic.

2000
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:15,166
On 'Badi Behas' (THE BIG DEBATE).

2001
02:01:31,083 --> 02:01:33,583
I still can't believe...

2002
02:01:34,083 --> 02:01:37,416
That Naazneen's body was
in a morgue for 10 days.

2003
02:01:37,916 --> 02:01:40,958
And no one claimed the body.

2004
02:01:41,458 --> 02:01:42,625
It's just so inhuman.

2005
02:01:43,125 --> 02:01:46,666
That's so sad, we lost a good friend.

2006
02:01:47,166 --> 02:01:48,500
I am so sorry, Paroma.

2007
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,291
When you were going through
everything, I was stressed myself.

2008
02:01:52,791 --> 02:01:55,500
I couldn't come to your aide. I am sorry.

2009
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,000
The more the crowd, the
lonelier a person feels.

2010
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,666
This is Mumbai City.

2011
02:02:04,166 --> 02:02:07,500
No one lends you a shoulder to shed a tear.

2012
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,625
They wait till you're dead.

2013
02:02:12,125 --> 02:02:15,000
"Something that I left behind."

2014
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:18,416
"Something's broken."

2015
02:02:18,916 --> 02:02:26,875
"I guess even God's upset with us."

2016
02:02:27,375 --> 02:02:30,250
"Where has my desires brought me?"

2017
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:33,666
"It's a deluge of pain."

2018
02:02:34,166 --> 02:02:37,250
"Is it the heart making mistakes.."

2019
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:41,250
"or the conspiracy of time."

2020
02:02:54,583 --> 02:02:57,500
"Where has my desires brought me?"

2021
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,500
"It's a deluge of pain."

2022
02:03:07,833 --> 02:03:11,500
"These desires..."

2023
02:03:11,524 --> 02:03:27,524
<font color="#ffff80"><b>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</b></font>
