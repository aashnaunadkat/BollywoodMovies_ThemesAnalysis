1
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:43,331
'Children are humans too.'

2
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:46,687
'They are innocent and truthful
than elders.'

3
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:51,571
'They don't have a wall of cunningness
around them.'

4
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:54,421
'For their betterment we need...

5
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,304
...to educate them in school...

6
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,795
...they should get such a world...

7
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,850
...where's there's love and affection.'

8
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:06,979
'Guru Ravindranath Tagore.'

9
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:14,455
"Beloved is in every color of heart."

10
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,393
"He is very stone hearted."

11
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:30,356
"The color of henna."

12
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:37,302
"Beloved has gone abroad."

13
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:45,167
"He hasn't sent any letter."

14
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:54,573
"How can I live without you?"

15
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,024
(Horn blares)

16
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:02,969
Come here... Come on. Come here...

17
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:11,360
Where is Dulari Devi School?

18
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,454
Take a left turn and then a right turn...

19
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:17,963
...you'll find a well...

20
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:20,171
...the Dulari Devi School is
just opposite to it.

21
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:22,766
Do you belong to the same village?
-We belong to the same school.

22
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:25,036
Is it? Will you take me there?

23
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,130
In your car?
-Yes.

24
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:29,793
Sit inside. Come on.

25
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,802
Tell me your names.

26
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:47,940
Avdesh.
-Hari.

27
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:48,868
Gorak.

28
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,349
My name is Neha.

29
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:54,376
Don't you have school today?

30
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:57,048
I have, but I don't go.
-Why?

31
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,700
The master is very shrew.

32
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,194
He thrashes us badly.

33
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:04,214
Hereafter, you have to
go to school every day.

34
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,335
I have come to build
a big school in your village.

35
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:09,346
Is it?

36
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,331
Will you drink water?

37
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:18,147
Here.

38
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:42,215
It is fun to sit your car.

39
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:44,658
Where's the cool breeze coming from?

40
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,071
From here.

41
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:52,124
(Laughs)

42
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:56,145
Stop the car... drop us here...
drop us here.

43
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,239
You'll find the school ahead.
We're going.

44
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,740
How does it open? Tell me.

45
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,929
It opened. Let's go.
-Hey, stop.

46
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:10,104
Let's go. Let's go.
-Hey, come on out.

47
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:13,283
Avdesh.

48
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:24,541
Do you want chocolates?

49
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,931
Wait, I'll come.

50
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:34,955
Come.

51
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,721
Is it for me?
-Yes, it is for you.

52
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:47,635
Give me one.
-Okay, I'll give you.

53
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:52,144
This is for you and this for you.

54
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,888
Chocolates.
-Yes.

55
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,528
You also have one.

56
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:02,810
Here are some books for you.

57
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,019
Take a left and you'll find the school.
-Let's go.

58
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:08,332
Hey?

59
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,023
Hey, look... the car is so nice.

60
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,767
2 x 2 = 4!
-It is so nice.

61
00:07:19,997 --> 00:07:23,019
I think someone has come.
-2 x 3 = 6.

62
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:26,723
Where's the headmaster? Let's go.

63
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:33,741
(Indistinct chatter)

64
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,120
She is going in.

65
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,308
2 x 7 = 14.

66
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,092
Greetings.
-Greetings.

67
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,538
Who do you want to meet?
-I want to meet the headmaster.

68
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,578
He is having bath. Look there.

69
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:47,942
Hail Goddess Ganges!
Hail Goddess Ganges!

70
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:52,981
Hail Goddess Ganges!
Hail Goddess Ganges!

71
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:54,357
Come, let's go.

72
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:57,592
Hey children, go to your classrooms!
-Let's go.

73
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,113
They are children of this village...
come on.

74
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,042
Come, please have a seat.

75
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:06,903
You sit here and I'll
call the headmaster.

76
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,419
Have a seat. I'll be back.

77
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,071
2 x 6=12

78
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:14,886
2 x 7 =14

79
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,145
Headmaster!

80
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:41,098
Hiralal, what's the matter?
-There's a woman to meet you.

81
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,035
Yes, I spoke to the collector.

82
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:43,996
Is she here?

83
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,837
Yes.
-Hurry up, give me the towel.

84
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:47,126
Here.

85
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:57,411
Madam, he's the headmaster.

86
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:59,593
Mr. Ramnarayan Jha.
-Greetings.

87
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:02,453
Greetings, my name is Neha Malini.

88
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,244
Neha Malini?

89
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,496
I've heard about Hema Malini.
You are Neha Malini.

90
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,283
Wonderful. Great. Great.

91
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:12,537
Have a seat. (Chuckles)

92
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,918
So, you've come from Delhi.
-Yes.

93
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,545
I was in US two months ago,
then I came to Delhi...

94
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:20,889
...then here.
-US?

95
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:23,301
America.
-America?

96
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:26,970
Oh, the same America,
where it is night and here it is day?

97
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,945
Hiralal, get two teas.

98
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:30,333
I've ordered for it.

99
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:31,567
Special? Okay.
-Yes.

100
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:37,957
What is this? School map?
-Yes.

101
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,978
Wonderful. It is nice.

102
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:43,605
It is very big too.

103
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,516
Like King Akbar built Taj Mahal...

104
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,504
...you've come to build a school.

105
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,068
Taj Mahal was not built by Akbar,
but by Shah Jahan.

106
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,725
(Laughs)

107
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:57,755
Yes, but King Akbar thought about it.

108
00:09:57,887 --> 00:09:59,770
What say?
King Akbar thought about it, right?

109
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:00,964
Yes...
-Absolutely.

110
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:04,917
What are you doing here?
Go and teach the children.

111
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,097
(Clears throat)

112
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:10,331
King Akbar thought about it.

113
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:12,067
Tea...

114
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:15,417
Here...

115
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,420
Don't you study?
-No.

116
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:19,555
I make tea for the teachers.

117
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,246
Yes. He makes nice tea.

118
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,266
You have it... Here, have tea.

119
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:30,012
Hey! Hey! Go away!

120
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,267
(Chuckles)

121
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,737
Master, after toiling very hard
and taking help from many people...

122
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,448
...I have arranged for this fund.
-Okay.

123
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,797
You have to make a trust
of local people here.

124
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:46,602
The school building
will be built in their supervision.

125
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,732
Yes, I had spoken the collector.

126
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,286
He said the trust must
consist of five members.

127
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:55,447
I've spoken to the village chief,
there's an old minister of our village...

128
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:58,326
...Mr. Kailash... he's very educated.

129
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:00,483
Moreover, I am present here.

130
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,402
And two masters...

131
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:06,177
Okay, if you feel,
call the others tomorrow.

132
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:07,360
I'll come tomorrow.

133
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:09,349
Okay, as you wish.
-Okay.

134
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,085
I shall leave.
-Please, come.

135
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,549
Ganga!

136
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:19,640
What is going on there?
Move them from here. -Hey, go away!

137
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,528
Hey, get down!

138
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:25,335
Master, I am getting down.
-Do you think it belongs to you?

139
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:27,528
Hey, how dare you hit a stone!

140
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:32,210
I will thrash you to pulp.
I will teach you a lesson.

141
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,812
You scoundrel.

142
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:37,168
I will debar you from the school.

143
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:38,986
Scoundrel, escaped.

144
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:42,236
Ms. Neha, you don't worry.
I'll catch hold of him at home.

145
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:45,447
He will fall on your feet and apologize.
-No need.

146
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:50,151
Master, I think some children
don't come to school at all.

147
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:52,484
I met three children from the school...

148
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,461
...they came till here
showing me the way...

149
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:56,947
...but didn't come inside the school.

150
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:59,955
Ms. Neha Malini,
children don't come to study here.

151
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,582
They come here to play.

152
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,675
You tell me their names,
I'll get them from their homes.

153
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:09,542
They said their names were
Hari, Gorak, and Avdesh.

154
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:11,942
Hari, Gorak, and Avdesh?

155
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,580
Where did you find those three guys?

156
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:17,257
Why?
-Are you alright?

157
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,020
Yes.

158
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,145
Hope those guys didn't harm you.
-No.

159
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:24,132
Those three guys are criminals.

160
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:26,269
What are you saying, Master?
-I'm telling the truth.

161
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,083
They were children aged 12-14 years.

162
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:31,327
Ms. Neha, they've created chaos
in the entire area.

163
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:34,042
They've murdered four people.
-Murder?

164
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:36,227
Yes...
-Ms. Neha, forget it.

165
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:38,030
We'll concentrate on the school.

166
00:12:52,069 --> 00:13:03,043
(Phone ringing)

167
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:06,036
Dad?
(Dad)-How are you, my dear?

168
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:08,682
Have you reached the village? 
-Yes, I've arrived.

169
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:10,949
What is the name of the village? 
-Birva.

170
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:14,885
I know you are very excited
as this was your dream.

171
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:22,885
Dad, I want to celebrate my birthday
with you and mom this year.

172
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,763
Dear, you know, it is not possible.

173
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:32,709
I am sorry, dear. You didn't get our
love together, but got it separately.

174
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:36,319
But fulfill your dream for
which you went to that village.

175
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,334
You are happy, I am happy.
Take care.

176
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,572
I am happy, dad.

177
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:42,226
I love you.

178
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:01,788
(Neha) DM sir, this school is my dream.

179
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,220
And I need your help.
-You are doing a great job.

180
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,179
I met three children on the way.
-Okay.

181
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:13,254
They must be aged 12-13 years.
They were innocent.

182
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:17,795
Then I learnt that they were criminals.

183
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,722
Our police is trying very hard
to nab those three children.

184
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:22,931
You don't worry.

185
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:29,182
Sir, I am not worried about myself.

186
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,128
I am worried for those children.

187
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:38,642
I was a software engineer in America.
I left everything and have come here.

188
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:41,899
I will finish my work and leave.

189
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:55,318
(Indistinct chatter)

190
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:12,386
Greetings, madam. Please, come.

191
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:15,585
Look there. They've killed someone.
Please, come.

192
00:15:18,342 --> 00:15:20,515
Please, come.
-Who did they kill?

193
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:21,403
Please come, madam.

194
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:27,169
Take him out. Come on.

195
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:32,252
Please, come.

196
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:46,916
If you get any news about
those three guys, let us know.

197
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:52,026
Tell their parents to come
and meet me in the police station.

198
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,311
Once if I get hold of them.

199
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:58,795
Listen...

200
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,799
Who is this madam?
-She's here to build a school.

201
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:06,815
Really?

202
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,541
Pick up the dead body.
Pick up the dead body!

203
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:14,178
Careful...
-Come on, pick it up.

204
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:16,722
Move aside... Move aside.

205
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,813
Can't you hear me?
-Brother, move.

206
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:24,205
Who killed them?
-Those three guys killed him.

207
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:27,331
They met you yesterday.
He was constable Mahadev.

208
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:31,388
They killed him too. Let's go, headmaster
must be waiting for you. Come on.

209
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:35,048
Ms. Neha, come.
-Greetings, Ms. Neha.

210
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:38,597
Those three guys killed the constable.
-I heard the news.

211
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:40,441
I am waiting for you since morning.

212
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:42,865
I have summoned
the village chief and Mr. Kailash.

213
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:44,451
Please, come.
-Let's go.

214
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:45,279
Please, come.

215
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:46,686
Mr. Kailash.

216
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,164
Greetings.
-He is educated.

217
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,353
I told you about him, didn't I?
-Yes.

218
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:51,907
He is the chief.

219
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,881
Greetings.
-Greetings.

220
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,586
I help as much as possible.

221
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,210
But this village is in darkness.

222
00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:59,341
There's darkness in this village.

223
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:01,893
You build the school...

224
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,686
...then children will get educated.

225
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:07,223
We are ready to support you.
-Yes.

226
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:11,851
Ms. Neha,
the trustees are in front of you.

227
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:13,773
(Chuckles)

228
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,797
This file contains all the details.

229
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:19,247
You read it and sign it.

230
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:21,955
Since when those three are doing crime?
-Who?

231
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,740
The one who murdered
the constable today.

232
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,372
From four to five months.

233
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,612
You tell me,
where do we have to sign?

234
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:33,150
Master, I am talking
about those three guys.

235
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:39,224
I wanted to ask you something.

236
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,948
What is the estimate of this project?

237
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:44,588
Two crores.

238
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:46,388
Two crores?

239
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:50,300
Two...

240
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:54,466
I am going to Patna
to meet the minister.

241
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,653
Until then you prepare the tender.

242
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,743
We've elected the contractor.

243
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:04,124
Paras... he is very honest,
respectable, and intelligent contractor.

244
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,830
You are Hariya's mother, right?

245
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:10,489
What was his enmity with the constable?

246
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:13,451
No sir, I don't know anything.
-You don't know.

247
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,739
Your child commits a murder
and you don't know anything.

248
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:18,624
You are Gorak's father, right?
-Yes.

249
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:20,984
What was his enmity with him?

250
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:24,776
No one will speak up.
You scoundrels.

251
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:26,704
You?

252
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,320
Everyone has joined hands in it.

253
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,202
You have begot a goon in the village?
Will you scare us?

254
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:45,439
Good night, madam.

255
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:49,785
Good evening.
I am Neha Malini from NGO.

256
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,959
I am Bansi.
I take care of the police station.

257
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:54,556
I have to the school
for school building.

258
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:55,447
Oh.

259
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:57,681
Please come.

260
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:01,374
(Clears throat)

261
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:02,276
Sir, is the tea ready?

262
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,916
Salute madam.
-Greetings, madam.

263
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,107
Get tea for her.

264
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:09,632
I'll get it right away.
-Give it to her.

265
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,673
Sir, I've washed it.
-Then go and dry it.

266
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:12,286
Yes.

267
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,992
Get it... Keep it.
-Here, madam.

268
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,507
Madam, have it.

269
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:23,289
I heard you met those
three guys on the way.

270
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:25,750
Yes, they dropped me till the school.

271
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,392
People who are sitting outside
are their parents.

272
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:30,808
Mother, father of criminals.

273
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,640
Nonsense people.

274
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:35,064
Hey, tell madam how many
murderers they've committed.

275
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:36,535
Four...
-Four.

276
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:38,724
Today was the fifth.

277
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:42,463
He was our constable. They
killed him by drowning him in a well.

278
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:44,367
You were there.

279
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,127
This area is such.

280
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:50,865
It is not life...
everyone is living in fear.

281
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:56,609
Madam, what do you do?
-I opened a NGO.

282
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:59,242
And this... family?

283
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,935
Father is a scientist
and my mother is a professor.

284
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:10,608
And I... Madam, I am...
Inspector Balkishan.

285
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,515
But sir, for how long will these
three guys keep murdering people?

286
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:17,773
You have to arrest them.

287
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:22,707
I have to do... but how? What?

288
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:24,193
You tell me...

289
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:27,082
...the entire police department
will help you building the school...

290
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,838
Department, will you help her or not?

291
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,243
Sir, we'll help her...
-Madam, we'll help you whenever you want.

292
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:35,884
I shall leave now. I need to go to Patna.
-Okay, madam.

293
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:39,756
Hey, salute madam.
-Greetings, madam.

294
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:41,108
Please come...

295
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:45,217
You go peacefully and return.

296
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:48,956
Look, I'm investigating them.
Be seated, I'll be back.

297
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:53,704
We'll surely nab those guys.

298
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:57,863
You go peacefully and until you return,
I'll finish my enquiry.

299
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,309
Okay... I shall leave.
-Please, sit.

300
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,225
(Bird chirping)

301
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:05,850
(Door closed sound)

302
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,530
(Engine start)

303
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:34,361
I think, Paras has done some setting
with the village chief.

304
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:39,232
But boss, it is your right.
The fund is of 2 crores.

305
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:42,579
Is Paras capable enough to do this work?

306
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:44,084
Yes, he is.

307
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:47,162
That's the reason the village
chief didn't call me.

308
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:48,961
Boss, what do we do?

309
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:51,028
(Scoffs)

310
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:56,976
What do we do?
There's only one solution.

311
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,560
Those three little guys.

312
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,861
Find those three little guys.

313
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,134
Talk to them.

314
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,221
They are looking for Ranjan's address.

315
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:17,374
Give them Ranjan's address
and Rs. 2000.

316
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:21,461
Tell them to kill Paras today.

317
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:24,590
Boss, isn't here any other solution?

318
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:29,611
Do you have any other solution?

319
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,832
Tell me... he's talking too much.

320
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:38,611
"Boss, isn't here any other solution?"

321
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,725
Lakhan used to join hands...

322
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:46,239
...with the superiors and take
every contract in the village. -Yes.

323
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:50,367
I joined hands with the school
people and took the contract.

324
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,521
I bribed the trustees saying,
I'll give them a house.

325
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:54,638
(Gunshot)

326
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:56,973
(Groans)
-Hey...

327
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,338
Lallan?

328
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:04,350
What happened to you? What?

329
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,253
What happened to you, Lallan?

330
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,891
Hey, who shot him?

331
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:17,367
Hey! Hey! Who is it?

332
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:21,640
Who is it? Hey!

333
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,477
Hey, who's firing? Hey...

334
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:28,856
Hey! Hey!

335
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,674
Come out!

336
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:34,098
(Gunshot)
-(Groans)

337
00:24:04,654 --> 00:24:11,491
Greetings. Wow...
all the trustees are present here.

338
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,004
I heard that those
three guys killed Paras.

339
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:26,731
Those three guys are very mischievous,
dangerous, and crazy guys.

340
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:32,438
Look, you gave the contract
of the school to Paras.

341
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:34,468
Three guys killed him.

342
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:38,440
This village cannot progress without me.

343
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,871
The responsibility of building
a school is on me.

344
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:45,718
(Chuckles)

345
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:51,227
Headmaster, give me the map of
your house. Give me.

346
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,612
I'll make a good one.
Give me. Give me.

347
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,277
(Scoffs)

348
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:04,423
You also give it to me.
You show me yours.

349
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:12,491
You don't have one?
Give it to me.

350
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:17,902
Uncle, don't you have one?

351
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:24,589
Have faith. I'll make a good one.
-I know.

352
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:30,204
I'll give you a good one.

353
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:33,722
Let's go.
-Let's go, boss.

354
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:51,595
(Sighs)

355
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:55,567
(Horn blares)

356
00:25:57,374 --> 00:26:05,761
(Indistinct chatter)

357
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:10,372
I've read that cold drinks
are unhealthy.

358
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:12,349
Everything is harmful
if you do it excess.

359
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:15,199
I do everything in excess.

360
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:18,186
Do you know when I am thirsty...

361
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,818
...I drink cold drink instead of water?

362
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:23,020
It is a very bad habit.

363
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:24,673
I need an approval for
the school building.

364
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,031
I have given you the approval.
Look at this.

365
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:29,225
Look at this. The file is ready.

366
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,106
Thank you, sir.

367
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,145
Shall I tell you the truth?
I failed in eighth grade.

368
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:42,464
But by Lord's blessings,
I am the education minister.

369
00:26:42,694 --> 00:26:44,401
But I have something lacking.

370
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,021
A lacking that keeps pinching me within.

371
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:51,848
Do you know what it is?
I am an illiterate.

372
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,425
I am uneducated... but I wish that...

373
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:59,061
...the children of our state should study
well and become IAS and IPS officers.

374
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:02,759
They should serve the society
like you are doing. Am I right?

375
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,183
Look, you've already
taken a step towards it.

376
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:08,737
Master, I've bought chocolates.

377
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:10,790
Distribute it to the children.
-Give him.

378
00:27:12,973 --> 00:27:15,423
Headmaster, they were writing on
the wall with a charcoal.

379
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,289
I caught them red-handed
and brought them here.

380
00:27:17,322 --> 00:27:20,561
Okay, you go... I will handle them.
You come here. Come here.

381
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:23,542
What were you doing, idiots?
What were you doing?

382
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,828
Will you write with charcoal on the wall?
You've become mischievous.

383
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:29,993
(Wailing)
-Will you write with charcoal on the wall?

384
00:27:30,037 --> 00:27:33,133
Will you do so much mischief?
Fools, will you do it again? -Master...

385
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,356
It is wrong to punish
children like this.

386
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:39,437
Ms. Neha, you tell me... he was
writing on the wall with charcoal.

387
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:41,926
Is it a good thing to write on the walls
with charcoal?

388
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,527
No, you tell me.

389
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,979
Ms. Neha, these two guys should be
rusticated from the school. -Why?

390
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,475
Ms. Neha, those three criminals...

391
00:27:49,722 --> 00:27:52,525
...he is Avdesh's brother
and he is Gorak's brother.

392
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:56,447
Do you want them to become criminals like
them after being rusticated from school?

393
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:02,902
Master, minister has given approval
for the school building.

394
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:04,889
This is good news. Wow.

395
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:09,066
We'll do the paperwork with
the contractor that you've approved.

396
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:11,016
I'll call Lakhan today.

397
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:15,780
Lakhan?
But last time you said it was Paras.

398
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:17,950
Paras was murdered.
-Murdered?

399
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:22,660
Yes, those three guys killed him.
Their brothers.

400
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,824
What is your name?

401
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,419
Mahesh.
-Manikant.

402
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,880
Do they three meet you?

403
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:40,866
They meet us sometimes.
They are going to Patna today.

404
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:45,213
Why Patna?
-To look for Poonam.

405
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:50,997
Who is Poonam?
-Avdesh's bride.

406
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:55,181
(Emotional music)

407
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:11,043
Are you Avdesh's mother?

408
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,537
Greetings. My name is Neha.

409
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:21,547
I want to talk to you about Avdesh.

410
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,849
You know that police is
looking for them, don't you?

411
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:34,451
If they nab them,
they'll thrash them brutally.

412
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:36,716
They'll send them to jail forever.

413
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:39,090
I've heard lot of threats till now.

414
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:42,166
Your threats make no difference
to my son.

415
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:48,259
(Bird chirping)

416
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:52,002
Believe me,
I'm not here to threaten you.

417
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,743
I want to save those children.

418
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:58,228
If possible,
I want to give them a good life.

419
00:29:59,283 --> 00:30:02,711
Don't you wish your son to get
educated and become a good man?

420
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:08,290
(Bird chirping)

421
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,069
(Bird chirping)

422
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:23,845
Sit here.

423
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:31,277
(Indistinct chatter)

424
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:55,862
(Bird chirping)

425
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:13,877
Five months ago, Avdesh ran away
from home after fighting with me.

426
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,165
He never returned home.

427
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:28,126
Mahesh told me that
he meets him sometimes.

428
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:40,751
We didn't beget nasty children.

429
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:43,271
They have become goons.

430
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:45,983
(Sniffles)

431
00:31:54,423 --> 00:31:55,773
Everything was alright.

432
00:31:57,768 --> 00:32:00,972
It was during Avdesh's wedding.

433
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:13,022
"In tender age, she got married."

434
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:19,180
"I was innocent and beloved was naive."

435
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:32,896
"What trouble I've landed into?
He doesn't understand anything."

436
00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:42,630
"Beloved is very mischievous,
what do I do?"

437
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:51,206
"Beloved is very mischievous,
what do I do?"

438
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:59,287
"Beloved is very mischievous,
what do I do?"

439
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:07,193
"Beloved is very mischievous,
what do I do? What do I do?"

440
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:15,031
"I'm 12 years old and I got married."

441
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:20,761
"I'm 12 years old and I got married."

442
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:24,247
"I'm 12 years old and I got married."

443
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:29,423
"Beloved, I'm 12 years
old and I got married."

444
00:33:29,503 --> 00:33:33,369
"Beloved."

445
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:42,234
"Beloved went ahead me.
What do I do?"

446
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:46,519
"Beloved went ahead me.
What do I do?"

447
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:50,383
"Beloved is very mischievous.
What do I do?"

448
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:58,748
"Beloved is very mischievous.
What do I do? What do I do?"

449
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:05,978
"When I was 15 years old,
they bid farewell to me."

450
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:15,424
"When I was 15 years old,
they bid farewell to me."

451
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:20,553
"Beloved, when I was 15 years old,
they bid farewell to me."

452
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:23,084
"Beloved."

453
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:29,235
"Beloved calls out for his mother.
What do I do?"

454
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:33,344
"Beloved calls out for his mother.
What do I do?"

455
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:37,708
"Beloved calls out for his mother.
What do I do?" -Let's go.

456
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:41,451
"Beloved is very mischievous.
What do I do?" -Come on, hurry up.

457
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:49,045
"Beloved is very mischievous.
What do I do?" -Hey, come on. Come on!

458
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,140
"What do I do?"
-Come on!

459
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,707
Take this.

460
00:35:16,134 --> 00:35:19,579
It is more than Rs. 10,000.
Give back Poonam.

461
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,968
(Spitting)

462
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:24,785
You delayed.

463
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:28,225
We sold Poonam and took the money.

464
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:33,332
What are you watching?
We've already sold her.

465
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:36,435
You can't do anything now.
-How could you sell her!

466
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,552
How could you sell her!
How dare you!

467
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,275
How dare you!
-You argue with me!

468
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:45,231
(Wailing)

469
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:47,287
Your father has taken loan from us.

470
00:35:49,153 --> 00:35:52,559
Tell him to repay
the loan at the earliest.

471
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:55,440
If not, we'll sell you too.

472
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:01,704
(Spitting)

473
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,520
Rama Shankar is strange man.

474
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,228
He has to pay loan and...

475
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,773
...he fixed his daughter's marriage
with our son.

476
00:36:27,164 --> 00:36:30,453
This means, can he abduct Poonam?

477
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,802
Will he sell her anywhere?

478
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,889
Even you have to repay him loan.

479
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:39,599
Do you know,
Raghuveer is eyeing your son now?

480
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:45,568
Yes, these days, Raghuveer's men
are roaming near our crops. -Yes.

481
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,492
After we harvest lentil crops,
we'll sow potatoes.

482
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:54,210
There's lot of advantage in potatoes.

483
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:59,799
We'll repay the loan.
We'll repay the loan.

484
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:09,544
We'll repay the loan...
We'll repay the loan...

485
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,162
Eat food.

486
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:28,987
(Horse neighing)

487
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:31,165
Hey, get it down... careful.

488
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:37,919
(Indistinct chatter)

489
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:41,260
(Cycle bell ringing)

490
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:05,829
Raghuveer has sent me to you.

491
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,653
He has asked me to get the money.

492
00:38:09,808 --> 00:38:11,443
The lentil crops are going
to be harvested.

493
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:13,718
Give us one more month's time.

494
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:17,262
Your boy keeps roaming here and there.

495
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:19,677
Shall I talk about him?

496
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,757
He will get a job.
He'll get Rs. 10,000.

497
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:24,717
He'll get Rs. 500 monthly as tips.

498
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,184
Raghuveer sold his fiancée.

499
00:38:29,259 --> 00:38:31,459
Now he is eyeing on him.

500
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:34,845
Then I'll take your cattle.

501
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:39,496
If you take cattle,
how will we live?

502
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:48,853
Hey... Do anything you feel like.
You've made our life miserable.

503
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:53,308
The capital amount is Rs. 5000.

504
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:57,110
Interest money is Rs. 4000.
You have to pay Rs. 9000.

505
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,261
Tie the cattle...
I'll come with you tomorrow.

506
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:04,963
You'll get Rs. 10,000.

507
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,282
Mr. Raghuveer will wave off
your interest money.

508
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:11,034
Understood?

509
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:15,355
He'll give Rs. 5000 to your father.
(Chuckles)

510
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,814
I'm going with Dhooman today.

511
00:39:35,696 --> 00:39:36,715
Where are you going?

512
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:42,026
I don't know. I have to
go if I have to save the cattle.

513
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,261
My parents will die
if the cattle are not here.

514
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:47,733
We both will die without you.

515
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,157
We will not let you go.

516
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,975
Let me go... who knows,
I may find Poonam there.

517
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,696
I may even get a chance to free her.

518
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:59,403
We'll find Poonam for you.

519
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,891
Let's go, we'll talk to Dhooman.

520
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:18,626
(Goat bleats)

521
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:23,679
(Goat bleats)

522
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:31,234
Come, I've been waiting for you.

523
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:36,391
Hey Dhooman, go away...
Avdesh will not go with you.

524
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:40,376
You are talking too much?

525
00:40:44,423 --> 00:40:47,112
You!
-Move... why did you hit him?

526
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:50,570
Hey, hit him...
-I am telling you.

527
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:56,611
How dare you!
-Why are you hitting me?

528
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:59,678
Wait...
-I'll teach you a lesson.

529
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,135
Get out!
-Hit him.

530
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:03,185
Get going!
-He'll teach you a lesson.

531
00:41:03,368 --> 00:41:05,057
I'll not spare you.

532
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:19,191
He got saved or we would've
thrashed him to pulp. (Laughs)

533
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:23,962
Avdesh, Raghuveer and his men
are hitting your dad in the farm.

534
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:39,694
(Indistinct chatter)

535
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,503
Father!
-Uncle? Uncle?

536
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,975
Father...
-We'll not spare you, scoundrels!

537
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:05,894
Uncle!
-He killed my father.

538
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:09,124
Father! Father!

539
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:11,894
Scoundrels killed my father.

540
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:26,405
Contractor, how much is it?

541
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:28,463
It is Rs. 25,000.

542
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:31,845
We killed Manohar.

543
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:35,891
I've committed 2-3 murders for you.

544
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,042
I've abducted many children.

545
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:42,366
But I never told
your name to the police.

546
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:47,411
Contractor, it would've been nice
if you would give me more Rs. 25,000.

547
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:04,023
Contractor, don't feel bad...

548
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,563
...I am in need of money.
-Why will I feel bad?

549
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:08,933
Goodbye.

550
00:43:14,454 --> 00:43:18,334
Boss, Raghuveer is becoming greedy.

551
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:21,398
Let he be greedy...

552
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:27,034
...he has been calculating things
these days.

553
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:35,128
Get those three guys to me.

554
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:38,554
You don't worry.
Boss is calling you. Come on.

555
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:44,662
(Barks)

556
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,921
Come on... don't get scared.
Come on.

557
00:44:02,952 --> 00:44:03,871
(Sighs)

558
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:08,802
Bhola...
-Yes, boss?

559
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,159
Where will we find Raghuveer?

560
00:44:11,673 --> 00:44:13,755
He is constructing his shop.

561
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,375
He has got Rs. 50,000.
So, he is doing it.

562
00:44:20,998 --> 00:44:25,837
Come...
-Come, sit. Sit.

563
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,300
(Sighs)

564
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:35,765
Come...
-Yes.

565
00:44:40,508 --> 00:44:41,434
Sit here.

566
00:44:43,937 --> 00:44:44,656
Sit.

567
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:55,223
(Sighs)

568
00:45:05,348 --> 00:45:06,715
Have you killed an ant?

569
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:11,083
You would've killed a rat too?

570
00:45:12,531 --> 00:45:13,812
You would've killed a snake too.

571
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,779
Did you kill it or not? Then?
-Yes, we've killed it.

572
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,491
It is not difficult to kill
a human being.

573
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:29,183
Come here...
-Go... Boss is calling you. Go to him.

574
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:32,938
Come, come.

575
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:35,821
Come, sit here.

576
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:43,606
Killing a human is not a big deal.
You just need to have guts.

577
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:46,723
Bhola.
-Yes, boss?

578
00:45:47,736 --> 00:45:49,149
Give the things to them.

579
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:03,276
Here.

580
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:08,774
You also take...
-Practice in the jungle.

581
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,633
You'll get Raghuveer in his shop.

582
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,891
If you are in need of money...

583
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:21,556
...then don't ask anyone.

584
00:46:22,634 --> 00:46:23,747
Come to me.

585
00:46:25,258 --> 00:46:26,875
Your father died...

586
00:46:28,574 --> 00:46:31,196
...hereafter, I am your father.

587
00:46:34,095 --> 00:46:36,438
We'll get your bride back.

588
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:38,875
Understood?

589
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:41,139
Go.

590
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:46,095
(Laughs)

591
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:47,035
Let's go.

592
00:46:51,984 --> 00:47:01,697
(Singing)

593
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:19,058
(Gunshot)

594
00:47:45,522 --> 00:47:46,802
(Barks)

595
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,284
(Barks)

596
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:06,904
Where's your son?
Have you hidden him inside?

597
00:48:07,443 --> 00:48:10,686
He's not at home.
-He murdered.

598
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,520
Do you know that?

599
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,229
How about your husband?

600
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:19,675
How about your son?

601
00:48:21,222 --> 00:48:24,560
You are alone.
What all will you endure?

602
00:48:27,215 --> 00:48:28,741
If you need me...

603
00:48:29,545 --> 00:48:33,457
...meet me... at my quarters.

604
00:48:37,972 --> 00:48:44,925
"I spoke to my darling at night."

605
00:48:47,587 --> 00:48:49,451
(Bike engine starts)

606
00:48:50,768 --> 00:48:55,245
(Bike passing sound)

607
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:11,961
(Muslim prayer)

608
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:40,986
What all I am going through
because of you...

609
00:49:56,092 --> 00:50:02,549
Why? Why did you kill him?

610
00:50:03,707 --> 00:50:05,136
Tell me! Tell me!

611
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,311
I will thrash you. Tell me!

612
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:13,342
Will you tell me or not?
Why did you kill him? -Mother? Mother?

613
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:17,310
You've made my life miserable.
Why did you...?

614
00:50:17,549 --> 00:50:20,116
He killed my father...
so I killed him.

615
00:50:22,757 --> 00:50:27,036
I am going... I am leaving the house.
I'll never return.

616
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,404
Avdesh! Avdesh!

617
00:50:37,025 --> 00:50:38,011
Avdesh!

618
00:51:13,778 --> 00:51:14,804
Where are they three?

619
00:51:15,785 --> 00:51:16,909
They are going to Patna.

620
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:18,973
To look for Poonam.

621
00:51:25,128 --> 00:51:27,924
There's somebody named
Ranjan in Ameethapur.

622
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:30,708
Mahesh told me.

623
00:51:37,586 --> 00:51:39,349
Lakhan is a big criminal.

624
00:51:40,294 --> 00:51:42,703
He made three innocent children
as criminal.

625
00:51:43,512 --> 00:51:45,135
He is using them.

626
00:51:46,285 --> 00:51:49,364
You gave him the contract.

627
00:51:49,545 --> 00:51:52,884
Neha dear,
you are doing a good deed.

628
00:51:53,354 --> 00:51:55,380
We want that good deed
to get completed.

629
00:51:55,997 --> 00:51:58,219
What do we have to do
with Lakhan's past?

630
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,971
He is working... we just need
the work to be done. That's it.

631
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:04,998
Mr. Kailash,
touch your heart and tell me...

632
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:08,105
...is it okay if a hooligan
does this good deed?

633
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:08,952
Ms. Neha...

634
00:52:11,403 --> 00:52:13,943
...talk softly, somebody may hear you.

635
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,668
Hiralal says that
Lakhan is a bad man.

636
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:19,628
We shouldn't take risk
by talking against him.

637
00:52:20,126 --> 00:52:22,364
We'll all do the work...
what's wrong in it?

638
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:25,658
A criminal can't build
a school building.

639
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:27,756
Criminal?
He's not a criminal, but a shrew.

640
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:29,924
He hasn't started working on
my house yet.

641
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:31,995
Your house?

642
00:52:38,264 --> 00:52:39,276
I'm going to Patna.

643
00:52:39,467 --> 00:52:41,807
Tell Lakhan to stay away from this job.

644
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,059
I'll return and talk to you.
-No.

645
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,805
Goodbye...
-Listen...

646
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:48,763
(Sighs)

647
00:52:49,885 --> 00:52:52,166
Hit him!
-It slipped out of my mouth.

648
00:52:52,246 --> 00:52:54,653
You should've kept your mouth shut!
How could you...

649
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:56,228
Shut up!
-He ruined our plans.

650
00:52:56,249 --> 00:52:56,782
Oh no.

651
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:43,463
Open... open the window.

652
00:53:53,423 --> 00:53:55,543
Cool breeze.
-It is cool breeze.

653
00:53:55,888 --> 00:53:57,195
Increase the speed.

654
00:53:57,477 --> 00:53:59,131
Yes, increase the speed.

655
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,680
Water...

656
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,715
Play a song...
-Come on, play it.

657
00:54:25,484 --> 00:54:33,119
"Which place is this?
It is a four feet wall."

658
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:40,065
"O sir, we got sold cheaper
than the cattle."

659
00:54:43,766 --> 00:54:50,983
"Which place is this?
It is a four feet wall."

660
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:58,286
"O sir, we got sold cheaper
than the cattle."

661
00:54:58,454 --> 00:55:05,215
"O sir, our tears are
flowing non-stop."

662
00:55:06,627 --> 00:55:09,328
Children aged 12-13 years
have become criminals.

663
00:55:10,136 --> 00:55:11,448
They are committing murders.

664
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:15,776
Child trafficking is also
a big problem in that village.

665
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:19,955
Boys are sold and bought for
Rs. 5000 to Rs. 10,000.

666
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:30,941
There's someone named Ranjan in
Ameethapur here... he's behind everything.

667
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,153
Find him out.
-Ameethapur? That's a red-light area.

668
00:55:40,794 --> 00:55:43,727
We can put NGO pressure
on Ameethapur police station...

669
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:44,935
...we can take their help.

670
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:14,651
Hey, does Ranjan stay here?

671
00:56:15,768 --> 00:56:17,819
Yes, upstairs. Go.
-Okay.

672
00:56:32,403 --> 00:56:34,997
Here... see if it contains
Poonam's photo in it.

673
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:11,480
Is she Poonam?
You'll get her tomorrow morning.

674
00:57:13,544 --> 00:57:15,697
You've come from far.
You must be tired. So, take rest.

675
00:57:16,606 --> 00:57:18,249
I will send food for you all.

676
00:57:19,253 --> 00:57:21,289
I respect Mr. Lakhan very much.

677
00:57:22,117 --> 00:57:25,419
You are fortunate that
you got Poonam so easily.

678
00:57:25,614 --> 00:57:27,751
I'll be back.
You don't go anywhere.

679
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,439
Stay here.

680
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:35,131
(Door closed sounds)

681
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,832
(Door locked)

682
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,345
(Laughs)

683
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,343
Uncle, I've locked those
three guys in the room.

684
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:49,181
Take care of them.
-Who are they three?

685
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,379
They are birds.

686
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:53,518
They came flying to me.

687
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:55,344
Take care.

688
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:59,924
(Police siren)

689
00:58:01,486 --> 00:58:03,126
We were looking for an opportunity.

690
00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:06,327
There's something wrong going on
in this mansion.

691
00:58:07,062 --> 00:58:09,368
Ranjan was on
our radar from long time.

692
00:58:10,207 --> 00:58:12,192
Your NGO has given us
this opportunity...

693
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,464
...by putting pressure on
our Department.

694
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:18,220
Shall we?
-Yes.

695
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:23,181
"Your silky tresses."

696
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:27,590
Hey, you didn't find anyone?
-Why are you standing here?

697
00:58:31,004 --> 00:58:34,194
Go away...
-Come on.

698
00:58:34,409 --> 00:58:36,301
Police! Police! Flee!

699
00:58:40,234 --> 00:58:43,193
Do you know Ranjan?
Do you know him?

700
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:45,882
Where is Ranjan?
-I don't know.

701
00:58:48,206 --> 00:58:50,737
Hey, who is Ranjan? Where is he?
-He's there.

702
00:58:50,758 --> 00:58:51,415
Ranjan!

703
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:57,085
Who is it? -I am your father!
Scoundrel, open the door!

704
00:58:57,165 --> 00:59:00,804
Open the door! Open it!
-(Door knocking)

705
00:59:03,476 --> 00:59:04,724
Are you Ranjan!

706
00:59:06,354 --> 00:59:08,449
Are you Ranjan!
-No.

707
00:59:09,232 --> 00:59:10,467
Tell me...
-No.

708
00:59:10,488 --> 00:59:11,760
Sir, there are children here.

709
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:40,495
"You hurt me so much that
my dreams shattered."

710
00:59:40,624 --> 00:59:47,827
"Oh sir, no one should be born as girl."

711
00:59:52,287 --> 00:59:53,287
Where is Poonam?

712
00:59:54,693 --> 00:59:55,673
Speak up!

713
00:59:57,896 --> 00:59:59,638
Who is Poonam amongst you?

714
01:00:02,922 --> 01:00:04,066
From Birwa village.

715
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,090
It is her.

716
01:00:06,544 --> 01:00:13,450
"The house is on the river bank
of Ganges in the east."

717
01:00:13,896 --> 01:00:23,651
"Oh sir, I am three miles away
from the home now."

718
01:00:24,225 --> 01:00:28,927
(Police siren)

719
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,444
You go and look there.
-Okay, sir.

720
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:37,160
Let's go.

721
01:00:43,963 --> 01:00:46,233
Who is inside? Hey!

722
01:00:49,248 --> 01:00:50,177
Is anyone inside?

723
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:57,140
Hey, open the door.
-(Door knocking)

724
01:00:59,512 --> 01:01:01,918
Where's Ranjan's house?
-Sir, this is the one.

725
01:01:03,788 --> 01:01:05,649
Constable!
-Yes, sir?

726
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,333
Get something to break the lock.
-Okay.

727
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:11,488
(Door knocking)

728
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,830
Avdesh, are you alright?

729
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,844
(Door knocking)

730
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:18,152
Sir, take this.
-Yes.

731
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,128
(Door knocking)

732
01:01:27,911 --> 01:01:30,546
Hey, move back...
-Move back.

733
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:32,179
Avdesh...
-Move back...

734
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,160
Avdesh, listen to me.

735
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,400
Move back...

736
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:37,093
Hey.
-Run!

737
01:01:37,153 --> 01:01:39,668
Avdesh!
-Constable, nab him!

738
01:01:39,748 --> 01:01:43,883
Hey, surround them!
-I'm telling you to stop! Stop!

739
01:01:46,315 --> 01:01:48,167
Hari!
-Run!

740
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:50,221
Stop!

741
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,585
Hey, stop!

742
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:02,798
They escaped in the dark.

743
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:04,579
It is hard to find them.

744
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:06,859
I know them.

745
01:02:11,883 --> 01:02:12,697
Thank you, Ms. Neha.

746
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:17,385
Because of your information, we've
caught hold of human trafficking gang.

747
01:02:18,264 --> 01:02:21,282
We have sent all the children
to child refuge.

748
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:24,041
You got your Poonam back.

749
01:02:32,597 --> 01:02:34,702
You please have a seat. Sit.

750
01:02:35,894 --> 01:02:38,572
By the way,
where are those guys from?

751
01:02:39,157 --> 01:02:42,884
There's a village named Birwa near
Betiya, they belong to that place.

752
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,533
Ranjan has revealed everything.
A man named Lakhan...

753
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:49,533
...he is the chief of child abduction.

754
01:02:57,072 --> 01:03:00,129
Lakhan is a hardcore criminal.
He makes criminals.

755
01:03:01,384 --> 01:03:02,905
He is involved in child trafficking too.

756
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:05,509
No one is doing anything against him.

757
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:08,511
Lakhan should be removed from this job...

758
01:03:08,612 --> 01:03:10,297
...and this contract should be
handed over to someone else.

759
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:16,958
Ms. Neha, do we need Vibhishan
to win over Lanka or not? Tell me.

760
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:21,533
Lakhan is a bad man.
He'll have work...

761
01:03:21,648 --> 01:03:23,365
...then everything will go on smoothly.

762
01:03:23,782 --> 01:03:27,188
Your school will get
completed on time, right?

763
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:29,241
Look, you must be mistaken.

764
01:03:29,897 --> 01:03:33,249
I know Lakhan personally.
He's a nice man.

765
01:03:34,401 --> 01:03:35,097
(Chuckles)

766
01:03:35,506 --> 01:03:39,389
I'm seeing love in your eyes
since the first day.

767
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,864
What?
-For the village.

768
01:03:44,546 --> 01:03:46,479
I am seeing love in your eyes...

769
01:03:46,815 --> 01:03:48,221
...for the children of the village.

770
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:51,196
Shall I suggest you something?
Why don't you join politics?

771
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:54,679
I give you the guarantee of
getting a ticket.

772
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:59,991
When a beautiful girl like you will
stand on the stage for a speech...

773
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:03,276
then we need not toil to get the crowd...
-I am not interested in joining politics.

774
01:04:04,072 --> 01:04:05,781
I will expose Lakhan.

775
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,567
But I think, many more people
will be exposed with Lakhan.

776
01:04:12,368 --> 01:04:16,199
Ms. Neha, you got angry.

777
01:04:18,276 --> 01:04:20,571
You want to remove Lakhan, right?

778
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,530
Yes.
-Okay, I'll remove him.

779
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:26,256
Give me... where do I have to sign?
Give it to me.

780
01:04:30,894 --> 01:04:34,090
(Crickets creaking)

781
01:04:54,756 --> 01:04:58,365
Hey, get it. Hurry up.
-Yes, I'll get it.

782
01:05:33,322 --> 01:05:36,947
"By cleaning the house and courtyard...

783
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:40,663
...and after washing the dishes...

784
01:05:40,743 --> 01:05:47,960
...I became like the branch of
the tree, Oh sir."

785
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:58,987
"By cleaning the house and courtyard
and after washing the dishes...

786
01:05:59,032 --> 01:06:06,270
...I became like the branch of
the tree, Oh sir." -Poonam?

787
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:13,609
"You took the money
and chopped me off."

788
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:20,838
"Oh sir, you made a
daughter as an animal."

789
01:06:20,918 --> 01:06:28,243
"Oh sir, you made a daughter
as an animal."

790
01:06:28,323 --> 01:06:35,704
"Oh sir, my tears are flowing non-stop."
-Madam...

791
01:06:43,038 --> 01:06:46,302
What are you watching?
Go and inform her parents.

792
01:06:46,415 --> 01:06:49,185
Go and inform her parents, son.

793
01:06:49,265 --> 01:06:52,604
Your parents will be so happy.

794
01:06:53,024 --> 01:06:56,636
My child is back...

795
01:06:59,778 --> 01:07:01,226
May god bless you.

796
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:07,198
"It is a four feet wall."

797
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:14,041
"Oh sir, I got sold cheaper
than the cattle."

798
01:07:17,837 --> 01:07:25,161
"Which place is this?
It is a four feet wall."

799
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:32,326
"Oh sir, I got sold cheaper
than the cattle."

800
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:42,084
(Indistinct chatter)

801
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:47,081
Hey, give it to me...
come on, throw it down.

802
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:52,250
Hey, careful...
-Give it to me.

803
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:53,864
Take this... Take this.

804
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,561
Bhola...
-Yes, sir?

805
01:07:55,755 --> 01:07:59,243
I heard, you get such
goggles in the city...

806
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,013
...in which you can see
under the clothes.

807
01:08:02,851 --> 01:08:05,054
Boss, you are right.
Even I heard that.

808
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:11,000
Madam, please come. Look, the
construction of the school has begun.

809
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:13,753
Lakhan, what is this?

810
01:08:15,067 --> 01:08:16,377
These are bricks.

811
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:20,521
I am not talking about bricks.
I'm talking about children.

812
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:22,706
Yes, they are children.

813
01:08:23,743 --> 01:08:26,241
I think you don't know that
making children work...

814
01:08:26,262 --> 01:08:27,992
...who are under 18 years, is a crime.

815
01:08:28,575 --> 01:08:29,528
Is it?

816
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:33,602
Give it to me...
-What is this?

817
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:36,460
Children, stop it. Come down.
-Hey...

818
01:08:36,516 --> 01:08:38,134
Stop it...
-Come down.

819
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,360
Get down.
-Let's go.

820
01:08:39,459 --> 01:08:41,008
Go...
-Go to your house.

821
01:08:41,088 --> 01:08:44,379
You go now. Come after you
have crossed 18 years.

822
01:08:46,962 --> 01:08:49,001
He's doing crime.
-Yes.

823
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:51,341
Take this.
-What is this?

824
01:08:51,813 --> 01:08:53,105
It is minister's letter.

825
01:08:53,419 --> 01:08:55,555
You've been removed
from this contract.

826
01:08:57,986 --> 01:08:59,248
What?

827
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:03,327
Your work is done.
Enough, you may leave now.

828
01:09:16,202 --> 01:09:17,841
(Engine starts)

829
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:29,823
Ms. Neha, what have you done?
You sacked Lakhan.

830
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,234
I didn't sack Lakhan,
but Mr. Baldev did.

831
01:09:33,755 --> 01:09:35,711
Baldev is incarnation of God here.

832
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:37,511
Lakhan is the owner.

833
01:09:37,648 --> 01:09:39,543
We are just pawns.

834
01:09:39,991 --> 01:09:44,839
Even we'll resign from the trust.
If we are alive, we'll built a house.

835
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:48,543
Ms. Neha, you look for another
village to build your school.

836
01:09:48,662 --> 01:09:50,431
Go away. Immediately.

837
01:09:51,618 --> 01:09:55,303
You don't worry.
My NGO will handle the trust.

838
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:00,373
She is very adamant.

839
01:10:00,986 --> 01:10:02,540
Let's go to Mr. Lakhan.
-Come.

840
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,608
Before he avenges us...
-Let's go.

841
01:10:04,629 --> 01:10:06,638
We can't trust him.
He can do anything.

842
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,852
Everyone is here?

843
01:10:11,932 --> 01:10:13,095
Brother Lakhan...

844
01:10:13,116 --> 01:10:15,561
Brother Lakhan, forgive us.
-What's the matter?

845
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:18,270
Leave my legs.
-No, until you don't forgive us...

846
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,108
...we will not leave your legs.

847
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:22,465
Okay, I forgive you.

848
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:26,987
He forgave us.
-My three lions are here.

849
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:28,902
You get up and go home.

850
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:32,083
Look, I will build the school.

851
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:34,290
You just support me.

852
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:37,769
Goodbye... Go, go.
-Goodbye.

853
01:10:37,841 --> 01:10:40,032
Thank you.
-Go, please go.

854
01:10:42,177 --> 01:10:43,695
Come here, my lion. Come on!

855
01:10:45,472 --> 01:10:49,231
Come on, well done! Come, come.

856
01:10:52,421 --> 01:10:53,419
I heard that...

857
01:10:54,832 --> 01:10:58,455
...school teacher followed you to Patna.

858
01:10:58,659 --> 01:10:59,995
To nab you.

859
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:06,218
She has sworn to get you caught.
She's your enemy.

860
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:10,014
If she gets us caught, she'll die.

861
01:11:10,035 --> 01:11:11,711
She has to die.

862
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:15,071
You three are lions.

863
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:16,911
She is after you.

864
01:11:17,324 --> 01:11:20,184
(Laughs)

865
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:21,822
Don't waste time.

866
01:11:22,822 --> 01:11:25,243
Shoot her on sight.

867
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:30,490
Before she gets to your neck, kill her.

868
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,835
Go... very good. Go.

869
01:11:43,825 --> 01:11:45,301
The trust has become fund.

870
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:49,877
I'll meet the minister
after the teacher dies.

871
01:11:51,381 --> 01:11:53,309
I will take back the school contract.

872
01:11:54,425 --> 01:11:55,341
Understood?

873
01:11:56,198 --> 01:11:59,141
I don't give money simply
for minister's elections.

874
01:12:02,299 --> 01:12:05,755
Contract is of no use
if there's no murders.

875
01:12:07,307 --> 01:12:10,719
An animal costs more than
a child in our village.

876
01:12:10,768 --> 01:12:13,648
Sir, 15 children have been sold
from our village.

877
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,735
All this is because of
Raghuveer and Lakhan.

878
01:12:21,161 --> 01:12:23,904
We had taken some loan
from Raghuveer.

879
01:12:24,999 --> 01:12:27,202
He snatched our cattle
and land in return.

880
01:12:27,282 --> 01:12:28,866
He killed my husband too.

881
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:43,780
I will see.

882
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:05,707
Avdesh, what are you doing?

883
01:13:07,892 --> 01:13:09,153
Are you supporting Lakhan?

884
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:11,596
The same Lakhan who killed your father?

885
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,744
This girl, she saved your Poonam.

886
01:13:15,839 --> 01:13:17,369
Will you shoot her?

887
01:13:18,147 --> 01:13:22,333
Come on... kill me... Kill her!

888
01:13:22,623 --> 01:13:26,096
Come on, kill her! Kill me.
Kill everyone in the village.

889
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:29,675
Come on, shoot.
What are you watching! Come on!

890
01:13:32,593 --> 01:13:34,955
Avdesh, Lakhan is using you.

891
01:13:35,474 --> 01:13:37,420
Surrender yourself to the police.

892
01:13:37,922 --> 01:13:40,600
Nothing will happen to you,
I'll be with you... -Stay back.

893
01:14:04,009 --> 01:14:05,793
If the teacher wasn't there...

894
01:14:06,462 --> 01:14:08,944
...Poonam wouldn't have returned.

895
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:15,781
Scoundrel Lakhan is manipulating us.

896
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:19,501
He killed my father,
now he's become my father.

897
01:14:20,185 --> 01:14:22,118
Lakhan must be bad man of this area.

898
01:14:23,462 --> 01:14:26,731
We have killed an ant.
We've killed a rat.

899
01:14:27,049 --> 01:14:28,371
We have killed a snake.

900
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:30,427
We have killed human too.

901
01:14:30,932 --> 01:14:33,595
Now we'll kill Lakhan.
-How will we kill him?

902
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:36,723
He comes to the furnace every morning.

903
01:14:39,366 --> 01:14:41,379
Find out whose place is this.

904
01:14:41,647 --> 01:14:43,635
I have to buy it. Understood?
-Okay, boss.

905
01:14:43,677 --> 01:14:46,327
There'll be a highway here...
railway track here.

906
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:47,583
The value will increase.

907
01:14:47,754 --> 01:14:48,656
(Gunshot)

908
01:14:48,988 --> 01:14:50,881
Did you hear a gunshot?
-There, boss.

909
01:14:53,402 --> 01:14:56,597
Boss, where are you?
-Hey!

910
01:14:56,677 --> 01:14:58,313
Why is he shouting so much?
-Boss!

911
01:14:58,334 --> 01:14:59,649
Boss, where are you?

912
01:14:59,717 --> 01:15:02,313
Boss!
-What's the matter? Who shot?

913
01:15:02,393 --> 01:15:03,818
Those three guys.

914
01:15:04,069 --> 01:15:06,790
Boss, those three guys killed Ravi.

915
01:15:13,354 --> 01:15:17,259
Run, boss!
-Hey, start the car!

916
01:15:17,339 --> 01:15:20,435
Hey, start the car!
-We'll not spare him.

917
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:23,680
Hey, stop! Stop!
-(Gunshot)

918
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,408
Come on, move, move!

919
01:15:28,134 --> 01:15:29,206
(Gunshot)

920
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:34,284
Stop! Where are you running? Stop!

921
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:36,559
Scoundrel!

922
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:43,486
Balkishan!
-Why did this idiot come here?

923
01:15:43,608 --> 01:15:45,270
Hey Balkishan!
-Oh.

924
01:15:45,716 --> 01:15:47,193
Why are you panting so much?

925
01:15:47,605 --> 01:15:51,303
(Panting)

926
01:15:52,836 --> 01:15:55,793
What's the matter?
-(Panting)

927
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:57,309
Why are you so tensed?

928
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:02,854
I got saved. (Panting)
Balkishan, I got saved.

929
01:16:03,507 --> 01:16:07,477
He shot at me.
-You? Who shot at you?

930
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,283
Those... (Panting)
those three guys fired bullet at me.

931
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:18,682
Those guys fired bullet at you?
-Yes. (Panting)

932
01:16:19,457 --> 01:16:22,121
They were my servants,
but they betrayed me.

933
01:16:23,124 --> 01:16:28,124
Now I have to escape from them
in my own village.

934
01:16:28,867 --> 01:16:32,813
I have to fear them.
Balkishan, do something.

935
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:35,551
Kill them.
-No, I can't.

936
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:38,478
SP has ordered us to arrest them.

937
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:40,449
Is SP superior than me?

938
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,840
Brother, SP is superior.
-Balkishan!

939
01:16:42,935 --> 01:16:45,150
I mean, even you are superior.

940
01:16:45,713 --> 01:16:50,023
Now... this police job is such.

941
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:52,655
I will find a way.
-No, no.

942
01:16:54,451 --> 01:16:55,759
You don't find a way.

943
01:16:57,504 --> 01:16:59,246
I will find a way myself.

944
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,966
That teacher is acting very smart.

945
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:09,555
Now I will act smart.

946
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:15,591
You just sit and watch. Understood?

947
01:17:16,843 --> 01:17:19,366
You'll just watch.
-Okay.

948
01:17:19,766 --> 01:17:22,296
Hey... have something cold at least.

949
01:17:24,288 --> 01:17:25,471
Oh no!

950
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:32,950
(Bird chirping)

951
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,300
Did you admit Ravi in the hospital?

952
01:17:44,586 --> 01:17:46,381
Boss, Ravi died.

953
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:50,405
(Grunts)

954
01:17:54,206 --> 01:17:55,691
This is that teacher's doing.

955
01:17:57,498 --> 01:17:59,692
All this happened because of her.

956
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,931
Bhola...
-Yes, boss?

957
01:18:03,165 --> 01:18:04,102
Bhola!

958
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:10,485
Find her...
find her and get her here.

959
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:13,716
I will show her who I am.

960
01:18:15,617 --> 01:18:18,747
Until you don't get her, I'll sit here.

961
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:22,327
I will not move from here. Get her!
-Let's go.

962
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:24,894
I will not spare that teacher.

963
01:18:25,759 --> 01:18:32,407
"Touch the gem of education
with knowledge."

964
01:18:32,487 --> 01:18:36,488
"Make our lives worth living."

965
01:18:36,568 --> 01:18:40,746
"Make our lives worth living."

966
01:18:42,664 --> 01:18:46,205
Move...
-Hey, move!

967
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,785
Hey, what are you doing?
-Come on!

968
01:18:58,312 --> 01:19:02,407
Leave me! Leave me!
-Hey, move back children!

969
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,420
What are you doing?
-Hey, come on!

970
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,987
Move back! Come on!
-Come on!

971
01:19:08,366 --> 01:19:11,583
Hey Lallan, you get teacher's car.
-Leave me!

972
01:19:11,604 --> 01:19:14,037
Hey...
-Leave me!

973
01:19:14,556 --> 01:19:16,489
Where are you taking me?
-Hey!

974
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:20,210
(Screaming)

975
01:19:24,813 --> 01:19:26,813
Hold her tightly.

976
01:19:27,188 --> 01:19:29,579
Shut up...
-Sit quietly.

977
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,494
Shut up, don't make any noise.

978
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:35,835
You are acting very smart.
-Shut up!

979
01:19:35,915 --> 01:19:38,110
Will you mess with us?
-Shut up!

980
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:42,462
Just sit quietly.

981
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:47,245
Hold her tightly.
-Hey, hold her.

982
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:50,665
Don't make any noise.

983
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,095
Greetings... teacher.
-Come on, get down.

984
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:14,516
Get her here.
-Come on, move.

985
01:20:14,596 --> 01:20:17,203
Hey, come on.
-Boss, here's the teacher.

986
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:22,416
(Stretching)

987
01:20:28,669 --> 01:20:33,665
Oh city girl...
have you heard that old proverb?

988
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:39,478
You shouldn't lock horns with
someone living in the same area.

989
01:20:45,972 --> 01:20:49,228
You've come to our area
and sacked me from the job.

990
01:20:51,524 --> 01:20:58,241
Those three guys...
who used to listen to me blindly...

991
01:20:58,986 --> 01:21:00,736
...you turned them against me.

992
01:21:02,951 --> 01:21:06,312
You made them attack me?

993
01:21:06,773 --> 01:21:12,260
Police may be working
for the public in your city.

994
01:21:14,021 --> 01:21:16,217
The law may be working for the public.

995
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,235
But here...

996
01:21:22,034 --> 01:21:25,318
...police works to protect me...

997
01:21:25,868 --> 01:21:29,446
...and law also works to protect me.

998
01:21:30,087 --> 01:21:31,134
Understood?

999
01:21:32,195 --> 01:21:37,546
Look, no matter
what I do with you here...

1000
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:44,571
...neither law nor the police
will harm me.

1001
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:52,075
I will harm you.

1002
01:21:53,657 --> 01:21:54,462
(Slaps)

1003
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:04,431
This is the punishment
for sacking me from the job.

1004
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:06,434
(Slaps)

1005
01:22:09,123 --> 01:22:11,963
(Laughs)

1006
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:16,625
This is the punishment for manipulating
those three guys against me.

1007
01:22:18,317 --> 01:22:19,027
(Slaps)

1008
01:22:25,247 --> 01:22:31,045
This is the punishment for getting
those three guys attack me.

1009
01:22:32,032 --> 01:22:35,540
But the real punishment begins now.

1010
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:40,351
Bhola...
-Yes, boss?

1011
01:22:42,108 --> 01:22:44,681
Remove her clothes.
-Okay, boss.

1012
01:22:45,163 --> 01:22:50,325
Let me see, how salty this city girl is.
-Leave me.

1013
01:22:50,777 --> 01:22:54,597
Come on, remove it.
-Look, don't do anything with me.

1014
01:22:54,748 --> 01:22:57,168
It will be bad...
-What bad?

1015
01:22:57,248 --> 01:22:59,059
Tell us.
-Hey, come on.

1016
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:01,768
Bhola... -Yes, boss?
-Yes, boss?

1017
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,411
Will you undress her
when she falls unconscious?

1018
01:23:04,571 --> 01:23:06,506
Hey, remove it!
-Okay, boss.

1019
01:23:06,586 --> 01:23:09,200
I want to see.

1020
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,952
Boss... hey!

1021
01:23:13,126 --> 01:23:15,828
No!
-We'll not spare you today.

1022
01:23:16,944 --> 01:23:18,444
(Screaming)

1023
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:22,076
She is not letting us undress her.
-Hey!

1024
01:23:22,392 --> 01:23:23,657
No!

1025
01:23:29,574 --> 01:23:31,439
No!

1026
01:23:44,723 --> 01:23:47,150
Pull it...
-Hey...

1027
01:23:49,116 --> 01:23:56,844
(Panting)

1028
01:23:57,790 --> 01:24:01,885
Hey...
-Tell your men to drop their guns.

1029
01:24:03,642 --> 01:24:05,447
(Panting)

1030
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:10,155
Hey, throw the guns.

1031
01:24:10,668 --> 01:24:12,709
Come this side, all of you.

1032
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:16,398
Come on, even you too.
-Hey, come on.

1033
01:24:18,018 --> 01:24:20,843
Contractor, come out with us.
You scoundrel.

1034
01:24:28,452 --> 01:24:29,810
What are you watching? Come on.

1035
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:32,804
Teacher, you leave.

1036
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:42,772
Hey, no one will come forward.
Move back. -Move back.

1037
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:44,686
Move back...
-Move back.

1038
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:47,398
Come on, you both go and sit.
Come on.

1039
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,487
Hands up...
-Move back.

1040
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:58,502
Move back... You both sit inside,
hurry up, come on.

1041
01:24:59,466 --> 01:25:03,008
Hands up... Come on.

1042
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:10,466
Scoundrel! Idiot!
-He just slipped out of our hands.

1043
01:25:31,843 --> 01:25:32,656
Wear this.

1044
01:25:37,686 --> 01:25:39,118
Thank you.

1045
01:25:39,616 --> 01:25:42,943
Why thank us. It is your jacket,
we're returning it to you.

1046
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:49,237
You are looking good wearing the jacket.

1047
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:55,221
You are really looking very pretty.

1048
01:25:55,711 --> 01:25:56,701
Really?

1049
01:25:58,975 --> 01:26:00,597
Okay, we shall leave.

1050
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,181
What happened?

1051
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:19,501
Will you leave me alone and go?

1052
01:26:20,022 --> 01:26:21,685
Further is our area.

1053
01:26:22,223 --> 01:26:24,007
No one goes there other than us.

1054
01:26:25,278 --> 01:26:27,463
I will come along with you.
-Okay, let's go.

1055
01:26:27,726 --> 01:26:30,362
We are having fun sitting in your car.

1056
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:34,007
Do this... drive faster.

1057
01:26:34,172 --> 01:26:36,146
It will be fun.
-Really?

1058
01:26:36,249 --> 01:26:38,627
The road is nice ahead.
-Okay, let's go.

1059
01:26:38,739 --> 01:26:42,363
"We are joyful and carefree."

1060
01:26:42,443 --> 01:26:45,890
"We are lost travelers."

1061
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:53,309
"We endured atrocities
and committed crime, Oh sir."

1062
01:26:57,038 --> 01:27:00,687
"We are joyful and carefree."

1063
01:27:00,767 --> 01:27:04,255
"We are lost travelers."

1064
01:27:04,393 --> 01:27:11,512
"We endured atrocities
and committed crime, Oh sir."

1065
01:27:11,635 --> 01:27:15,025
"We don't know what's right
and what's wrong."

1066
01:27:15,143 --> 01:27:18,684
"We don't know where to go."

1067
01:27:19,074 --> 01:27:26,038
"We are the king of this place, Oh sir."

1068
01:27:33,495 --> 01:27:41,727
"We are the king of this place, Oh sir."

1069
01:27:47,196 --> 01:27:48,131
(Clears throat)

1070
01:27:52,702 --> 01:27:55,215
Okay, we've reached our area.

1071
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,919
You go... go.

1072
01:28:03,002 --> 01:28:06,309
I am not going anywhere.
I'll stay with you...

1073
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:09,046
...in your area.

1074
01:28:14,346 --> 01:28:15,845
Will you do me a favor?
-What?

1075
01:28:16,812 --> 01:28:17,958
Give me a gun.

1076
01:28:18,692 --> 01:28:20,436
(Laughs)

1077
01:28:20,457 --> 01:28:21,525
Why are you laughing?

1078
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:24,814
It is not easy to fire the pistol.

1079
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:26,811
(Laughs)

1080
01:28:27,306 --> 01:28:30,455
How do you fire?
-I'll tell you.

1081
01:28:33,088 --> 01:28:33,801
(Gunshot)

1082
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:36,458
Did you see?
This is how a pistol is fired.

1083
01:28:36,688 --> 01:28:38,387
If we press the trigger...

1084
01:28:38,467 --> 01:28:41,404
...the bullet goes inside and
the brain comes out. -Brain comes out.

1085
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:46,626
Even I want to learn.
Then we all will kill Lakhan.

1086
01:28:47,082 --> 01:28:49,998
You are a woman, be under your limits.
-Yes.

1087
01:28:50,561 --> 01:28:53,406
Is it?
Tell me a work that woman can't do?

1088
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:55,972
(Laughs)

1089
01:28:56,107 --> 01:28:58,012
Let's go... Let's go.

1090
01:29:08,312 --> 01:29:13,241
(Laughs)

1091
01:29:13,377 --> 01:29:15,624
Women can't do this.

1092
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:19,368
(Laughs)

1093
01:29:20,151 --> 01:29:21,562
You all are great.

1094
01:29:22,335 --> 01:29:26,019
(Laughs)

1095
01:29:31,217 --> 01:29:35,152
(Laughs)

1096
01:29:36,107 --> 01:29:37,525
Run!
-Hey!

1097
01:29:38,175 --> 01:29:39,277
Stop!

1098
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:44,378
"This life is a boat.
There's no rower."

1099
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:47,986
"We are getting stuck."

1100
01:29:48,066 --> 01:29:55,446
"We are running
a race against wind, Oh sir."

1101
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,716
"This life is a boat.
There's no rower."

1102
01:30:02,796 --> 01:30:06,351
"We are getting stuck."

1103
01:30:06,431 --> 01:30:13,622
"We are running
a race against wind, Oh sir."

1104
01:30:13,702 --> 01:30:20,919
"Who do I complaint to?
All the relationships broke."

1105
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:28,851
"We are the punishment of
this birth, Oh sir."

1106
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:30,218
You are a nice girl.

1107
01:30:32,324 --> 01:30:35,217
If you were young,
I would've married you.

1108
01:30:35,444 --> 01:30:36,783
Is it?

1109
01:30:36,863 --> 01:30:39,111
(Laughs)

1110
01:30:39,802 --> 01:30:41,174
You can marry me even now.

1111
01:30:41,947 --> 01:30:43,997
What say? Will you marry her?

1112
01:30:46,401 --> 01:30:49,454
Gorak will marry when
he turns 21, right?

1113
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:53,071
I am just 13 years old, but married.

1114
01:30:53,106 --> 01:30:54,940
(Laughs)

1115
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:56,953
Avdesh, your marriage is wrong.

1116
01:30:58,395 --> 01:31:02,338
Guy should be 21 and girl
should be 18 for marriage.

1117
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:15,680
(Laughs)

1118
01:31:18,534 --> 01:31:19,685
You all are very nice.

1119
01:31:20,736 --> 01:31:22,155
Why did you go in the wrong path?

1120
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,163
What wrong we did?

1121
01:31:24,798 --> 01:31:28,096
You murder people and ask
me what wrong you did?

1122
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:32,243
Who did we kill? Who?

1123
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:37,463
Raghuveer thrashed
my father to death. He?

1124
01:31:38,097 --> 01:31:39,018
Mahadev...

1125
01:31:39,717 --> 01:31:44,029
...being a police inspector, he used to
tease the women of our village. He?

1126
01:31:44,695 --> 01:31:48,506
Paras wanted to swindle
your school money.

1127
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,294
He? Did we do wrong by killing him?

1128
01:31:50,425 --> 01:31:53,426
We will kill Lakhan now.
He is everyone's leader.

1129
01:31:54,449 --> 01:31:55,882
Tell me, what wrong do we do?

1130
01:31:57,496 --> 01:32:00,211
What you do is the work of the law.

1131
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:02,011
Violence is wrong.

1132
01:32:15,557 --> 01:32:18,699
Few goons came to the school
and abducted Neha.

1133
01:32:18,802 --> 01:32:20,392
In front of everyone.

1134
01:32:21,361 --> 01:32:24,429
I think it is the doing of
those three guys. -Yes.

1135
01:32:24,463 --> 01:32:26,477
They would've kidnapped Ms. Neha.

1136
01:32:26,517 --> 01:32:29,113
Inspector, do something.
-Yes, inspector.

1137
01:32:29,382 --> 01:32:31,575
The entire day has come to an end,
but Ms. Neha has not returned.

1138
01:32:31,627 --> 01:32:33,843
Neha's car is parked near the ruins.

1139
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:35,735
But Ms. Neha is not in it.
-Yes.

1140
01:32:35,756 --> 01:32:37,162
They are children...

1141
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:40,836
...but remember that
they can do anything with Neha.

1142
01:32:43,085 --> 01:32:44,912
They dwell in the ruins.
-Yes.

1143
01:32:44,994 --> 01:32:47,653
You don't worry... Look...

1144
01:32:47,733 --> 01:32:50,761
...I've called for special force
from Betiya.

1145
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:54,540
To nab those three guys. Had
you not come, we would've gone there.

1146
01:32:56,361 --> 01:32:57,726
Hey...
-Yes, sir?

1147
01:32:57,767 --> 01:32:59,782
Let's go.
-Okay, sir.

1148
01:33:00,936 --> 01:33:02,366
Hey, hurry up.

1149
01:33:04,616 --> 01:33:07,118
You don't worry.
Everything will be alright.

1150
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,379
Police is here.

1151
01:33:16,793 --> 01:33:19,780
Did you have fun?
You are very nice.

1152
01:33:55,784 --> 01:34:00,014
What is this?
You abducted Neha in my presence.

1153
01:34:01,718 --> 01:34:05,895
All the villagers know that Lakhan
kidnapped me and brought me to this state.

1154
01:34:06,664 --> 01:34:10,319
But you don't know...
these children saved my life.

1155
01:34:11,637 --> 01:34:16,246
Okay... these villagers spread rumors.

1156
01:34:18,123 --> 01:34:21,296
But madam, we have to take them.

1157
01:34:22,611 --> 01:34:23,300
Shall we?

1158
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,307
Go...

1159
01:34:26,737 --> 01:34:28,554
Come on...
-I'll follow you.

1160
01:34:30,702 --> 01:34:34,076
Come on, you scoundrels.
You've made my life miserable.

1161
01:34:35,869 --> 01:34:37,871
We didn't take
so much time to nab a dacoit...

1162
01:34:37,951 --> 01:34:39,335
...the time we took to look for you.

1163
01:34:40,422 --> 01:34:43,260
Senior officers have made
our lives miserable.

1164
01:34:44,422 --> 01:34:47,266
You were playing hide and seek with us.
-Let's go.

1165
01:34:47,362 --> 01:34:48,909
Let's go...
-You were playing peek-a-boo with us.

1166
01:34:48,989 --> 01:34:52,733
We'll show you in the police station what
punishment you get for carrying a pistol.

1167
01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:55,909
Come on, sit inside...
or I'll thrash you.

1168
01:34:55,989 --> 01:34:57,544
Sit inside. Come on.
-Yes.

1169
01:34:58,626 --> 01:34:59,836
Come on, drive.

1170
01:35:12,451 --> 01:35:16,526
Come on, come on. Sit there!

1171
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:27,559
You made us run after you so much.
You killed Mahadev.

1172
01:35:30,549 --> 01:35:32,618
What do you think of yourself?

1173
01:35:34,118 --> 01:35:37,307
How dare you stare at me?

1174
01:35:37,473 --> 01:35:40,133
Hey, why are you hitting him?

1175
01:35:41,718 --> 01:35:44,053
I am not hitting him.

1176
01:35:46,971 --> 01:35:52,030
Tell her... I was just...
why will I hit them?

1177
01:35:53,744 --> 01:35:58,561
Look, Lakhan did whatever
he wanted to do with me.

1178
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:04,968
These three children are with you.

1179
01:36:05,627 --> 01:36:07,806
They'll tell you. Ask them...

1180
01:36:08,338 --> 01:36:12,014
...who gave pistol in their hands
and told them to murder?

1181
01:36:12,766 --> 01:36:15,639
Then I'll see how Lakhan
escapes from the law.

1182
01:36:15,987 --> 01:36:18,338
How long will he escape?
-I'll write a FIR.

1183
01:36:18,528 --> 01:36:20,989
I will make a dairy,
then I'll see how Mr. Lakhan...

1184
01:36:21,386 --> 01:36:23,116
How long can Lakhan escape?

1185
01:36:23,157 --> 01:36:25,394
He has ruined the peace of the village.

1186
01:36:25,839 --> 01:36:28,818
His future generations
will directly go to jail.

1187
01:36:28,954 --> 01:36:30,834
His hooliganism is too much.

1188
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:34,858
Ms. Neha, I am with you.
I am with you.

1189
01:36:35,491 --> 01:36:36,057
Hello sir...

1190
01:36:36,174 --> 01:36:37,794
Ms. Neha...
-Yes.

1191
01:36:38,265 --> 01:36:41,306
Yes... three guys are
in the police custody.

1192
01:36:41,752 --> 01:36:42,958
I want to meet you.

1193
01:36:44,995 --> 01:36:45,776
Yes.

1194
01:36:47,859 --> 01:36:48,956
Yes, sir.

1195
01:36:49,917 --> 01:36:52,393
Who are you calling?

1196
01:36:53,211 --> 01:36:53,866
Dm.

1197
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:56,231
He has called me.

1198
01:36:56,818 --> 01:37:00,754
He wants you to enquire
the children by tonight.

1199
01:37:01,724 --> 01:37:03,575
We'll have to take them to the juvenile
home tomorrow morning.

1200
01:37:03,655 --> 01:37:05,138
(Laughs)

1201
01:37:06,673 --> 01:37:09,819
Ms. Neha, you are great.

1202
01:37:10,518 --> 01:37:12,207
You called the DM directly.

1203
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:15,753
I had known that you are influential.

1204
01:37:16,165 --> 01:37:20,300
Does anyone come to this jungle
from so far to build a school?

1205
01:37:20,513 --> 01:37:23,192
You will put an end to Lakhan's chaos.

1206
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:32,094
Look, I have to go.

1207
01:37:33,703 --> 01:37:34,891
But I'll return tomorrow morning.

1208
01:37:36,535 --> 01:37:38,380
I will take you three along with me.

1209
01:37:40,634 --> 01:37:42,626
Okay?
-Okay.

1210
01:37:44,764 --> 01:37:45,770
Take care of yourself.

1211
01:37:56,858 --> 01:37:57,868
Dm...

1212
01:38:00,615 --> 01:38:03,904
Didn't I tell you that one day
they'll find the right path?

1213
01:38:05,729 --> 01:38:07,791
Look, they are in front of you.

1214
01:39:19,174 --> 01:39:22,173
Ms. Neha, you did the right thing
by getting those three arrested.

1215
01:39:23,254 --> 01:39:26,206
I've told SP,
Lakhan will be arrested tonight.

1216
01:39:26,602 --> 01:39:30,814
SP was apologizing for whatever
Lakhan and his men did with you.

1217
01:39:32,486 --> 01:39:33,709
Now you go and relax.

1218
01:39:35,158 --> 01:39:40,704
(Keyboard clacking)

1219
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,323
(Sighs)

1220
01:40:00,493 --> 01:40:07,644
(Phone ringing)

1221
01:40:08,177 --> 01:40:08,812
Hello?

1222
01:40:10,928 --> 01:40:11,559
Yes, sir.

1223
01:40:13,037 --> 01:40:13,743
Yes, sir.

1224
01:40:15,069 --> 01:40:15,721
Okay.

1225
01:40:17,015 --> 01:40:18,496
Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir.

1226
01:40:19,798 --> 01:40:20,544
Mishra...

1227
01:40:22,482 --> 01:40:23,584
Yes, sir?
-Get the jeep.

1228
01:40:24,559 --> 01:40:28,036
SP had called.
We have to shift them to Betiya.

1229
01:40:28,315 --> 01:40:29,488
Okay, sir.
-Go.

1230
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:41,304
You don't worry.

1231
01:40:42,132 --> 01:40:43,452
Everything will be alright now.

1232
01:40:44,076 --> 01:40:45,207
SP had called.

1233
01:40:46,153 --> 01:40:49,160
We have to take them to Betiya,
to Ms. Neha.

1234
01:40:52,191 --> 01:40:54,697
Wake him up. Wake up...
-Hey, Gorak.

1235
01:40:55,235 --> 01:40:57,729
Hari, Gorak...
-Hey, wake up.

1236
01:41:00,128 --> 01:41:02,128
Ms. Neha has called.
-Come on.

1237
01:41:03,779 --> 01:41:06,070
You take rest.
You've been up all night.

1238
01:41:06,348 --> 01:41:08,582
You don't worry. We are here.

1239
01:41:09,238 --> 01:41:11,154
Come on. Let's go.

1240
01:41:14,387 --> 01:41:18,938
Will you sit here? Go home,
we'll talk tomorrow. Didn't you hear me?

1241
01:41:38,610 --> 01:41:41,889
(Yawning)

1242
01:42:06,376 --> 01:42:09,114
Get down... go and freshen up.
Come on.

1243
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:44,921
(Gunshot)
-(Groans)

1244
01:43:03,739 --> 01:43:07,016
Mishra, make a case of encounter.
-Okay, sir.

1245
01:43:08,798 --> 01:43:10,477
They were running
after firing a bullet at you.

1246
01:43:12,264 --> 01:43:14,894
(Gunshot)
-(Groans)

1247
01:43:20,419 --> 01:43:21,490
Hello?

1248
01:43:23,169 --> 01:43:24,402
Sir, the work is done.

1249
01:43:31,294 --> 01:43:33,474
(Yawning)

1250
01:43:38,148 --> 01:43:41,929
Boss, police killed those three guys.

1251
01:43:42,057 --> 01:43:44,504
Their bodies are at the well.

1252
01:43:45,008 --> 01:43:48,596
(Laughs)

1253
01:43:48,886 --> 01:43:51,352
I was on phone all night.

1254
01:43:52,474 --> 01:43:56,209
Until I don't see their dead bodies...

1255
01:43:56,759 --> 01:43:58,205
...I won't get peace.

1256
01:43:59,490 --> 01:44:00,223
Let's go.

1257
01:45:15,772 --> 01:45:17,394
She is here.
-(Car door closes)

1258
01:45:17,514 --> 01:45:19,707
Did you see the consequences
of doing hooliganism?

1259
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:23,664
(Spitting)

1260
01:45:24,297 --> 01:45:26,820
If you pick up a pistol,
you'll die from one.

1261
01:45:28,295 --> 01:45:29,732
So, don't do crime.

1262
01:45:31,034 --> 01:45:33,728
Live respectable life, understood?

1263
01:45:34,418 --> 01:45:35,765
Yes, sir.

1264
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:50,721
"They didn't grow up,
but had pistols in their hands."

1265
01:45:53,079 --> 01:46:01,631
"They left the house
and wandered in the jungle."

1266
01:46:04,115 --> 01:46:11,390
"Get back the childhood, Oh sir."

1267
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:18,666
"Oh sir, put us to sleep
in mother's drape."

1268
01:46:18,849 --> 01:46:27,325
"Oh sir, sing us a lullaby."

1269
01:46:29,739 --> 01:46:38,796
"Oh sir, please don't leave us."

1270
01:46:40,789 --> 01:46:48,752
"Oh sir, take us to the stars."

1271
01:46:50,514 --> 01:47:01,090
"Oh sir, make us float
in the river Ganges."

1272
01:47:01,346 --> 01:47:12,848
"Oh sir, make us float
in the river Ganges."

1273
01:47:33,315 --> 01:47:35,460
(Laughs)

1274
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:36,861
They died.

1275
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:39,940
(Laughs)

1276
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:41,969
They were after my life.

1277
01:47:43,818 --> 01:47:45,920
Look now, they three are
lying dead on the ground.

1278
01:47:45,945 --> 01:47:50,215
(Laughs)

1279
01:47:51,282 --> 01:47:52,768
I am the God here.

1280
01:47:56,469 --> 01:47:58,672
One who worships me, will live.

1281
01:48:00,999 --> 01:48:06,206
The one who messes with me will meet
the same fate as these three guys.

1282
01:48:07,322 --> 01:48:08,640
Did everyone understand?

1283
01:48:11,330 --> 01:48:13,303
They messed with Lakhan.

1284
01:48:13,845 --> 01:48:17,331
They shout at Lakhan?

1285
01:48:18,001 --> 01:48:20,619
Will you attack Lakhan! You!

1286
01:48:21,941 --> 01:48:23,377
(Laughs)

1287
01:48:27,131 --> 01:48:29,968
Hey, put it down... put it down.

1288
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:31,770
Hey, put it down.

1289
01:48:37,925 --> 01:48:39,741
Hey, stop them.

1290
01:48:40,246 --> 01:48:42,671
Hey, where are they running?

1291
01:49:16,433 --> 01:49:19,036
(Gunshot)
-(Groans)

1292
01:49:41,452 --> 01:49:45,277
(Neha)'A big demon of this small place
is lying dead on the ground.'

1293
01:49:45,513 --> 01:49:47,484
'I have pistol in my hands.'

1294
01:49:48,116 --> 01:49:51,964
'But I am happy that life of two kids
got saved because of me.'

1295
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:55,873
'Even you would've seen
such a kid around you...

1296
01:49:56,123 --> 01:49:58,923
...who is being abused in some
or other way.'

1297
01:49:59,066 --> 01:50:01,635
'If you support any such kid...

1298
01:50:01,832 --> 01:50:04,306
...I'll think that my hard work
was successful.'

1299
01:50:04,591 --> 01:50:08,230
'My fight will continue even
after getting released from jail.'

1300
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:14,868
"Touch the gem of education
with knowledge."

1301
01:50:14,948 --> 01:50:19,128
"Make our lives worth living."

1302
01:50:19,208 --> 01:50:23,442
"Make our lives worth living."

1303
01:50:23,522 --> 01:50:26,717
"Make our lives worth living."

1304
01:50:27,755 --> 01:50:31,387
"Make our lives worth living...

1305
01:50:31,467 --> 01:50:35,312
...by giving education."

1306
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:42,835
"Touch the gem of education
with knowledge."
