1
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,473
Our beloved Sun is 60 years old.
The name of the Sun is Mutha Seth.

2
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:28,276
And the Gods created
him in a leisurely pace

3
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:36,145
Boss, l am not to blame.

4
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,320
Not to blame?

5
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:44,359
The Enquiry Committee's report
lays it on you... all your fault.

6
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,259
Boss... this is wrong !

7
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,064
All right, l'm kicking this upstairs.

8
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:54,630
l'll tell them what you're saying...
it's a committee of assholes.

9
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,441
l didn't say that.
- What else?

10
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:03,009
Honestly, l am... a very honest cop.

11
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:07,310
The one honest cop in all of lndia.
Honestly, what've you done?

12
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,686
She was placed in my charge.

13
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,989
l was always with Madam Elizabeth
when she went for walks,

14
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,995
at lunch and dinner.

15
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,530
l ensured that she
took her medicines timely.

16
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,332
l slogged 24 hours, l stuck with her.
- Then how did Elizabeth get pregnant?

17
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,534
Not my fault.

18
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,269
How come her belly swelled?

19
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,338
l didn't...

20
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,710
Come clean. Who did it?
- No one.

21
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,211
Moron... never read biology in school?

22
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,384
No one did anything, still
she got a swelling? Miracle?

23
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:45,185
lt's a belly, not a balloon.
Who did it to Elizabeth?

24
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,087
Blackie.
- Who's Blackie?

25
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,721
l don't remember him clearly.

26
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:54,130
Bozo, one shot under that
ear and you'll remember.

27
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,296
l was escorting
Elizabeth to the Police Grounds.

28
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,963
On the way, l stopped.

29
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,630
Why?

30
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,232
To eat betel-leaf with betelnut.

31
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,406
Go on.

32
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,143
There was a crowd at the
betel-leaf-betelnut shop.

33
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:10,205
He was making betel-leaf-betelnut
and he was taking his own sweet time.

34
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,108
The shopkeeper...
- ls he Blackie?

35
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:18,055
No! The shopkeeper is a
straight guy, strong, moustachioed.

36
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,352
He only likes wrestling. -

37
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,585
Who likes wrestling? -The shopkeeper.

38
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,027
Get over your shopkeeper!
Make it quick.

39
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,225
l took my betel-leaf with
betelnut and when l turned around,

40
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,324
Elizabeth wasn't there!

41
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,234
What?
- Yes! l was screaming for her...

42
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,205
Elizabeth... Elizabeth madam !
But she was nowhere.

43
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,234
l was walking,
screaming... and then suddenly...

44
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,103
Suddenly...?

45
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,042
There she was, standing under a tree.

46
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,214
Alone?

47
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,217
Boss, this is embarrassing.

48
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,056
She wasn't alone.
- Who else was there?

49
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,290
Blackie was with her.
- Who is Blackie?

50
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,498
Black dog. Mongrel.
- What did you do?

51
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,628
Everything possible! l blew my
whistle! l went at him with my cudgel.

52
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,405
l was about to fire in
the air... but... - What?

53
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,501
By then it was all over.

54
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:17,411
Blackie had shamed
the police department.

55
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:22,619
Constable laik! lt's you ault!

56
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,646
All because of your negligence...

57
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:31,562
Elizabeth the star police bitch
bore a litter of six and she died.

58
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,266
There's no dearth of cunts
like you...

59
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,531
but where will we find one
honest bitch?

60
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,436
Boss, l didn't do anything !

61
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:45,341
Blackie was raping Elizabeth in front
of your eyes and you did nothing?

62
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,209
Get out of here!
- Boss, please save me!

63
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:53,514
This Blackie has destroyed me!
- Then find Blackie! Take off his cap!

64
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,611
Take his cap! Go find Blackie!

65
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,748
- l'll be like a father to
Elizabeth's puppies!

66
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,224
Please, save me!

67
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,262
l told you to keep this vehicle in
shape. The new boss is coming...

68
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,389
He was to have come at 7. Now he's
coming at 6! Doesn't value time!

69
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,457
What are you upto?

70
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,434
Get down and push.

71
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:17,136
Push... give it all you got.

72
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,169
This won't move even a
pubic hair ... pump up the jam.

73
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,978
There's a new boss.

74
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,315
Fist impession is last impession.
Pump it up.

75
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,649
When are we going to get there?

76
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,522
Yusuf Khan here...

77
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,058
speaking... yes.

78
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,492
The officer comes...
car breakdown? Okay.

79
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,294
Sir !

80
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,565
Give me sir, give me...

81
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,034
Welcome to Canda.

82
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,434
Sir... this is Yusuf Khan.

83
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,096
This is welcome...

84
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,335
a traditional welcome.

85
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,345
The local boys dance.

86
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,451
O'Lord, save this spare this poor
soul from the clutches of ghosts.

87
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,624
o! PBlackie las uine me!

88
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:10,484
My wife deserted me because
of Blackie.

89
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,690
Blackie has driven me to the streets.

90
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,627
Now l stand before You !

91
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,000
Help me to find Blackie.

92
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,706
Help me, Lord !

93
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,541
Tell me where he is.
You know everything.

94
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,712
Tell me... where is he?

95
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:41,557
Blackie... is that him?

96
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,152
Blackie... Blackie...

97
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,263
Rafiq, take whatever you want.

98
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,133
Give the rest to the junk dealer.

99
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,537
Professor Shastri's new book.
- Which one?

100
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,136
History or Myths? This
will shake up our society.

101
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,976
Nothing can shake our society.

102
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:08,278
l'm writing an article on this book.
- No place for that in my newspaper.

103
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,015
This newspaper is changing.

104
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,583
Write on astrology.
- l know nothing about it.

105
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,187
l don't believe in astrology.
- You needn't.

106
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,529
Only paint a rosy future.
No one will complain.

107
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:25,435
Must be Mutha Seth.
Tell him l left long ago.

108
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:35,370
Ye faithful shall be rewarded with
health, long life and prosperity.

109
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,717
And rice and grains and
profits from all ventures.

110
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,580
And a life of many pleasures.

111
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,629
Stop.

112
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,397
Welcome... welcome sir.
- This is not necessary.

113
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,440
Have l come to the wrong place?
- No sir! Please come in.

114
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,669
Sawant, what's going on inside?

115
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,374
Puja (A Hindu prayer)

116
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:11,109
You enter at the correct time!
Today is most auspicious.

117
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,515
A sacred day...

118
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,615
A holi day. And you are welcome.

119
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,427
Why a religious ceremony in a
police station? - lt is a tradition.

120
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,626
Come in, si.

121
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,393
lat i sometlin g lappens out tlee
- ike lat

122
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,259
What will happen?

123
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:36,274
lt's nothing... look up
and behold ! God is there.

124
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,277
Look within... God is there.

125
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,042
Come si, come unto Go.

126
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,584
Go in... stay inside.

127
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,625
We invoke the blessings of our Gurus
and in the name of God we shall pray

128
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,393
We also seek the
blessings of the Goddesses.

129
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,034
Tell everyone to get to work.

130
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,298
No tensions about work.

131
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,710
God takes care of everything.
- Sawant, they must get back to work.

132
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:21,177
Yes, immediately after the ceremony.
- Right now. Start work.

133
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,716
God help us.

134
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:30,024
Glory to the Gods,
the Most Benevolent,

135
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,360
Givers of all my life's wishes

136
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,400
We worship your golden idols
with sandalwood and vermilion.

137
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:48,112
What? Are you insisting that
our newspaper has changed?

138
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,209
l don't see any change.
Today's like any other day.

139
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:58,548
No sir! Look at this paper...
- That thing is looking to ruin me.

140
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:02,584
Unlike you, l'm no intellectual.

141
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,654
l'm uneducated. l sold
animal fodder to succeed in life.

142
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:11,635
l've stopped printing
serious articles.

143
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:17,374
l'm trying to push light reading.
l have changed the style totally.

144
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:21,679
Then why isn't my paper selling?

145
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:27,250
The advertisers have run away.
Circulation is dwindling.

146
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,653
A day will come when you
alone will read my paper.

147
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,321
Building a circulation
takes some time, sir.

148
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,561
l've been hearing that for 6 months.

149
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:44,394
How long? Until after
we're dead and gone?

150
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,138
Why did l summon you so urgently?

151
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,566
Why?

152
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,541
Why? Why?

153
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,371
Had you arrived urgently,
l'd remember.

154
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,112
Should l wait?
- lf you have work, run along.

155
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,448
l'll call you when l remember.
And come pronto.

156
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,419
Sure, sir.

157
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,655
Shut him up.

158
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,320
Yes, l remember! Kulkarni...

159
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,026
Meet Deshpande.

160
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,733
Who...? - lf you ask too
many questions, l'll forget.

161
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,195
What was l talking of...?

162
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,671
Deshpande...?
- Yes him.

163
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,403
He is a marketing man...

164
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,412
Educated abroad or something
like that.

165
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:33,451
Kulkarni, you are wise. Keep your
values and principles to yourself.

166
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,577
And listen to him.

167
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,679
But sir...
- Don't ask too many questions. Work.

168
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,358
And listen... say hello to him.

169
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,371
There he comes again.
- Go.

170
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,418
Comfortable?
- Go.

171
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,519
Badshah... Badshah-boss...
- What?

172
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,054
That horse-cart-wallah
Hamid is stone drunk.

173
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,598
Warn him ! lf he doesn't pay his booze
bills, l'll confiscate his horse cart.

174
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,935
Now get lost!

175
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,542
Come in Shabbo.

176
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,447
Shop inauguration done? - Not
shop. You call a studio a studio.

177
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,273
Whatever, but now you're on.
- Except an auspicious offering.

178
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,684
What is that?
- The first photo has got to be yours.

179
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:43,714
Then do it quickly.

180
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:48,255
Sit in the lmpala.

181
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,319
Shabbo, that's an lmpala car.
Not your dad's horse-cart.

182
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,221
Prashant, never ridicule my dad.

183
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,493
Sorry!

184
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,167
Relax Shabbo, no tensions.
You own that car.

185
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,228
Spread your arms, like
ladies who own cars.

186
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:05,266
What's this lmpala on the inside?
The nails on the bench are pricking.

187
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:12,575
Then pretend as if it isn't pricking.
Not even nails can hurt lovers.

188
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,215
Don't give me one-liners.
Take the photo.

189
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,549
Come on.

190
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,557
You took the photo?
- lt's perfectly okay.

191
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,525
How could you just snap it?
- Why?

192
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,621
The big photo-wallahs say smile
-smile and all that. Then they click.

193
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,997
You can't get a thing right.

194
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:32,368
Shabbo, you're smiling 24*7.
No point telling you to smile.

195
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,067
Come on, sit on the moon.
You'll see when the photo is done.

196
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:41,078
Send it to Bombay. Bollywood
producers will line up for you.

197
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,615
When they come,
they'll hire Hamid's cart.

198
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,650
- l warned you,
never ridicule my dad.

199
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:51,315
Put on these sandals. l bought them.
You'll look like a fairy.

200
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,126
Now lie down on the moon.
You look pretty.

201
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,225
Shabbo on a slice of moon.

202
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,390
Hey, l'm afraid... what if l fall?

203
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:05,699
lf you drop off the moon
you'll dangle in space.

204
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:10,631
Prashant, will you leave me dangling?
- How can l? l love you.

205
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,643
ou'e my leoine.
- ia.

206
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,340
Me, a liar?
Just ask whatever you wish.

207
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,982
A spin around the world in
that copter?

208
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,613
l'll gift Taj Mahal to you.
Just ask.

209
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,351
Now recline on the moon.
This photo l must have.

210
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,623
You're looking beautiful...
- Wait... sorry!

211
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,063
l want my photos taken.
l am going to Dubai.

212
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,596
But here's romance in broad
daylight. Boy Hindu-girl Muslim.

213
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,571
Story in a film !

214
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,132
These films are driving
you out of your minds.

215
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,279
lf you Hindus walk away with
our women,

216
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,717
what will we do?
Stay unmarried?

217
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,550
Stay... Don't go against your own
people. Sit tight... click this photo!

218
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,356
Do it.

219
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:08,128
Film is same, stoy is same. nly,
eal leo eplaces tle ake leo.

220
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,068
Take this photo... is
your camera paralysed?

221
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,469
Snap to it!

222
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,305
Badshah-boss...
- What is it?

223
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,072
The cops have confiscated our hooch.
lnspector Sawant wants a bribe.

224
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,579
He wants you at the police station.
- l'll sort you out later.

225
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:33,022
No more credit for
hooch at Badshah-boss' pub.

226
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,386
Here goes Hamid again...

227
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,735
Who is this idiot?
- Don't call him names.

228
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,532
Big political leader.

229
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:52,441
lf anyone overhears, we're screwed.
- When he broke his arm, l fixed him.

230
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,640
Caeul, lis lea ill topple.

231
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:03,683
H e keeps tunin g in tle in .
et, iglt, cente.

232
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:08,557
l said, size it down. But no,
he always wants it bigger.

233
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,562
Now this bugger is disproportionate..
can't even hold his own weight.

234
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,157
Nail his backside.

235
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:19,233
No use. Screw his rear, his front,
or slug it right into his mouth...

236
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,067
all le ill.

237
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,173
Tinker with history and you're damned.

238
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,047
Shame on Professor Shastri.
Down with the deaf professor!

239
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,465
Now, what do you want?

240
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,428
Ban.

241
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,497
Have you read the book?
- Several times.

242
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,244
Each time l have felt ashamed.

243
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:03,304
ook outsie, see tle
an ge oe you listoy.

244
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:10,618
Not just my history, it's yours too.
- No. Our history is different.

245
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,320
Our history is glorious.

246
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,553
A history of sacrifice, valor...

247
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,689
inspires us to fight,
gives us strength to survive.

248
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:29,307
l write about history.
l do not concoct myths.

249
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,099
What use is showcasing a few
mistakes of our ancestors?

250
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,578
What use hiding those historical
mistakes?

251
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,105
- Why are you digging up dead bodies?

252
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:44,144
Why are you spreading this venom?
You have hurt our feelings.

253
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,717
History isn't written to
please anyone.

254
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,461
Enough of these histories!

255
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:59,999
True or not, we won't
tolerate a history that defames us.

256
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,901
l reasoned with them. That is why
they are only burning your book.

257
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:13,646
Those who hurt religious
beliefs are annihilated.

258
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,458
What is in this rubbish history?
l am so ashamed.

259
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,396
Shame on Professor Shastri !

260
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:41,470
Those who play with
history will be reduced to ashes.

261
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,614
Where are you off to?

262
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,353
There has been a big accident.

263
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,255
Who will do your job? Your father?

264
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,462
My father has met with an accident.

265
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,124
Which father?

266
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,729
Hamid, the horse-cart-wallah
He is dead.

267
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,196
Hamid? How could he be your father?

268
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,373
Your father died 1 8
years ago, in police firing.

269
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,176
Yes...
- Then...?

270
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,378
My mother married Hamid.

271
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:20,714
Do you get a new father every
time your mother gets a new husband?

272
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,982
Get to work.

273
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,122
Why are you staring at me?

274
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,625
l need 400 Rupees.

275
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,492
What for?

276
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,962
The funeral.

277
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,425
400 bucks! Are you throwing a party?

278
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,530
That's 500.

279
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,143
Come back quickly.
Right after the burial.

280
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,448
Caeul, please be caeul.

281
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,514
Put him down carefully.

282
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,260
Put him down carefully.

283
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,730
Stop! No! Don't!

284
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,175
Don't bury the dead man.

285
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,507
We want the dead man's body.

286
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,608
What happened...?

287
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,713
What is the matter?
- Give us the corpse.

288
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,951
The corpse is in the grave.
- Why?

289
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:36,658
The man died. So he was buried.

290
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,094
With whose permission
are you burying him?

291
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,420
Permission?
- Yes!

292
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,627
The body was given to us
after post mortem.

293
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,727
What other permission is needed?

294
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,637
Who is the man you buried?
- Hamid.

295
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:52,143
He isn't Hamid.
- What do you mean?

296
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,668
He is Kishan, a Hindu.
He isn't Hamid.

297
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,778
This is Anwar. His son.
- Was he your father?

298
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,247
Everyone knows.
Hamid lived amongst us.

299
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,348
Every Hindu living around you will
be converted to lslam and buried?

300
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,620
Let's go.

301
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,267
One minute.

302
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,498
Bring out the body.

303
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,096
The body can't come out.

304
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:28,204
Go on, start saying the prayers.
- Don't. Wait.

305
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,243
What are you doing here?
Go home.

306
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:35,753
Kishan was one of us.
His dead body is ours.

307
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,584
Throw them out.

308
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,393
Come on. - Kishan was
a Hindu. We want his body.

309
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:49,167
He has been buried.
We cannot remove him.

310
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,567
Body will be retrieved. From hell,
if need be! Government orders.

311
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,129
That'd be wrong.
- No tensions. Bring out the body.

312
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,272
This is against religion.

313
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,647
Give us Kishan's body!
- Give him to us!

314
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,707
Send Muslims to their proper place.
- Pakistan, or their graves.

315
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,079
Send Muslims to their proper place.
- Pakistan, or their graves.

316
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,353
Send Muslims to their proper place.
- Pakistan, or their graves.

317
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,698
Kishan was my brother.
4 years older to me.

318
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:33,168

Fatima... sle is a uslim oman.

319
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,975

Fo lo lon g i le lie itl le

321
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,115
1 9 or 20 years.

322
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,280
Did Hamid convert?

323
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,225
Not Hamid. Kishan.
- Kishan...

324
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,290
Did Kishan become a Muslim?

325
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:59,127
ls this grilling necessary? He says,
Kishan was his brother. Period.

326
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:06,066
Why won't you trust a
simple law-fearing man?

327
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,970
Are you with Muslim goons
who buried him?

328
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:14,178
ls that why you're after
this poor man?

329
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:18,052
We won't allow this
to happen. Understand?

330
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:22,253
Return his body immediately.
We demand it.

331
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,993
This is between Laxman and
the police. Who are you?

332
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,660
This isn't a matter
involving only Laxman.

333
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,561
Kishan was a part of the fraternity.
He was a brother to all Hindus.

334
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,163
Therefore we deserve
his body. Understand?

335
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:42,474
Mr Sattar, AsSalamu Allaikum.
- Wallaikum AsSalaam, Mr Bavdekar.

336
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:47,507
Are you stoking the embers? - Your
Muslims are. l'm trying to douse it.

337
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,287
l was in Bombay, to
meet the chief minister.

338
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,220
Had l been here... l'd
never have let this happen.

339
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,623
And you... you've just arrived.
You've trusted this Satan?

340
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,130
You dared to dig out our body?

341
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:06,637
You're lucky that the word hasn't
gotten around. You have insulted us...

342
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,505
Apologize right now. Return our body.

343
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:17,037
While you take his body away,
you expect us to chant hyms?

344
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:23,686
lf we do not get the body, then you
are responsible for what is to follow.

345
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,018
Until this is decided,
we'll keep it in the morgue.

346
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:36,330
Why? Body is ours,
body's brother is with us!

347
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,030
We must get the body.
- Go to court.

348
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,236
Convince the judge. The body is yours.

349
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:51,514
The body is ours. Why
should we go to court?

350
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,085
ls tle cout bigge tlan eligion

351
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:59,454
You are taking this
decision to please the Muslims.

352
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:06,220
You policemen and these
Muslims will seriously regret this.

353
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:32,179
Fatima! l, lat las lappene

354
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:40,191
No one ever thought this could happen !

355
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,260
lnstead of coming home,

356
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,304
he landed there and suddenly
the photo had to fall...

357
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,631
and of all people,
it had to kill Hamid.

358
00:26:53,078 --> 00:27:01,952
Each man... drawn to his death.
- Why does it happen only to the poor?

359
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:09,155
ln this world, a poor man has no one.
- We have no one.

360
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:14,557
Tle police kille Fatima's
ist lusban .

361
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,966
Now, the leader has crushed
the second.

362
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,329
Poor thing, what can she do?
- Cry, cry your heart out.

363
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:26,002
Think of him and cry!
- Cry out loud...

364
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:33,274
As long as he was alive,
the police never touched him.

365
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:38,351
After he died, they've
locked him in prison !

366
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:44,188
Allah ! What woes have come upon us!

367
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,427
Such troublesome times.

368
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,530
AsSalaamu Allaikum.

369
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,972
What've you decided?

370
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,181
Nothing.

371
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,076
What?

372
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,220
We haven't decided anything.

373
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:19,959
They pulled Shabbo's dad out of
his grave and you're undecided?

374
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,702
My mother says, let by gones be.

375
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,898
He is dead and gone.

376
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:37,174
What use bickering
over burial or cremation?

377
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:43,920
May his soul...
- Allah ! May his soul find peace.

378
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,420
The man died because
of an electric shock.

379
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,224
The government will pay 50 or 60,000.

380
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,625
lf you keep crying over it, the
Hindus will swallow the money.

381
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,664
Don't let them swallow the money.
- Not the Hindus.

382
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,406
Are you mourning with your mother?

383
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,343
Let Shabbo stay here. Come along.

384
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,976
Come on.

385
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,882
Anwar, you won't go.

386
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,641
Don't hold back the sorrow, Fatima.

387
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,702
Let it pour out.

388
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,514
lt's your fate... you are destined
to cry. - Remember him... and weep.

389
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,917
The water is flowing.

390
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:52,148
We got to collect the water.
Let's go. We'll come by tonight.

391
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:57,019
Come on, it's water. lf the
water runs out, then we've had it.

392
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,259
The water supply is only for an hour.

393
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,594
- Relana, inisl tle clapte
om Koan.

394
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,693
We must go, or we'll miss
the water. See you at night.

395
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:11,675
Rafiq... what a photo!

396
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:17,238
What's your book about?
Exploits of dancing girls?

397
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:22,211
No. Exploitation of dancing girls.

398
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:26,388
You are a Muslim. Stick to romantic
poetry. Why chase dancing girls?

399
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,524

400
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,957
That's the problem with researchers.

401
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,523
What should
be on the cover, you hide it inside.

402
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,999
This semi-nude photo...
splash it on the cover.

Fom tomoo, pint sucl

404
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,678
Rafiq, l am going to Baba
Desai's memorial service.

405
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,446
Baba Desai's death is going to
be tomorrow's headline news.

406
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,641
The material is all ready.

407
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,708
l'll get you a few more reactions.
- Not needed.

408
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,446
l have the front page news.
- What do you mean?

409
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,257
A Hindu
horse-cart-wallah was electrocuted.

410
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,624
And Muslims gave him a burial.

411
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,054
ls this front page news?
- Yes, front page.

412
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:10,532
And Baba Desai's death?
- Not on front page. Elsewhere.

413
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,063
Baba Desai was a freedom fighter.
He worked with Mahatma Gandhi.

414
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,370
He worked lifelong for the country.
- Cool.

415
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:24,147
A great man. My respects.
But what to do?

416
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,644
Nowadays, there's no
market for patriotism.

417
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,711
Look at this...

418
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:37,024
Baba Desai 98, was
bed-ridden for 8 years. Now dead.

419
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:41,020
Where is the news? What is the news?

420
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:45,129
Great man, no doubt. But
his news is insignificant.

421
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,172
But the horse-cart-wallah
lnsignificant man. Bigtime news.

422
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,699
Know this Kulkarni.

423
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,738
News is important. Not the man.
- Okay, thank you.

424
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,975
But a horse-cart-wallah's
story isn't going on my front page.

425
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,146
Hello, Kulkarni...

426
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,151
Drop that ego.

427
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,679
What you think, what l
think doesn't mean a thing.

428
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,720
What people wish to
read is more important.

429
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,594
As a marketing man...
- l am the editor.

430
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,225
l get to decide what they get to read.

431
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,739
Rafiq...?
- Done.

432
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,510
Everyone who lives in lndia,
is a Hindu.

433
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,280
This is a court.
No lecturing in court.

434
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,753
Hamid was a Muslim.
- Any proof?

435
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,483
Every child knows.

436
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,355
This is a court. Not a
place for child's play.

437
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,327
Did he have a birth certificate?
- No.

438
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,262
When a man is born...

439
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,960
you need a birth certificate.
Yes, or no?

440
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,702
Kishan was poor. How does a
poor man procure a certificate?

441
00:32:54,038 --> 00:33:00,534
How do the rich procure a certificate?
Are they born clutching certificates?

442
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,672
Any school-leaving certificate?
- Kishan never went to school.

443
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,184
Who will give him a
school-leaving certificate?

444
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,378
Why didn't he go to school?

445
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,546
There was no school in the village.

446
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:13,146
Yes, there was a
school in a village nearby.

447
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,658
Why didn't he go there?
- A big river flowed in-between.

448
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,525
Why didn't he learn how to swim?
- There was no water in the river.

449
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,929
Then why call it a river?

450
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,361
lt is commonly called as river.

451
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,432
And worshipped.
- Any proof?

452
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,199
Yes, in ancient Hindu texts.

453
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:37,674
A Muslim Hamid in ancient Hindu texts?
- Not Hamid. The river.

454
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:43,242
What are we enquiring into?
Hamid, or the river?

455
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,144
Hamid.
- Yes.

456
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,658
Did he have a driving licence?
- Hamid plied a horse-cart.

457
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,723
Hose pulle tle cat.
icen ce asn't neee.

458
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,064
This ration card mentions his name.

459
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,201
The horse's ration card?
- Hamid's.

460
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,704
lt's a fake ration card.
Costs 25 bucks.

461
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,145
Hamid went to the mosque every Friday.

462
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,644
Lies! Kishan was a
devotee of Lord Ganesha.

463
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:18,080
He went to temples on
Tuesdays and danced at festivals.

464
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,720
He mourned and beat himself
bloody during Moharram ceremonies.

465
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,491
Hamid was jobless, poor.

466
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,655
The Muslims tempted him with alcohol,

467
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,394
lured him with marriage and money,
sold him dreams of a heaven.

468
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:36,402
Now they remember Kishan. He
was poor, jobless, hungry...

469
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,704
Why didn't you help your Hindu friend?

470
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:44,609
You discriminated. Tormented him.
Sick and tired, he became a Muslim.

471
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,379
He never converted. He
remained a true Hindu.

472
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,154
Any proof that he converted?

473
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:58,291
l performed the rites of conversion.
He became a Muslim, married Fatima.

474
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,928
No circumcision reported...

475
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,600
what you do to the foreskin...
- A male is circumsized.

476
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,570
The post mortem
doesn't mention circumcision.

477
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,607
Because he was a grown man,
he wasn't circumsized.

478
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,939
lf he wasn't circumsized,
how did he become a Muslim?

479
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:18,648
A symbolic circumcision was
performed by chopping a betelnut.

480
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,445
Where is the chopped betelnut?

481
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,714
Hamid was fond of eating betelnut.

482
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,649
There is no proof of Hamid's birth.

483
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,386
There is no proof
that he became a Muslim.

484
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,692
There is no proof of his wedding.

485
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,331
No water in the river, no
circumcision, betelnut...

486
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,364
How can l give a verdict? You tell me.

487
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:41,405
Tell me.

488
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,091
Rafiq ! What is this?

489
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,234
How did the headline change?

490
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:20,008
Who is the editor? Me, or Deshpande?
Whose orders are you obeying?

491
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:26,173
Deshpande... damn that Deshpande!

492
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:32,249

494
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,125
Screw him !

495
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:45,431
Do you know what an editor is?
l'm not the publisher's dog !

496
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:51,301
l always carry my
resignation letter inside my pocket.

497
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,267
What...?

498
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,402
Hello...

499
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,179
Hello...

500
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,047
What?

501
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,014
What was that?

502
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,990
A conspiracy to throw me out?

503
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,658
How do you know...?

504
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,063
All right...

505
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:21,629
All right... don't tell anyone
anything.

506
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:29,070
Don't even let out
that we talked on phone.

507
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,111
You get it? Good.

508
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,963
Come Tommy, come.

509
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,134
Come here, boy. Come on.

510
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,664
Sit.

511
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,272
Sit there. Sit.

512
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,466
Kulkarni, sit.

513
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,975
Yes thank you, sir.

514
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,179
Tommy, now don't move.

515
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,881
Good boy.

516
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,965
New dog. lmported.

517
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,967
l had two before him. lndian dogs.

518
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,536
These lndian dogs can't be trained.

519
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,113
Bit me twice.

520
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,948
He is imported. l will train him.

521
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,489
Tommy, sit there.

522
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,556
Sit.

523
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,591
Kulkarni...

524
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,567
Your wife was in a
hospital and l wasn't informed...?

525
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,463
She's better now.

526
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,602
l don't like being
informed by outsiders.

527
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,550
She is like a sister to me. And
you don't even think of informing me?

528
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,611
l didn't mean it that way.
- What do you mean?

529
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,654
You are always tense. You are tired.

530
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:30,165
Certainly not, sir.
- The strain is showing.

531
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:34,268
You need rest. Take a holiday.

532
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:38,902
Paid holiday. Sanctioned.
- l don't need a holiday.

533
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:44,237
That foreign-returned Deshpande...
he will manage everything.

534
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,174
What will Deshpande manage...

535
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,045
l mean...

536
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:56,253
Does he have any idea about
local culture, politics, history? No.

537
00:39:57,194 --> 00:40:00,686
The paper sold like hotcakes today.
Why?

538
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,693
Because l took a risk. l put
the horse-cart-wallah's news...

539
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,263
on the front page.

540
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,567
lt worked.

541
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,369
ocal issues, si.

542
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,369
People are more
interested in local issues.

543
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:15,071
Not in Baba Desai's death.

544
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,512
Baba Desai is history.

545
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,719
Your doing?
- Yes.

546
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:29,656
My telephone has been ringing all day.

547
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,720
Yes, sales have increased.

548
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,694
Good job. l'm enjoying this.

549
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:46,373
Kulkarni, your scooter is obsolete.

550
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,543
Getting it kickstarted is an effort.

551
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,314
And by the time it starts,
the news is stale.

552
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,310
Today, we need speed. Speed.

553
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:04,619
Dump the scooter. l'll
make arrangements for a car.

554
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,328
Thank you, sir.

555
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,126
Tommy! Go now!

556
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,968
Go from here. Go! Don't come.

557
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,138
ldiot.

558
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:21,604
You can go now.

559
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,177
Yes.

560
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,673
Listen...

561
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:33,751
Send your wife's hospital
bills to my accounts department.

562
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,557
Okay, thank you sir.

563
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:45,667
Tommy, come my son. Come on.

564
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,538
Come back, boy. Come on.

565
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,471
l am sorry. Sorry.

566
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,205
ook, it's you ploto in tle pape.

567
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,248
You're looking pretty.

568
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:02,247
lt doesn't write pretty things
about you. - What did they write?

569
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:08,222
You can't read. Good for you.
- What did they write?

570
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:15,429
A Hindu horse-cart-wallah's lady,
a wanton woman, a lady.

571
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:20,567
You are the root of all evil.
- Do you think this is true?

572
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,603
Tell me, do you think it is true?

573
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,614
- They say,
newspapers write only truth.

574
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,249
Do you trust the paper
more than your mother?

575
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:44,184
And they say that l am a idiot.

576
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,754
My boss just fired me.

577
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,559
Everyone's saying that
no one will employ me.

578
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,165
All because of you.

579
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,509
Son, you are cursing me.

580
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,109
l'm going away. Don't wait for me.

581
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:36,674
The truth has triumphed.
- The verdict is out.

582
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:40,740
What are you waiting for? lt's
been 4 days since Kishan died.

583
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,676
How long will Hindus
wait to mourn their dead?

584
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,282
Give up the body.

585
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,717
What's your hurry?
- Haven't you heard the verdict?

586
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,427
You will take the body
and you will cremate it.

587
00:43:55,265 --> 00:44:01,135
lf the upper court favors the Muslims,
which body will we give them to bury?

588
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:05,301
Worrying for Muslims?
You don't care for Hindus?

589
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:09,506
Nothing is above the courts.
The court has ruled.

590
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,941
Give us our body.
- Don't!

591
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,409
No! We don't accept this
court's ruling.

592
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,715
Mr. Sattar is appealing in
higher courts.

593
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:21,351
lf you fix the next verdict,
then we will fight.

594
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,417
But we won't give up our body!
We're going all the way!

595
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:29,956
Go where you belong.
- Go away to Pakistan. Leave us!

596
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,633
But we are taking our body.

597
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,602
Mind you !
lf we don't get our body,

598
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,508
we'll bury the whole lot
of them alive!

599
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:43,444
En masse, in one
huge world-famous grave!

600
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:49,043
Enough. Get out of here.
The body stays in the morgue.

601
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,980
Out.

602
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:59,028
Anyone who rises against our body...
- Will crumble to dust.

603
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,389
lt belongs to us... we
won't give up what is ours!

604
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,138
lt's ours!

605
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,641
We will not give up our body!

606
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,502
Becoming a big leader?

607
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:18,009
Threatening the police?

608
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,679
You circumcised Muslim pimp.

609
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,245
Damn you !

610
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:29,453
You want to end up with
your body in the morgue?

611
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,624
Vanish !

612
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:46,303
Why don't you say something?
- What is there to say?

613
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:54,515
l made a mistake coming
here to you on the sly.

614
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,952
Thank you, Shabbo.
- l didn't come here to sit mum.

615
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,191
Then speak.
- No, l won't.

616
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:09,557
Then, start a quarrel.
- You mean l come to you to quarrel?

617
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:14,036
Am l the one always quarreling?
Am l bad? Quarrelsome?

618
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,439
Enough. l won't come to
see you anymore. - Why not?

619
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:25,646
Have you gone blind? Don't you see?
- What happened?

620
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:31,219
The two parties are getting into
a fight. - How are we concerned?

621
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,555
What will my people say
if they find us? - What?

622
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,920
That l'm seeing the other
party on the sly.

623
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,396
- What do you mean...
other party?

624
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,623
Your party.

625
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,101
When did l become another party?

626
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:53,740
Then where do you belong?
- l neither belong here, nor there.

627
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,545
Mine's a third party.
- Third party?

628
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,675
The party of those in love.

629
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,687
ook, een len e quael,
it's o loe.

630
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,690
We're fighting to get closer,
not to stay apart.

631
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,091
Really?

632
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,393
Or, was that a one-liner?
- l swear, by you.

633
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:20,365
Prashant... will you
take me in your party?

634
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,672
Entry isn't free.
- But my purse is empty.

635
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:28,339
Not the purse. The heart.
You got to be rich at heart.

636
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,914
Shabbo...

637
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,619
Will you stay with me lifelong?

638
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:41,385
Take me away. Right now.
- Where?

639
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:46,729
Someplace far away. Over here,
l'm suffocating.

640
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:51,598
Take me away.
- Not right now.

641
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:55,629
You're backtracking.
- l'm not.

642
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,137
When the time is right,
l'll come for you.

643
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:03,543
But not on the sly. l'll go to
your house with a wedding band.

644
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,115
Listen...

645
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:10,214
l bought a ring for you at the fair.

646
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,481
Don't laugh. lt's inexpensive.

647
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:19,889
But magical.
- A magic ring?

648
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,061
What will it bring?

649
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,995
Help for you in times
of trouble. Wear it.

650
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,888
Tle cue is on...
om pm till  am.

651
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,462
No one here.

652
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,296
Anwar?

653
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,930
Anwar... what are you doing here?

654
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,566
l didn't do anything.

655
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,437
Did you start that?

656
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:43,144
Caught red-handed. Curfew violation.

657
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:49,447
So what if he is a Muslim like you?
Show us you're man enough.

658
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,578
Are you man enough?
- No...

659
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,519
What are you doing here?

660
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:58,721
ldiot! Do you want to
become a goon? A goon? Take that.

661
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,924
And burn down houses... shops?

662
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,063
Hit harder.

663
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,630
Who else is with you?

664
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,606
Bravo! He is loyal.

665
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,172
Oh mother...

666
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,344
Speak up, or l'm going to kill you !

667
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,382
Who is there with you?

668
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,678
Talk.

669
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,181
Who is there with you?

670
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:58,312
ln this country, anything that
belongs to Muslims is being grabbed...

671
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:02,222
everything...mosques,
shrines, schools,

672
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:07,327
even our burial grounds.

673
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,458
They even kidnapped Hamid's corpse.

674
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:17,633
lf you remain silent, then one day...

675
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,369
one fine day, they'll even abduct you.

676
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,611
And do you know what they will say?

677
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:30,642
Your forefathers were Hindu.
You are Hindu.

678
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:36,057
Worship idols. Sing Hindu hyms.

679
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:40,728
Conspiracy! This is a
conspiracy to destroy you !

680
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,998
Mr Preacher...one minute...

681
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:47,193
Sorry, nothing of that
sort is happening here.

682
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:48,765
You have come from another city.

683
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,266
You don't know about our problems.

684
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,735
So, please don't make
a speech to instigate.

685
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,636
Rafiq, sit. Pipe down.

686
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:04,186
Why is this happening to Muslims?

687
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:10,185
Have you ever thought? Ever wondered?
Why it's happening only to Muslims?

688
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,961
Because the mosques are going empty

689
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:18,261
At the times of prayer,
no one is seen there.

690
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:24,570
Muslims have forgotten Allah, they've
forsaken prayer and abstinence.

691
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:28,509
Muslims are floundering... lost.

692
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:35,213
Muslim women have forsaken the veil.

693
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:42,690
Remember the sacrifices Muslims made.

694
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,395
What we Muslims were...
and what we have become.

695
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:51,400
What have we become?

696
00:52:52,235 --> 00:53:00,335
ln Muslim localities, in Muslim homes,
there is singing, dancing, music!

697
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:06,342
The singers are Muslim, the musicians,
the dancers all Muslim !

698
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,441
And the audience is Muslim.

699
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:14,952
Muslims drink alcohol.
Muslims sell alcohol.

700
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,423
Apocalypse is upon us.

701
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:21,629
This is the sign of the end !

702
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,594
A warrior of lslam in the battlefield

703
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:32,336
and a devout in the mosque
is a true Muslim.

704
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:37,576
O' true followers, protect your faith.

705
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:41,447
Put fear in the
hearts of Allah's enemies.

706
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,145
Fo tley ae you enemies too.

707
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,085
l call for battle, for jihad !

708
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:49,057
Mr Preacher, you should speak of
things that will improve their lives.

709
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:53,192
Why are you twisting facts and
instigating these simple folks?

710
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,288
This religion talks about humanism,

711
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,526
peace, about the rights of the
weak and poor.

712
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:01,626
What are you reducing it to?
Aren't you ashamed?

713
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,967
Shut up!

714
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:10,246
Throw out this hypocrite! Men
like him are enemies of lslam.

715
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:14,340
He speaks of making peace
with the enemy? - Go outside.

716
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,715
Shut up!

717
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:20,244
You are the man who lives
among the Hindus. Don't you preach !

718
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,581
What is he saying?

719
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:26,493
During riots, he comes running
to us to save his life. Coward !

720
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,726
But lslam isn't about...
- What do you know of lslam?

721
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,533
Do you even relate to Muslims?
Get out!

722
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,566
Journalist.
- Don't let him in.

723
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:44,640
Muslims like him are the
biggest enemies of lslam.

724
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:50,117
They talk of peace, to
threaten us. Peace with the enemy?

725
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,582
Afraid? Are you afraid of death?

726
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,626
Such obsessive love of
life isn't good.

727
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,257
Think of afterlife, of heaven.

728
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:08,702
You will be given 70 celestial maidens.

729
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,298
How many?
- 1 7.

730
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:15,006
Not 1 7.Seventy.

731
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,067
Seventy.

732
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,138
Seventy heaven lyhouries!

733
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:23,675
ln the embrace of your
wasting wives, you forget Allah?

734
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:30,220
You salivate over photos of
whores and watch their movies!

735
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:36,129
To fantasize? Take from
life only as much is needed.

736
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:41,569
And focus on heaven, on
how to attain that heaven...

737
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:48,404
where the beauty of the
houries is beyond imagination.

738
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:52,611
You see one of these beauties,
then you turn away.

739
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,944
When you see her again...

740
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,510
Do you understand what l am saying?

741
00:55:56,586 --> 00:56:03,424
No...? Let me explain.
You see a beauty...

742
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,591
after seeing her... you turn away.

743
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,530
When you look at her again,

744
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:16,630
she is 70 times more enticing !

745
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:22,305
May Allah send all of you to heaven.

746
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,545
Fom tlis ay, no one ill
atcl cinema.

747
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,549
No one will watch television.

748
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,950
Women won't step
outside homes without veils.

749
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:36,181
Girls cannot study
in non-Muslim schools.

750
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:40,628
No one will sing, no one will
play music. No one will dance.

751
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:44,660
Mark my words.

752
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:50,165
Once you step outside, do not forget.

753
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,738
Rafiq,

754
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,684
Stop writing against these people.

755
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,353
Stop writing?

756
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,088
Stop telling the truth?

757
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,062
Then what is the point of my life?

758
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,054
Blackie...

759
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,459
Blackie...

760
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,628
Blackie...

761
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,292
Blackie...

762
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,061
Blackie...

763
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,956
The thief!

764
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,557
Pandu !

765
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:23,259
Hey Pandu...
- l have stopped stealing.

766
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:27,133
l'm not a thief anymore,
l swear by God !

767
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:31,936
l've given it up. l am not a thief.

768
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:41,083
You are thief no more,
l'm no more a cop.

769
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:46,545
lt's destiny's game.
- What are you getting at?

770
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,088
How can l explain this?

771
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:57,061
l lost my job because of Blackie
and l'm on the streets right now.

772
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,565
Blackie... have you seen him?

773
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:09,636
You must've seen him... a
black mongrel, coal-black!

774
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:15,081
Pandu, you are a thief.
- Okay, then...?

775
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:19,218
A thief in any village
will know all the dogs.

776
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:25,358
You must know Blackie...
tell me where he is...

777
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,293
Where is he?

778
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:34,569
Blackie... inside the tape-recorder?

779
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,573
ls that you in there, Blackie?

780
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,177
Please send a constable, quickly!

781
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,109
What happened?

782
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:46,637
Outside the morgue...
- What happened there?

783
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,949
Wasn't a constable posted
outside the morgue? - Yes.

784
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,689
He ran away.
- Must've gone for a piss.

785
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:58,591
No! Now he's right there...
in front of me!

786
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,527
What do want?

787
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,260
lt's Hamid's ghost! Your
constable is possessed.

788
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,565
The ghost is driving him mad !

789
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,265
He's stripping !

790
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,541
l'm Hamid... horse-cart wallah ! My
soul is suffocating ! Let me out!

791
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,444
Set me free! Or l'll
burn this village down !

792
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,413
There goes my sixth man.

793
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:24,450
The body is all alone. lf anything
happens to it, you'll come hollering.

794
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:30,158
No one wants that job,
because of Hamid's ghost.

795
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,457
et me go! Stop tailin g me!

796
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,287
5 possessed cops are already
at the shrine yelling to

797
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,765
get rid of the ghost.

798
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,729
lt's your duty to take care of this.

799
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,628
Fom lee ill l get anotle cop

800
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,698

eae me.

803
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,741
Let me go.

804
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:06,656
Where is Rafiq?
- He hasn't reported.

805
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,659
F or you.

806
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,263
This the 50th time l'm hearing
this story today.

807
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,364
l don't know the truth.
Ask the police.

808
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,639
l'm exasperated !
- What happened?

809
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,946
There's a rumor doing the rounds.

810
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:29,348
Hamid's ghost possessed a cop
1 1 01 at the morgue.

811
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,451
The possessed cop ran amok
and left the morgue unattended.

812
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:37,357
Sensing an opportunity, the
Muslims stole Hamid's corpse.

813
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,119
lnteresting...

814
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:43,197
And then?

815
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:47,600
The Muslims buried Hamid and put
a duplicate corpse in the morgue.

816
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,298
This rumor has spread everywhere.

817
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,170
lt could actually be true.

818
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,036
This is tomorrow's
headline new son the front page.

819
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,078
Kulkarni...

820
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,420
This isn't news. lt is a rumor.
- Could be true.

821
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,313
What if it turns out to be false?

822
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,688
We'll apologize.

823
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:13,251
Have you weighed the consequences?

824
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,131
lf people think it's true,
this can spark off riots.

825
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,034
Stopping riots is
not a newspaper's job.

826
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,335
There's the government,
the police, the military.

827
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,341
Go on.
- Hey, stop!

828
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,372
l won't let you publish this rumor.

829
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,311
l am the editor.

830
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,546
l am going to complain to Mutha Seth.

831
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:39,647
ly ae you astin g you time
et tle nes out.

832
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:40,620
Go on.

833
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,220
Where is Kishan's body?

834
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,257
What do you want?

835
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:53,295
There is no body here. Stop!
- Where did the Muslims take the body?

836
01:02:54,203 --> 01:03:00,608
This is a ward, for living bodies.
The morgue for dead bodies is outside.

837
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,705
What are you doing?
The patients will die!

838
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:08,973
There is no body here...
it's inside the morgue...

839
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:16,018
We don't care! Give us Kishan's body!

840
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,487
Behold our Lion God in all His glory!

841
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:23,999
Behold the crown of our king !
And bow to His feet!

842
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,636
Behold the Son, our Elephant God !

843
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:32,401
Glory to Him, the giver of wishes.

844
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,403
Quick... you needn't
take too many clothes.

845
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,379
What if this drags on?

846
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:44,544
e aen't goin g aay oee.
et tlin gs cool on, e'll etun.

847
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,247
What if the rioting goes on for long?

848
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,586
What is that? Drop it!
- Just the suitcase.

849
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,216
We'll miss the bus.
- But...

850
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:51,191
Oh, forget everything.

851
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:56,197
Bless us God, give us our wish.
You are the shepherd of orphans.

852
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:02,571
Without You all is lost. You
are the shepherd of orphans.

853
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,405
To You we flock when danger comes.

854
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:10,912
Behold the Mother Goddess,
the slayer of demons.

855
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:17,482
Behold the Mother Goddess,
the slayer of demons.

856
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,615
Did you pack my novel?
- No, l missed it.

857
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,683
What do you mean?
- l left it on the table.

858
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:58,321
l don't even have
another copy. We must go back.

859
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:02,162
We're returning as soon as
it cools down, right?- But...

860
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,392
Just forget it.

861
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:32,504
O'my countrymen, let
tears fill your eyes

862
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:40,010
Remember the sacrifices of our martyrs

863
01:07:55,805 --> 01:08:03,507
Pandu was no ordinary man. lt
takes time to understand a great soul.

864
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:08,342
The police put him in jail
claiming he was a thief.

865
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:12,643
But look at the miracle...
his shackles came off,

866
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:18,489
the iron bars melted. Walls collapsed.
And Pandu was set free.

867
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:23,259
Pandu was born to serve the
Hindu faith.

868
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:27,224
Pandu died serving the religion.

869
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:32,096
Willingly he jumped
into the sacred pyre.

870
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:41,344
We will build a memorial to Pandu.
lt will be a huge monument.

871
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:50,352
As long as Sun and Moon rise,
Pandu's name will shine.

872
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:53,052
Till Sun and Moon rise...

873
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,596
Pandu, your name will shine!

874
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:58,598
Figltin g elentlessly against
eligious conesion,

875
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,636
Kishan became a saint.
Kishan is immortal.

876
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,370
Until we are given his body...

877
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,605
he has decided not to eat.

878
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,106
He will fast unto death.

879
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:16,345
ln lanes and by lanes this
will echo...Kisan is our hero!

880
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,285
ln lanes and by lanes this
will echo... - Kisan is our hero!

881
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:24,456
We don't want riches or homes,
give us Kishan's body.

882
01:09:56,788 --> 01:10:01,623
Sit. Hey old man, sit. How
many times will l repeat? Sit.

883
01:10:01,693 --> 01:10:08,565
Sit... quietly... yes, clap.

884
01:10:12,771 --> 01:10:15,604
l am sad, l am deeply pained.

885
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:18,472
Satta, tlis is no time
o speecles.

886
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:23,543
Hamid dies and he goes to Allah.

887
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:28,881
And this is being whipped into
an issue to persecute Muslims.

888
01:10:29,388 --> 01:10:32,983
But l stand beside you. l
won't let you suffer injustice.

889
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,326
l stand...

890
01:10:37,462 --> 01:10:42,024
l stand accused. l killed Hamid.

891
01:10:42,801 --> 01:10:45,031
Politics of murder!

892
01:10:45,904 --> 01:10:50,500
Hamid died under the
weight of my wooden ''cut-out''.

893
01:10:50,575 --> 01:10:55,842
But the truth is, Hamid died
because of government negligence.

894
01:10:57,682 --> 01:11:01,413
Hamid got an electric shock,
so he died.

895
01:11:01,987 --> 01:11:05,081
Therefore we demand that...

896
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:09,724
..Hamid's son should get
job in Electricity board.

897
01:11:13,098 --> 01:11:17,558
Hamid's family must be given a
compensation of 50,000 Rupees.

898
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:27,570
And this lane must be
named after Hamid. - Clapping.

899
01:11:28,814 --> 01:11:34,719
Fien s, my oice is beakin g.
PBut my couage is unboken.

900
01:11:34,786 --> 01:11:40,986
ls am telling you...
- Sit down.

901
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:46,991
We will have an lslamic
school named after Hamid.

902
01:11:48,033 --> 01:11:51,025
And l will pay for that school.

903
01:11:51,503 --> 01:11:53,528
l will lay the foundation stone.

904
01:11:56,775 --> 01:12:00,370
And every Muslim child
will be schooled there.

905
01:12:02,747 --> 01:12:10,347
We say no to this English education.
We say no to this Satanic education.

906
01:12:12,657 --> 01:12:15,091
This is no time for speeches.

907
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:19,522
Where's biryani?

908
01:12:20,565 --> 01:12:21,463
Say...

909
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,867
Mutha Seth Happy Birthday.

910
01:12:23,935 --> 01:12:25,596
Mutha Seth Happy Birthday.

911
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,035
Mutha Seth Happy Birthday.

912
01:12:27,105 --> 01:12:30,040
Mutha Seth Happy Birthday.

913
01:12:30,108 --> 01:12:32,770
Mutha Seth Happy Birthday.

914
01:12:33,945 --> 01:12:40,874
Eeyone gets one sein g.
Fall in line.

915
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,553
Slowly.

916
01:12:43,622 --> 01:12:47,524
ln your hands?
- Give him, give him.

917
01:12:50,095 --> 01:12:53,587
Slow down. Everyone
will get their share.

918
01:12:56,368 --> 01:12:57,335
Mutha Seth Happy Birthday.

919
01:12:57,402 --> 01:12:59,666
Tell them to wish me happy birthday.
- Keep moving.

920
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,465
Mutha Seth Happy Birthday.

921
01:13:04,743 --> 01:13:09,771
By order of the
district administration...

922
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:13,841
to preserve law and order...

923
01:13:14,152 --> 01:13:20,614
a curfew is imposed
between 7 pm and 7 am.

924
01:13:20,959 --> 01:13:25,555
More than 5 people may not
congregate in a public place...

925
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:34,363
with guns, swords,
sticks, spears or knives.

926
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:39,376
Violators will be
prosecuted according to the law.

927
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,804
This curfew begins at
7 pm and ends at 7 am.

928
01:14:15,647 --> 01:14:19,708
Can l leave now?
- There is a night curfew. Stay here.

929
01:14:19,784 --> 01:14:23,515
My mother will worry. She won't sleep.

930
01:14:23,855 --> 01:14:25,948
And l have her medicines.

931
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:29,492
ls she using the medicine
l prescribed?

932
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:30,653
She is coughing lesser.

933
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:31,889
Ok.

934
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:37,467
Be careful. lt's dark outside.

935
01:14:40,538 --> 01:14:44,304
Listen... don't come
to work for a few days.

936
01:14:44,676 --> 01:14:48,043
Take care of your mother.
- Thank you.

937
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:28,447
Professor save me!
Professor, open the door!

938
01:16:05,757 --> 01:16:08,885
We have got Kishan's corpse!

939
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,523
We have got Kishan's corpse!

940
01:16:23,975 --> 01:16:27,069
Sheer injustice! No one is standing
up for Muslims in this country.

941
01:16:27,378 --> 01:16:29,869
l had warned you !
But no one listened.

942
01:16:29,948 --> 01:16:32,940
- Badshah, we elders are
thinking about it.

943
01:16:33,017 --> 01:16:37,420
What has your thinking got us?
lt has only ruined Muslims.

944
01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:39,654
Quiet, now.
- l won't take this lying down.

945
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:42,591
Listen...
- Why should we accept this?

946
01:16:43,027 --> 01:16:46,019
What were Muslims asking for?
Not homes,

947
01:16:46,498 --> 01:16:50,525
not jobs, not schools,
not money, not alms.

948
01:16:50,835 --> 01:16:54,737
All we wanted was one body.
And what did your police do?

949
01:16:54,806 --> 01:16:57,434
lssued curfew orders.
Confined us to our homes.

950
01:16:57,509 --> 01:17:01,536
lf we go out we are killed.
At home, we can only starve.

951
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:05,049
This is our condition now.
But enough is enough.

952
01:17:06,117 --> 01:17:07,379
From now on, we don't need you...

953
01:17:07,452 --> 01:17:09,886
nor your police, your courts,
your government,

954
01:17:09,954 --> 01:17:12,582
Or that pimp Mutha Seth.

955
01:17:12,957 --> 01:17:14,948
Badshah, you've got
this completely wrong.

956
01:17:32,343 --> 01:17:33,901
Where are you going, Shabbo?

957
01:17:35,446 --> 01:17:36,606
To find Anwar.

958
01:17:38,917 --> 01:17:40,407
Tell me the truth.

959
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,844
Police station.

960
01:17:45,757 --> 01:17:46,655
l'll go along.

961
01:17:47,492 --> 01:17:50,552
No, mother!
You cannot come with me.

962
01:17:50,862 --> 01:17:51,851
Why?

963
01:17:52,664 --> 01:17:53,631
Because...

964
01:17:54,933 --> 01:17:56,628
because of the fatwa
( religious diktat).

965
01:17:56,701 --> 01:17:59,761
Women cannot go out of
the house without the veil.

966
01:18:02,974 --> 01:18:06,603
And this is the only veil
that we have.

967
01:18:08,546 --> 01:18:09,410
All right.

968
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:15,647
Shabbo, don't believe
anything that anyone says.

969
01:18:16,521 --> 01:18:19,285
lf anyone calls, never respond.

970
01:18:19,824 --> 01:18:22,452
You get that?
- Yes, mother.

971
01:19:07,772 --> 01:19:09,603
l am Prashant.

972
01:19:13,945 --> 01:19:17,039
Where were you? l have
been looking for you.

973
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:20,712
l looked everywhere,
but l couldn't find you.

974
01:19:21,019 --> 01:19:22,850
Why have you switched your party?

975
01:19:23,354 --> 01:19:26,323
l'm in disguise. l wanted to
go to your house to find you.

976
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:29,683
l was screaming for you.
Why didn't you stop?

977
01:19:30,595 --> 01:19:35,430
l am terrified when my name is called.

978
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:40,636
Terrified of me?
- Yes, l am afraid of everyone...

979
01:19:40,972 --> 01:19:43,463
And particularly of
anyone who is close to me.

980
01:19:43,841 --> 01:19:45,934
You must hate me...?
- Why?

981
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:49,277
Because they burnt your shop.

982
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:54,478
Not only my shop. Even
your moon was burnt.

983
01:19:56,521 --> 01:19:59,547
l should go away.
- Where will you go?

984
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:01,849
To the police station.
To look for Anwar.

985
01:20:01,926 --> 01:20:05,692
Tell me the truth. You came
looking for me, didn't you?

986
01:20:24,148 --> 01:20:26,446
Anwar... come with us.

987
01:20:51,142 --> 01:20:53,042
What is this Shabbo?
- What happened?

988
01:20:53,344 --> 01:20:54,971
Why don't you smile?

989
01:20:56,381 --> 01:20:57,712
Can you smile

990
01:20:57,782 --> 01:20:59,443
Smile.

991
01:22:01,746 --> 01:22:04,044
The victory march is on.

992
01:22:04,415 --> 01:22:07,077
Everything has been finalized.
Even routes.

993
01:22:07,452 --> 01:22:09,920
Nothing can be changed now.

994
01:22:10,955 --> 01:22:12,422
That horse-cart wallah...

995
01:22:13,391 --> 01:22:15,018
Don't call him a horse cart wallah...

996
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,494
Sorry, Hamid...
- Kishan.

997
01:22:18,162 --> 01:22:19,459
Kishan...
- Yes, go on.

998
01:22:19,764 --> 01:22:21,959
Kishan's home.
- Excuse me.

999
01:22:22,433 --> 01:22:25,368
Please read the court's judgment.

1000
01:22:25,703 --> 01:22:32,632
lf you call Kishan by the name of
Hamid, it may be a contempt of court.

1001
01:22:35,513 --> 01:22:37,743
This funeral procession...

1002
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:41,609
Not a funeral procession.
Victory march.

1003
01:22:41,953 --> 01:22:46,652
e begin tle ictoy macl
om ou paty's leaquates.

1004
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:49,927
e ill go to tle maketplace
an  tlen toas tle mosque.

1005
01:22:49,994 --> 01:22:53,896
And then through the Muslim locality
on our way to the crematorium.

1006
01:22:54,866 --> 01:22:59,826
Why through the Muslim locality?
- lt's part of lndia, isn't it?

1007
01:23:00,805 --> 01:23:04,297
Why this roundabout route?

1008
01:23:05,977 --> 01:23:09,378
To enter Muslim areas do
we need separate passports?

1009
01:23:10,114 --> 01:23:12,412
Look...
- Sir...

1010
01:23:13,484 --> 01:23:15,315
This is the tradition.

1011
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,679
Every funeral goes
through the Muslim areas.

1012
01:23:18,356 --> 01:23:20,085
No problem about giving permission.

1013
01:23:22,126 --> 01:23:26,028
lf you follow a straight route...
- l did not come seeking permission.

1014
01:23:28,599 --> 01:23:30,658
l came to invite you.

1015
01:23:32,403 --> 01:23:34,803
To be a part of the victory march.

1016
01:23:34,872 --> 01:23:36,533
Do join us.

1017
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:41,977
A small advice on my way out.

1018
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:47,817
Do not try to stop this victory march.

1019
01:23:51,789 --> 01:23:53,313
Namaskar ( Greetings )

1020
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:05,666
This place is used to riots.

1021
01:24:06,504 --> 01:24:08,870
Once every year or two,
there's always a riot.

1022
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:14,605
The riots begin, people
get into murderous fights.

1023
01:24:14,679 --> 01:24:17,671
They torch each other's homes,
they plunder one another.

1024
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:22,785
They vent their anger.

1025
01:24:23,821 --> 01:24:26,016
After a day or two, all calms down.

1026
01:24:27,024 --> 01:24:29,288
The police should not interfere.

1027
01:24:30,528 --> 01:24:32,587
You will be in charge
of the victory march.

1028
01:24:33,764 --> 01:24:35,823
l am taking a medical test tomorrow.

1029
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,627
Push it after the march.
Then take a day off.

1030
01:24:40,338 --> 01:24:42,602
Get cracking.
- Yes, sir.

1031
01:24:55,786 --> 01:24:56,548
Shoot.

1032
01:24:58,122 --> 01:24:59,680
Shoot properly.

1033
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,290
Fie... again.

1034
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,060
Fie...

1035
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:06,594
Again !

1036
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:14,667
l am so afraid. Are
you not afraid, mother?

1037
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:22,802
No, why fear riots?

1038
01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:29,449
As for me,
l've gotten used to violence.

1039
01:25:30,888 --> 01:25:34,619
eas ago, na's
atle ie in police iin g.

1040
01:25:35,726 --> 01:25:39,457
Now, this circus about your father.

1041
01:25:40,898 --> 01:25:44,800
ln his death, your father
has set this place on fire.

1042
01:25:46,037 --> 01:25:48,597
l had much hopes on Anwar.

1043
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:52,867
Those hopes are also dashed.

1044
01:25:57,348 --> 01:26:02,047
Now... for the next riots, l
have no one to offer as sacrifice.

1045
01:26:03,654 --> 01:26:05,747
What have l got to lose?

1046
01:26:07,058 --> 01:26:09,822
Where is Anwar gone?

1047
01:26:12,129 --> 01:26:18,693
Allah knows. All l know is,
he will never return.

1048
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:28,001
Mother, this might make you angry.
But l must ask you...

1049
01:26:29,013 --> 01:26:32,312
Can l ask?
- Yes.

1050
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:41,219
Prashant and l were going to elope.

1051
01:26:45,863 --> 01:26:50,596
We'd go to Bombay and
start a family, together.

1052
01:26:52,436 --> 01:26:54,563
So many dreams.

1053
01:26:58,542 --> 01:27:03,536
l lie down but cannot sleep.

1054
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:08,045
Cannot eam.

1055
01:27:13,557 --> 01:27:19,587
Would you have said yes?
- To what?

1056
01:27:20,531 --> 01:27:22,761
Marrying Prashant.

1057
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:27,932
No.

1058
01:27:28,672 --> 01:27:29,502
Why?

1059
01:27:31,842 --> 01:27:33,207
He was Hindu.

1060
01:27:36,747 --> 01:27:38,772
What if l had run away?

1061
01:27:41,919 --> 01:27:43,682
Then, l would not have stopped you.

1062
01:27:44,555 --> 01:27:48,616
Really? You would have accepted us?

1063
01:27:50,094 --> 01:27:52,324
Our marriage?

1064
01:28:14,685 --> 01:28:18,849
Not today. Papa is tired.

1065
01:28:19,356 --> 01:28:21,347
l'll tell you a story tomorrow.
Promise.

1066
01:28:21,425 --> 01:28:24,917
l promise you, a long story...

1067
01:28:25,429 --> 01:28:28,455
that won't end until
you are in deep sleep.

1068
01:28:29,633 --> 01:28:31,362
l'll tell you a story about
this place.

1069
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:36,228
There is a sea here.
The sea is full of fish.

1070
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:43,469
And crocodiles and mermaids.
What else? There's a fair.

1071
01:28:43,948 --> 01:28:46,917
People flock from afar
to the fair, for fun.

1072
01:28:47,384 --> 01:28:51,013
n  tley take lome olls,
o tlei augltes.

1073
01:28:51,489 --> 01:28:55,949
couse, l'll buy you a oll.
Fo you, a special sin gin g oll.

1074
01:28:56,427 --> 01:28:58,861
l'll talk to you later.

1075
01:28:58,929 --> 01:29:00,692
Ok. Bye.

1076
01:29:02,566 --> 01:29:05,865
Why did you take this trouble?
You could've summoned me.

1077
01:29:06,504 --> 01:29:07,664
What have you done?

1078
01:29:08,873 --> 01:29:11,398
What have l done?
- You gave the body to the Hindus?

1079
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:15,941
And you gave
permission for a funeral march?

1080
01:29:17,081 --> 01:29:21,518
When the march begins tomorrow,
what will happen?

1081
01:29:22,586 --> 01:29:23,348
What?

1082
01:29:23,954 --> 01:29:28,448
People will get killed. Homes will
be torched. lt'll be a disaster.

1083
01:29:29,894 --> 01:29:31,521
And who will be responsible?

1084
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:34,058
You.

1085
01:29:35,466 --> 01:29:40,904
What can l do? The court
has sided with the Hindus.

1086
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,931
l have read the order.

1087
01:29:46,477 --> 01:29:51,540
The court says, give Kishan's
body to his brother Lakshman.

1088
01:29:52,783 --> 01:29:56,776
Same thing.
- Not the same.

1089
01:29:57,555 --> 01:30:01,958
akslman belon gs to a
ieent sect, a lo caste.

1090
01:30:02,726 --> 01:30:05,889
Their tradition is unique.

1091
01:30:07,031 --> 01:30:09,465
His brother Lakshman
should get the body.

1092
01:30:10,568 --> 01:30:13,332
Where is this brother Lakshman?
- Where indeed?

1093
01:30:14,705 --> 01:30:17,765
He has been threatened into silence.

1094
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:22,411
l am pleading Lakshman's case.

1095
01:30:23,647 --> 01:30:26,673
lt is too late now. l
have solved the problem.

1096
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:32,488
You solved nothing... you
only complicated the problem.

1097
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:38,289
When this news spreads...

1098
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:44,925
thousands will be maimed and killed.

1099
01:30:46,937 --> 01:30:54,469
l am filing a petition
against you, for contempt of court.

1100
01:30:55,713 --> 01:31:00,082
Very well, sir. Do whatever
you wish. This is just too much !

1101
01:31:00,918 --> 01:31:04,081
l respect you. Therefore, good night.

1102
01:31:04,855 --> 01:31:05,913
Please, good night.

1103
01:31:12,963 --> 01:31:17,457
As long as Sun and Moon rise,
Kishan's name will shine.

1104
01:31:26,944 --> 01:31:32,314
l worship The Sun, Giver of Light.

1105
01:31:32,383 --> 01:31:36,843
O'Sun, dispel the darkness in
our hearts.

1106
01:31:47,765 --> 01:31:49,630
What happened?
- You are being arrested.

1107
01:31:49,967 --> 01:31:54,961
You are arresting me? They
maimed us, they burnt our homes.

1108
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:57,735
Those satans are destroying
everything. And you are after me?

1109
01:31:57,808 --> 01:32:01,335
Say that in court.
- You should arrest that Satan.

1110
01:32:01,612 --> 01:32:05,343
We'll talk later.
- This is injustice!

1111
01:32:19,496 --> 01:32:23,694
Mr Bavdekar.... you should
keep on praying all night.

1112
01:32:23,967 --> 01:32:27,528
The people out there are
waiting for me.

1113
01:32:27,838 --> 01:32:30,932
l have an order to arrest you.
l prefer compromise.

1114
01:32:32,109 --> 01:32:36,375
Don't even try to touch me. The
whole town will be set on fire.

1115
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:41,845
And rivers of blood will flow. Not
one of those Muslims will be spared.

1116
01:32:45,589 --> 01:32:47,784
You are under arrest.

1117
01:32:51,695 --> 01:32:52,719
Pick him up.

1118
01:32:55,632 --> 01:33:01,798
O' Moon, Giver of Ocean Tides,
shine in dark, bring to us Peace.

1119
01:33:54,758 --> 01:33:59,559
Aren't you supervising
the deployment today?

1120
01:34:00,464 --> 01:34:04,525
l wish that you wouldn't
step out of home today.

1121
01:34:05,602 --> 01:34:08,867
Are you arresting me?
ls this a house arrest?

1122
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:11,901
Commendable courage.

1123
01:34:12,609 --> 01:34:15,806
But the fire is elsewhere.
How can you douse it here?

1124
01:34:16,613 --> 01:34:20,071
l'm following the rules.
- The rules?

1125
01:34:20,517 --> 01:34:27,753
You got this job because you are a
low caste. Are you teaching me rules?

1126
01:34:28,158 --> 01:34:31,321
l'll call the home minister and tell
him to throw the rule-book at you.

1127
01:34:31,795 --> 01:34:34,787
He will explain, over the phone.
- Are you threatening me?

1128
01:34:35,432 --> 01:34:39,493
Who do you think you are talking to?
l can finish you in one minute!

1129
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:43,339
When l transfer you out of
here and throw you in a jungle...

1130
01:34:43,407 --> 01:34:46,808
you will forget what rules are.
You will rot all your life.

1131
01:34:48,111 --> 01:34:50,636
Pass the phone.
- That won't be useful.

1132
01:34:52,449 --> 01:34:54,815
All phones lines will
stay down for tonight.

1133
01:34:55,319 --> 01:34:58,482
Tomorrow, you may call the home
minister, or chief minister or...

1134
01:35:01,024 --> 01:35:04,983
As for today, don't even
think about stepping outside.

1135
01:35:11,335 --> 01:35:12,461
Take that!

1136
01:35:58,548 --> 01:36:01,949
Stop. Listen carefully.

1137
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:04,812
According to the court's order...

1138
01:36:04,888 --> 01:36:08,517
Kishan's body will be handed
over to his brother Lakshman.

1139
01:36:08,859 --> 01:36:13,819
akslman is itl us.
H e ill get tle boy.

1140
01:36:14,531 --> 01:36:19,798
As for as your funeral march,
it ends here and now.

1141
01:36:20,137 --> 01:36:24,904
l request you to disperse.

1142
01:36:25,676 --> 01:36:30,409
Shoot at sight orders will
be issued after 2 hours.

1143
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,779
This order stays in force
until tonight.

1144
01:36:34,518 --> 01:36:35,576
Thank you.

1145
01:36:37,387 --> 01:36:41,949
Take the hearse backwards.

1146
01:36:42,993 --> 01:36:49,228
As long as the Sun and Moon rise,
Kishan's name will shine.

1147
01:37:27,437 --> 01:37:30,235
What are they doing?
- Burying the dead.

1148
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:32,872
Why are they burying?

1149
01:37:32,943 --> 01:37:36,845
That is the custom in this sect.
They do not cremate.

1150
01:37:37,748 --> 01:37:39,682
But the Muslims were burying him.

1151
01:37:40,083 --> 01:37:43,746
lf ultimately he was to be buried,
why this huge furore?

1152
01:37:44,454 --> 01:37:47,890
Have you read my new book?
- lt was banned immediately.

1153
01:37:48,392 --> 01:37:55,821
And they burnt all the copies.
l saved one copy. lt's for you.

1154
01:37:56,933 --> 01:38:00,596
You might find an
answer after reading it.

1155
01:38:00,937 --> 01:38:02,666
Come on.

1156
01:38:47,884 --> 01:38:56,519
A Blood Donation Camp is being held at
the Police Grounds from 7 am to 6 pm.

1157
01:39:00,964 --> 01:39:02,022
Sir...

1158
01:39:03,366 --> 01:39:05,493
Something's gone awfully wrong.
- Now what?

1159
01:39:05,902 --> 01:39:08,462
The name of this place is Canda.
- So...?

1160
01:39:09,306 --> 01:39:12,241
You came to Canda by mistake.
- What does that mean?

1161
01:39:12,576 --> 01:39:17,843
Actually, you were transferred to
Banda. But the typist made an error...

1162
01:39:17,914 --> 01:39:20,849
... about A-B-C-D.
That's how you came to Canda.

1163
01:39:22,119 --> 01:39:25,748
Who told you?
- Headquarters called.

1164
01:39:26,089 --> 01:39:28,023
Your new transfer letter is ready.

1165
01:39:28,658 --> 01:39:30,922
Have l been in the
wrong place for 1 0 days?

1166
01:39:31,461 --> 01:39:32,450
Don't mind this, Sir.

1167
01:39:32,829 --> 01:39:36,287
lf you had taken God's blessings,
these problems wouldn't have arisen.

1168
01:39:36,967 --> 01:39:40,300
Excuse me, l must go
to receive the new boss.

1169
01:39:44,107 --> 01:39:48,840
Before starting the new job, you
must do Hindu rituals. Please!

1170
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:02,051
elcome Raiq. sSalaamu llaikum.

1171
01:40:02,459 --> 01:40:04,427
One tea for Rafiq. Sit.

1172
01:40:05,128 --> 01:40:09,690
What've you thought? Are you
migrating to the Muslim neighbourhood?

1173
01:40:09,966 --> 01:40:13,458
Quickly, you'll run out of choices.
- Decided, l'm moving in.

1174
01:40:13,803 --> 01:40:18,900
Good. l've spoken with Mr. Resul.
He is migrating to Saudi Arabia.

1175
01:40:19,442 --> 01:40:22,502
Nice house, behind the mosque.
You can hear the muezzin's call.

1176
01:40:22,846 --> 01:40:25,406
What more could you want?

1177
01:40:26,783 --> 01:40:28,751
Your tea is getting cold.

1178
01:40:32,689 --> 01:40:34,316
Badshah, our beloved Badshah.

1179
01:40:34,391 --> 01:40:36,985
Brother to all in need,
a friend indeed.

1180
01:40:37,594 --> 01:40:38,322
Sir...

1181
01:40:38,762 --> 01:40:39,729
Sir...

1182
01:40:41,398 --> 01:40:42,422
Yes, Naik?

1183
01:40:42,499 --> 01:40:45,024
Blackie has escaped from this town.

1184
01:40:45,468 --> 01:40:48,631

- Foeign

1185
01:40:49,072 --> 01:40:51,563
l am also escaping from this town.
- Why, what happened?

1186
01:40:51,641 --> 01:40:52,437
Long story.

1187
