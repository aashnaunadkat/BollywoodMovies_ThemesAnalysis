00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,881
Hello and welcome to the TC Show.

2
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,722
No, we are not talking
about Railway TC's here.

3
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,991
This is 'TC', Tele-Shopping Channel.

4
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,032
I would like to show an AV..

5
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,192
..to our heavy audience.

6
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,702
And don't mistake
him for anyone ordinary.

7
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,035
..he's quite a heavy personality.

8
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:19,601
Our very own Mumbai
boy Akhil Lokhande.

9
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,243
I am quite distressed.

10
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,247
I always wanted to
excel in every field.

11
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,817
Thats why these days..

12
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:35,019
...I'm living my life in
4 XL, 5 XL, 6 XL sizes.

13
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,122
I always wanted to do
work equal of six people.

14
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,289
Now when I enter any lift..

15
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,865
...I realize I am
equivalent to six people.

16
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,871
I always thought life could
never tread on a single wheel.

17
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,299
When there is a will,
there is no way.

18
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,704
I always thought how
will I pacify my kid.

19
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,080
I am really disturbed.

20
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,855
Friends, this depressing
AV was shot two months ago.

21
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,693
Well, let's wel	come..

22
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,998
Farhad, Sajid, is the stage firm?

23
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,557
Yes, absolutely.

24
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,264
Please welcome Akhil Lokhande.

25
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,759
Akhil Lokhande. Wow!

26
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,230
You showed up alone.

27
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,534
I don't see the rest
of Akhil Lokhande's anywhere.

28
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,767
Sir, now no more “I'm disturbed“.

29
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,103
But I am surprised.

30
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,734
How did this happen?

31
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,073
Hold on.

32
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,810
<i>JC!</i>

33
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,075
Jagtap Capsules!

34
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,043
A unique invention
made of Ayurvedic herbs.

35
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,246
A bottle of JC...and you're all set.

36
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,650
JC means...
- Jagtap Capsules.

37
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:15,723
Come on.

38
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,159
Turn this Laurel into Hardy.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,854
And he should look
like Akhil Lokhande.

40
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,522
Sir..
- Stick it properly.

41
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,997
You're not concentrating.
- Sir.

42
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,195
The deal was 4000,
this is just 2500.

43
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,797
So, you didn't put on
any weight for it either.

44
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,633
Keep this, a bottle of JC.

45
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,607
Go and build 16 abs.

46
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,734
World record.
Be happy.

47
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,114
You've got your head in the air.

48
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,205
I will kill you.

49
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,182
Why? Are you a villain?

50
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,583
Villain?

51
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,981
Don't create a scene here.
- Why, are you a jester?

52
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:45,984
Jester.

53
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,185
Don't test me, my hands are not tied.
- Why? Are you a widow?

54
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,117
Widow?

55
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,526
Why you..

56
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,063
Phone's ringing.

57
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,258
Hold him.

58
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,158
Hello.

59
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,200
Yes, I am coming.

60
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,792
I said I am coming.

61
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,531
If I wasn't in such a hurry..

62
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,071
...I would've exacted my money.

63
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,166
Get lost. - It's important,
or I wouldn't have spared you.

64
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,769
He pretends as if the entire
world dances to his tune.

65
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,658
One more.

66
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,784
Five, six, seven, eight.

67
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,487
Stop it. Stop it.

68
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,961
Stop the rehearsals.

69
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:26,997
Music cut. Music cut.

70
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,033
Remove all the male dancers..

71
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,931
..keep the female dancers.

72
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,970
Boys, pack-up.

73
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:33,833
Girls, come in the front.

74
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,668
What do you mean by
"Girls come in the front" Remo sir?

75
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,969
You think you can throw
us out whenever you like?

76
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,170
I know, I'll break your teeth?

77
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,678
Why, are you a dentist?

78
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,711
Dentist?

79
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,849
I'll crush you.
- Why, are you tobacco?

80
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,082
Tobacco?

81
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,676
I'll will gut you.
- Why, are you Hajmola?

82
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,684
Hajmola, why you..

83
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,751
Let go.
Let me go.

84
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,718
Hold him.

85
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,089
Hello? Coming.

86
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,528
Let me go.
- Ifl didn't have to leave urgently.

87
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,096
...I would've exacted my money.
Understand.

88
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:01,996
Get lost.

89
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,501
It's important
or I wouldn't have spared you.

90
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,695
Let go.

91
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:07,928
Let go.
Important?

92
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,041
He pretends as
if he'll build a big empire.

93
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,855
Lord...

94
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:25,946
So Borivali team has set a target.

95
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,583
..of 120 runs for Dombiva
i's team.

96
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,525
And Dombivali team's opening batsman.

97
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,529
..has arrived on the crease.

98
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,861
One.. Two.

99
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,972
Howzat!

100
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,173
What?

101
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,073
Where did you get him from?

102
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,635
It touched my bat.

103
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,146
He'll even give a cripple LBW out.

104
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,841
Now go.
- Sir, it hit the bat.

105
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,817
Be quiet,
or I'll give you out as well.

106
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,518
Howzat!

107
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,650
Howzat!

108
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,558
Howzat!

109
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,893
Howzat!

110
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,728
Howzat!

111
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,001
Howzat!

112
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,600
Howzat!

113
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,810
Here's your money.

114
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,012
Akhil, you really
stirred up things today.

115
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:29,917
Really!

116
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,216
What can I do?
I have to get to my other job..

117
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,717
But this is not done.

118
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,587
Your days of raising
fingers are over, boy.

119
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,651
Now I will lift my hand.
- Why? Are you a beggar?

120
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,919
I will send you back on a stretcher?

121
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,556
Why? Are you a compounder?

122
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,797
I am going to malign you.

123
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,767
Why? Are you a rag-picker?
— Rag..

124
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,929
Let's take care of him!

125
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,563
Now say. Come on.

126
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,833
Here. Keep one note.

127
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,642
Hey...
- Hey!

128
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,237
Don't hit.
- Let's go.

129
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,678
Now get to your other job.

130
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,514
Other work.

131
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,143
Feels like you've married to
your work, not me.

132
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,720
Each day I would kindle my desires..

133
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,990
..on the threshold of hopes.

134
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,927
And today's ‘Kanrvachauth’.

135
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,930
The biggest day in your wife's life.

136
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,462
Most important.

137
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,060
And you came late even today.

138
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,763
Why?

139
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,730
You made me your wife.

140
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,234
So why did you do this with me?

141
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,204
Why?

142
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,037
Parvati , actually...

143
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,881
...work is just an excuse.

144
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,083
There's someone else in my life.

145
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,180
Kavyanjali.

146
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,549
Dear, please try to..
- Enough!

147
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,856
Enough! Enough!

148
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,793
“Virtuous bonds“,
Made for Each Other“..

149
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,956
...all these are just
too good to be true.

150
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,728
But the truth is...
I am just your discard.

151
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,532
All I wanted was one smile of joy“.

152
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,696
..in my own beautiful world of dreams.

153
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,671
But you've proved..

154
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,040
..our union is no Iongerjustified.

155
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,909
Cut it. Very good shot.

156
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,778
Bunch of freeloaders.

157
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,248
Hi.

158
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,823
Our date was fixed before my shoot.

159
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,759
And I am sorry.

160
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,702
What are you doing?

161
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,942
Well, I feel like taking
you to an expensive place today.

162
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:32,999
Where?

163
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,636
Petrol Station.

164
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,702
Because there's nothing
more expensive than that.

165
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,573
Uncle, ball.

166
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:40,743
Thank you.

167
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,049
You know,
my life's like this football.

168
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,852
Whoever comes,
kicks me and gets ahead.

169
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,659
You'll achieve your goal
through these kicks, Akhil.

170
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,924
And I know what your goal is.

171
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,166
To help your father get better.

172
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,100
Poor guy's been in
the hospital for a year.

173
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,998
You work day and night
to cover his expenses.

174
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,676
But just watch.

175
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,139
Someday he'll be absolutely fine.

176
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,213
Really?

177
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,616
I swear.

178
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,187
Thanks.

179
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,153
Hey.

180
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,917
Forget it. Thief.

181
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,254
Are you hitting on me?

182
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,154
Do I look like a ruler to hit on you.

183
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,162
Will you stick to me?
- Do I look like Fevicol to stick to you?

184
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,832
Kiss me?
- Am I Emraan Hashmi to kiss you?

185
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,556
"Someone dwells in me all day."

186
00:11:53,913 --> 00:12:00,159
"My days and nights are lost in her."

187
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,592
“Someone feels so close.“

188
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:13,002
"As if my head beats in him."

189
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:19,274
"There's no cure to...
what I've been struck with."

190
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,141
"Someone touched my head."

191
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,212
"Whose sights do I owe it to?"

192
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,885
"
f anyone asks, I'll say it's you."

193
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,721
"
f anyone asks, I'll say it's you."

194
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,265
“I'll tell everyone
that it's your effect.“

195
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,875
"
f anyone asks, I'll say it's you."

196
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,711
"
f anyone asks, I'll say it's you."

197
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,867
"Someone knocks on my heart."

198
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:21,037
"..comes in and stays there."

199
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:28,514
"What's this sin that has no atone?"

200
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,587
"Someone touched my head."

201
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,591
"Whose prayers do I owe it to?"

202
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,652
"
f anyone asks, I'll say it's you."

203
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:45,295
"
f anyone asks, I'll say it's you."

204
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:05,250
"Wrapped in satin clothes."

205
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:10,256
"Filled with abundant of colors."

206
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:16,263
"What's this gift I've been
bestowed with?"

207
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:23,269
"What's this gift I've been
bestowed with?"

208
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:30,810
“Don't let it slip through your lips.“

209
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:36,509
“Don't let it slip through your lips.“

210
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:43,623
"My patience's melting for you."

211
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,960
"
f anyone asks, I'll say it's you."

212
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,935
"
f anyone asks, I'll say it's you."

213
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,196
So...what do you want to say?

214
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,806
Have you planned for
a candle light Dinner?

215
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,936
Papa's trying to save electricity.

216
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,101
Quiet.

217
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,910
For your kind information.

218
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,878
I like my conversation.

219
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,144
..in the isolation of darkness.

220
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,548
Miser!

221
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,080
What happened?

222
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,219
There's no arm-rest on this side.

223
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,784
You get only half the
sofa in half the amount.

224
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:52,993
Hey!

225
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,827
What are you doing?

226
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,026
Papa, let me switch on one light.

227
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,196
Sir, I'm here to ask for
your daughter's hand for marriage.

228
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,170
And do you have
irritation or objection..

229
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,867
..with the rest of her body?

230
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,838
Meaning?

231
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,933
I mean..

232
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,544
..your relation with my
daughter is out of question.

233
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,645
Cancellation, rejection!

234
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,514
Why, sir?
What lacks in me?

235
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:18,248
You've something even
the rich can't have. - What?

236
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,580
Poverty.

237
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,984
You're poor.
- Sir, your..

238
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,850
You're a hapless.

239
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,028
There's no strength
in this relationship.

240
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,154
Papa!

241
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,091
Your daughter's necessities are few..

242
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,194
..that's why this
relationship is the best.

243
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,661
What do I want?

244
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,941
Three cotton clothes,
two pieces of bread..

245
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,039
...and a single courtyard.

246
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,078
I don't want a palace of sorrows..

247
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,104
..just a hut filled with joy.

248
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,045
Get lost.

249
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,980
Stop reciting your TV serial dialogues.

250
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,584
Hey...
What's your name?

251
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,950
Yeah Akhil Lokhande.

252
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,513
Lokhande!

253
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,549
Listen carefully.

254
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,988
I want a husband for my daughter...

255
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:03,056
..who's wealthy, and not the person
who wants sympathy.

256
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,590
Wealthy.

257
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,598
Now do you understand?

258
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,202
Come back when you're rich.

259
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,232
Out!

260
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,474
Out!

261
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,633
What if I don't go?

262
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,043
I'll kick you?
- Why, are you a donkey?

263
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,709
I'll break your milk-teeth?
- Why, are you the milkman?

264
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,718
I'll bash you so hard.
- Why, are you a maid?

265
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,812
He's so audacious.

266
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,558
Fine, if you like
being such a loud-mouth..

267
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,988
..then...swear on this fire..

268
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,961
You won't decide
to marry my daughter..

269
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,264
..until you become a millionaire.

270
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,503
Come on, swear.

271
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,129
Akhil..
- Don't say anything.

272
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,872
I swear.

273
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,104
First millionaire,
then Sakshi's husband.

274
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,040
Papa's trying to trap you.

275
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,878
You are trapped.

276
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,774
Laugh all you want, sir.

277
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,720
But listen to my
mathematics carefully.

278
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,548
I am going to multiply money..

279
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:07,225
..and soon it will subtract
the smile on your face.

280
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,632
Your mind will get divided..

281
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:13,966
..and your daughter
will get added in my life.

282
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,871
Are you a mathematics teacher?

283
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,534
Addition.

284
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,236
Papa, electricity's back.

285
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,844
I am ruined.

286
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,779
Who's going to pay the bill?

287
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,078
I am ruined.

288
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,245
I am ruined.

289
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,953
I will kill you.

290
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,818
Who will pay my bills?

291
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,555
O Bollywood...who do I pray..

292
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,855
..so that business is never slow..

293
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,162
..and my shop makes me popular.

294
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,500
Jugnu, give me 'Honeymoon Dvd“.

295
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,070
Son, first take ‘Dosti’,
then ‘Mohabbatein’.

296
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,739
Then 'Shaadi No.1'
and then 'Honeymoon'.

297
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,972
And then..

298
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,240
That's 400 for 4 CDs.

299
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,810
Get out.

300
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,111
What do you want?
- 'Darr'.

301
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,116
Only 'Darr'.
- Yes.

302
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,675
Take Jeet as well.
- Why?

303
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,584
Because beyond 'Darr'
there's ‘Jeet’ (Victory).

304
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,950
Show off..

305
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,981
Akhil.

306
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,116
Akhil.

307
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,521
My friend,
where are you going in such a humble way?

308
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,223
On my way to the hospital.

309
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,728
And after that to work.

310
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,598
I must admit, buddy.

311
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,636
Hold on.

312
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
Look, this is 'Baghbaan'.

313
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,538
Four sons couldn't look
after their only father.

314
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,735
And you alone do four
jobs a day for your father.

315
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,242
That's not a big thing.

316
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,073
I'm sweating for my own blood.

317
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,913
That's called love.

318
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,121
You've always fulfilled
every desire of your father.

319
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,986
I'll come with you
to the hospital now.

320
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,752
And how would uncle be living“.

321
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,188
..in the hospital all these clays?

322
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,496
“Don't try to stop me.“

323
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,571
“Don't object if I follow you.“

324
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,212
“Don't try to stop me.“

325
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,516
“Don't object if I follow you.“

326
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,588
“I've a right on you.
You're my delight.“

327
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,559
"Don't be shocked if
I obstruct your way."

328
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,562
"You're right beside me.
I am right next to you."

329
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,295
"You're right beside me.
I am right next to you."

330
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,232
"You're right beside me.
I am right next to you."

331
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,867
"You're right beside me.
I am right next to you."

332
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,807
Akhil?

333
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,743
Oh, God. I am exhausted.

334
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,241
Don't you have chest-pain anymore?

335
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,285
What chest-pain?

336
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,814
It's just another excuse.

337
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,984
..to spend another year
in this luxurious hospital.

338
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:55,128
And to get acquainted
to nurses like you.

339
00:20:55,787 --> 00:21:00,896
But...is it a good thing
to squander your son's money?

340
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,166
It's bad. It's very bad.

341
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,497
But he's not my son.

342
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,668
He's my ticket to comfort and luxury.

343
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,206
He's my walking ATM counter for me.

344
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,779
Who's this?

345
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,085
Where are you going?

346
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,250
Son, you've arrived.

347
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,122
Am I a fax, to arrive?

348
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,225
Look, you're turning red.

349
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,929
Am I a traffic light to turn red?

350
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,768
Look, son, you're over-doing it.

351
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,602
Am I a bowler to do an over?

352
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:48,043
I treated you like God.

353
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,050
Tell me who my father is.

354
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,183
I've no clue.

355
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,626
But 30 years ago..

356
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,757
...I met your mother
during a rail journey.

357
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,798
You were just a 3-4 years old kid.

358
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,768
You were playing
in your mother's arms.

359
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,267
And during our conversation.

360
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,135
“Your mother narrated
her sad story to me.

361
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,240
How your father made
your mother pregnant.

362
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,809
..but not his wife, because..

363
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,146
..there was another
mistress in his life.

364
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,979
When your mother heard this..

365
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,146
..she left your conniving father..

366
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,191
..and was returning in that train.

367
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,990
But just then...

368
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,629
...the train met with accident.

369
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,526
And your mother passed away.

370
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,700
But you survived.

371
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:43,262
It's the grace of God, Akhil.
You survived.

372
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,208
If I hadn't survived that day,
would I be..

373
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,176
I've yet to get to the point.

374
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,837
The interesting pan comes now.

375
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,173
The Rail Minister arrived
at the accident spot.

376
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,842
And he announced that.

377
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,581
..any family with
even on deceased member..

378
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,590
...will get 1 lakh as compensation.

379
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,682
Sol picked up his trunk, and him..

380
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,627
..and pretended as he was my son and..

381
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:12,828
Beat him.
- I am dead!

382
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,892
Beat him.
- Oh, God!

383
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,604
More.

384
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,732
Old man..

385
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,236
You really gave him a sound beating.

386
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,701
Very good.

387
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,610
Old man.

388
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:28,015
As you sow...so shall you reap.

389
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,284
I can't believe this.

390
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,958
Your bachelor father's
shown us such a dirty picture.

391
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:45,097
The question is Akhil,
what is your origin?

392
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,868
Because this is reality.
Real life.

393
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,174
This isn't 'Gol maal' where
you'll find an old trunk..

394
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,269
..in the house like Ajay Devgan did.

395
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,882
Well, let's imagine
that you do find a trunk.

396
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,612
You do.

397
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,691
But it's not necessary
that you'll open it up..

398
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,662
...and just like in Manisha's
film 'Love Letter'..

399
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,492
..it would have your
mother's love letters.

400
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,262
..and you'll find those too.

401
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,595
Well, we're filmy people.
Let's take some Iibeﬂy.

402
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,606
Let's assume that you
found the love letters as well.

403
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:28,005
It's not necessary that
you'll also find a locket.

404
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,206
...like Jeetendra did
in this film 'Locket'.

405
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,617
Since I took Jeetendra's name,
let's take some more liberty.

406
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,209
Even if you find the locket.

407
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,088
You won't find your parent's
photo in the locket.

408
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,789
Even if you find
your father's picture..

409
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,227
..your father won't turn
out to be a millionaire.

410
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,562
Pannalal Johri.

411
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,928
Yes, Pannalal Johri.

412
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,524
Bangkok's diamond king.

413
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,001
He can't be your father.

414
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,831
My father's Pannalal Johri.

415
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,064
What?
- Yes.

416
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,237
What?
- Yes.

417
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,572
Akhil, you're a millionaire.

418
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,246
Jugnu.

419
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,612
I am a millionaire.
- Yes.

420
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,177
Jugnu. I am a millionaire.

421
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,522
What did I just press?
- What's this?

422
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,956
Bangkok's diamond merchant.

423
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,930
...multi-millionaire Pannalal Johri
passed away today.

424
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:27,129
Pannalal Johri was a renowned
personality in Bangkok.

425
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,227
Akhil.

426
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,500
Akhil.

427
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,034
Your father wasn't even born yet..

428
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,235
..and he Died.

429
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,105
You're so unlucky.

430
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,681
You're doomed.

431
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,117
Akhil.

432
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,218
Akhil.

433
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,219
Akhil.

434
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,254
Akhil.

435
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,285
I'll get water for you.

436
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,117
I hope my friend doesn't die.

437
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,890
Akhil.

438
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,226
Akhil, the shock's made you mad.

439
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,969
Jugnu, it's not the shock,
I am mad with joy.

440
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,968
You heard the bad news,
not the complete news.

441
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,476
Listen. Listen.

442
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,036
So what about his property
worth 3000 crores.

443
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,106
Because he has no heir,
or wife and kids.

444
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,980
If any of his relative turns up..

445
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,079
..then he'll be the owner
of 3000 crores overnight.

446
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,557
Now you drink the water.

447
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,024
Some more.

448
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,668
Jugnu, my father's dead..

449
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,968
..and I am not happy about it.

450
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,765
In fact, I am very happy.

451
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:39,908
Why?

452
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,912
Because he betrayed my mother.

453
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,710
That's why Lord took away my father..

454
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,175
...and served me justice.

455
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,551
He gave me all these evidence..

456
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,249
..so that I can prove to the world..

457
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:57,187
..that I am Pannalal Johri's son.

458
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:03,795
Jugnu, now this
Slumdog's a millionaire.

459
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,817
'Johnny Johnny. .
- Yes.“

460
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,683
“Are you drinking?
- NO JI.

461
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,653
"Open your mouth.
- Aww."

462
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,621
“Telling lies.
- No Ji.

463
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,625
'Johnny Johnny. .
- Yes.“

464
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,558
“Have you been drinking?
- No Ji.

465
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,527
“Open your mouth.
- No Ji.

466
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,121
“Telling lies.
- No Ji.

467
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,089
"No, no, no."

468
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,166
“I've not been drinking.“

469
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,931
“I've not been drinking.“

470
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,972
“I've not been drinking.“

471
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,902
“I've been forced to drink.“

472
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,876
“I've been forced to drink.“

473
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,810
"It's all okay."

474
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,280
“I'm having fun.“

475
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,244
"in the bar, in the car."

476
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,076
"She's got thousands of problems."

477
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,984
"She keeps drinking
all the while and says.."

478
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,989
"This is my first."

479
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,854
"In the bar, in the car."

480
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,790
"He sways like he's drunk."

481
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,794
"He keeps drinking
all the while and says.."

482
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,955
“I'll stop drinking at dawn.“

483
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,090
"Never listens to anyone."

484
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,032
"Bad habits all the while."

485
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,967
"On every bottle he says.."

486
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,800
"This is the last one for the day."

487
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,897
"Never listens to anyone."

488
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,908
"Bad habits all the while."

489
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,705

00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,307
WOW, Akhil.

536
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:42,910
From "l am really troubled"
to "l am really rich".

537
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,934
Crazy boy.

538
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,667
He's trying to stop the king..

539
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,940
..from entering his own palace.

540
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:12,646
Papa.

541
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,809
Papa, it's your son..

542
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,854
This is terrible.

543
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,264
I've been orphaned again.

544
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,667
What's this guy blabbering about?

545
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,900
Please.

546
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,537
You look like an Indian.
- I am Habibullah Sheikh.

547
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,764
Pannalal's right-hand.

548
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,900
His lawyer.

549
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,144
Mister, how did this happen?

550
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:47,181
The diamond from Johri sir's
ring fell in his potato wedges.

551
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:52,050
And he swallowed the diamond instead.

552
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,289
<i>And...he died in 2 minutes.</i>

553
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,560
He's not a noodles to die instantly.

554
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,160
Address him with respect.
Do you know who he was?

555
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,555
He was my father.

556
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,592
He's my papa.

557
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,060
My dad.

558
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,608
Now give me the money.

559
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,039
Hanky.

560
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:19,876
What did you hear?

561
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,780
Money.

562
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,749
Corrupt mind!

563
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,720
Papa, you can't speak properly.

564
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,090
This man can't hear properly.

565
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,221
Life without you is no fun.

566
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,064
Because I've turned into an orphan.

567
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:47,032
Your memories are still
in this bungalow, isn't it?

568
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,670
So...now I will live in this bungalow.

569
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,772
..with your memories.

570
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,815
The car you took to the office,
that huge car..

571
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,614
..now I'll drive to the office in it.

572
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:04,527
I'll find your company
while handling your company papa.

573
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:06,918
What is it?

574
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,563
I would like to talk
to you on an important issue.

575
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:13,829
What?
- Talk.

576
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,737
Talk?

577
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,000
Akhil, I don't need to investigate.

578
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,806
I mean question you.

579
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:23,607
What?

580
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,172
Why can't you be Pannalal Johri's son?

581
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,649
Have some tea.

582
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:33,154
Every year,
when India can produce children..

583
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,089
“Equivalent to
population of Australia..

584
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,921
..then why can't
Pannalal sir produce you?

585
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,791
Is that logic enough for you?
- Yes.

586
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,731
He's from Bangkok, I'm from Borivali.
Is that okay?

587
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,531
I've another logic for that.
- Go ahead.

588
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,005
If India's Sania Mirza,
Pakistan's Shoaib Malik..

589
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,874
..can be husband and wife.

590
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,307
Then why can't Bangkok's
Pannalal Johri and..

591
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,106
Hold on. Have you studied LAW?

592
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,046
Yes?

593
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,918
No, because...this concerns 3000 crores,
Lulla sir.

594
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,253
Hey! That's Habibullah.

595
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,050
Look, my father's given me this name..

596
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,118
..with great love and affection.

597
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,961
So please..
- I mean, you're a lawyer.

598
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,796
Won't you ask for any evidence?

599
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:24,534
Like these...love-letters
written by my father.

600
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,767
This locket.

601
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,231
Family album.

602
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,205
But these days any
fraud can forge all this..

603
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,247
..with the help of computer graphics.

604
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,844
So here's my blood.

605
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,084
This will prove that I am his blood.

606
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,247
D.N.A.

607
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,084
'Daddy's Najayaz Aulad'
(Daddy's illegitimate son).

608
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,930
These things aren't needed, son.

609
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,929
I recognized you at first sight.

610
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,560
Your mother's name
was Shanti Devi, right?

611
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:57,267
Yes.

612
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,532
Sometimes,
my boss would feel embarrassed..

613
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,104
..and mention about her to me.

614
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:04,770
Fine.

615
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,012
So tell me,
Habibullah sir, when can I take over.

616
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,811
You can't take over..

617
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,114
..because someone's
already over-taken you.

618
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,519
What do you mean?

619
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,854
Pannalal made a Will before he died.

620
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,253
And he transferred his
entire property to someone else.

621
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,252
Who is it?

622
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,627
Does he have another illegitimate son?

623
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,791
Any son?

624
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,263
More than a son?

625
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,004
This is a conspiracy.

626
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,164
A big game-plan.

627
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,565
Hold on.

628
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,142
Did he show you any proof?

629
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,943
Letter. . .locket. . father's picture.

630
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,547
Did the DNA matched?

631
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,776
Then damn it.

632
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,049
How can he be my father's heir?

633
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,646
How dare he try to assert
his right on my property?

634
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,552
No!

635
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,515
I won't let this happen.

636
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,051
Who's that rascal?

637
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,522
Where's that rascal?

638
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,822
Rascal!

639
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,085
Pannalal Johri's was
cremated only a while ago..

640
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:31,099
..and you've already usurped his seat.

641
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,737
It's about 3000 crores.

642
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,202
Everyone's conscience is for sale.

643
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:46,915
But I am the real heir
of Pannalal Johri, not you.

644
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,985
All this belongs to me.

645
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,984
This property is only mine.

646
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,222
Did you hear?

647
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:56,851
Turn the chair around.

648
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,822
Look at me.

649
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,757
Look into my eyes.

650
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,724
Turn the chair around!

651
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,602
He's Pannalal Johri's heir.

652
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,747
His sweet, adorable and only...

653
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,715
..and more than a son.

654
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,581
But he's a dog.

655
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:27,017
For God's sake, don't call him a dog.
- Why?

656
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,223
Because his name's Entertainment.

657
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,529
Why Entertainment?

658
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,760
Why? Why not?

659
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,201
If pigeons can be called 'Masakali'.

660
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,001
Horse can be called 'Badal' (Cloud).

661
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,042
If Mahila Jaywardhane
can be a male's name.

662
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,741
Then why can't his
name be Entertainment?

663
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,940
Look, Akhil.

664
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,712
Pannalal Johri was really sad..

665
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,253
..after your mother's accident.

666
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,622
He started repenting .

667
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,926
He was living like a live monument.

668
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,692
For years he attempted
to find you two..

669
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,733
..in many continents.

670
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,600
But then he got disappointed.

671
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,065
...and after getting
disconnected from everyone“.

672
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,631
..tried to kill himself
on his pavement.

673
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,101
That's when he...he saved his life.

674
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,008
Hello, sir.

675
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:31,611
Since then he dwelled
in the basement of his heart

676
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,813
He became the 'Pepsodent
of his brush'.

677
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,983
The peppermint in his life.

678
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,687
The instrument of his music.

679
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,025
And his name..
- I know.

680
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,561
Became Entenainment.

681
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:48,670
Now tell me...if Pannalal
hadn't given his property.

682
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:52,038
...to Entertainment,
then who else would he give it to.

683
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:09,547
My millionaire father
gave his property to a dog.

684
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,657
To a dog!

685
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,894
I am ruined.

686
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,662
My father made my
life worse than a dog.

687
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,755
I am ruined.

688
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,593
I am poor again.

689
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,993
Hello.
- Akhil, this is Jugnu speaking.

690
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,696
Shocked to hear my voice, aren't you?

691
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,675
I am in Bangkok.

692
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,301
Jugnu.

693
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,108
A Slumdog DID became the billionaire.

694
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,672
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

695
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,685
Your buddy's been
orphaned again. - No.

696
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,880
I am ruined.
- No.

697
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,322
I've lost the 3000 crores.
- No, this isn't possible.

698
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,787
Akhil. Hello, Akhil.

699
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,964
I really can't believe this again.

700
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,205
A dog's name 'Entertainment'.

701
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,712
The dog's name is shocking for you.

702
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,608
But he usurped my 3000 crore..

703
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,119
..that isn't shocking for you.

704
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,018
<i>Sorry! yaar</i>

705
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,123
That dog.

706
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:27,062
By the way, is he a male or a female?

707
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:31,859
I've an idea.

708
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,102
Take a stone and hurl it at him.

709
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,268
If HE runs, he is male.

710
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,674
Or if SHE runs, she is female.

711
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:44,602
Whether he's a male or a female,
but he stole my bone.

712
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,976
Sorry, sorry.

713
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,074
I can understand what I am asking you.

714
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:53,187
Look, Akhil. Don't be sad.

715
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,717
You please divert
your mind from this dog.

716
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,290
Forget the dog.

717
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,155
Look, I'm sure you haven't
eaten anything since yesterday.

718
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,156
Eat something.

719
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,129
Will you..

720
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,555
Would you like a Hot Dog?

721
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,003
Don't beat me like a dog.

722
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,572
Save me kids.

723
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,876
Jugnu.

724
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,580
What now?

725
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,051
I'll go crazy if I stay here.

726
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,593
Come on, let's go back to India.

727
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,290
Are you crazy, Akhil?

728
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,229
You want to go back to India.

729
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,068
How will you face Saakshi?

730
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,102
Akhil, you are going
to let a dog live your life..

731
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,107
..and live like a dog yourself.

732
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,707
Akhil, you're the hero of this story.

733
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,002
And that dog's the villain.

734
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:54,205
And the hero always kills the villain.

735
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,178
Take the history of
Bollywood for example.

736
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,612
Gabbar, Shaakal, Mogambo.

737
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,756
They all died a dog's death.

738
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,554
And he's already a dog.

739
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,720
Easy job!

740
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,095
He has to die, and like a dog.

741
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,154
Do anything you want.

742
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:13,532
Shoot him, stab him,
slam him on the ground.. - No!

743
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,934
But kill him.
- No! No!

744
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,835
I can't kill anyone.

745
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:21,136
Not just anyone but the
one who's taken your wealth.

746
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,109
The one who has ruined your destiny.

747
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,671
The one who has brought
you on the street.

748
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:30,214
Akhil, I say for your right,
you have to kill the dog.

749
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,980
Akhil, you have to kill the dog.

750
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:35,750
Akhil, for the sake of your right,
just kill the dog.

751
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,290
You should kill the dog.

752
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:38,925
Kill the dog.

753
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,929
Kill that dog.

754
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,791
Kill the dog...Akshay Kumar.

755
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:49,199
You mutt...I'll kill you.

756
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:55,610
Entertainment,
it's time for your exercise.

757
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,911
Come. Climb on.

758
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,847
All the mills in the
world have closed down.

759
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:04,011
There's just one working mill,
that's the Treadmill.

760
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:05,948
Please climb up.

761
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,655
Climb up

762
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,021
This is not a local
train that he'll climb up.

763
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:11,788
Hello, Akhil.
- Hello.

764
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,019
Hello.

765
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,488
Bone from underpants.

766
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,158
I'll help you.

767
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,011
Wonderful.
You were really amazing.

768
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,049
So please make me
Entertainment's caretaker.

769
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,174
I see.

770
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:38,516
He served papa till his last breath.
- Yes.

771
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:43,180
And in return,
I'll serve him till his last.

772
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:43,918
Please.

773
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,858
Please. Please, sir.

774
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,226
Please don't say, Zardullah.
- Hey.

775
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,662
That's Habibullah!

776
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:50,957
Are you crazy?

777
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,625
Habibullah! Habibullah!

778
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,794
<i>Sorry!</i>

779
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,001
Fine.

780
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,762
From now on you will
always look after him. - Yes.

781
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:00,138
Habibullah!
- Yes.

782
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,141
Habibullah!

783
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:08,107
Let the war begin.

784
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,751
When the dog comes and holds this,
he will..

785
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,188
...he'll get electrocuted and he'll die.

786
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,959
Come on.

787
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,700
Come on, everything's in place.
- Come on.

788
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,209
Switch it on.

789
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:39,640
The dog's coming.

790
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,681
Hurry up. HUT"! UP-

791
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,012
Let's get out of here.

792
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,553
He's here.

793
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,101
The dog didn't get electrocuted?

794
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,013
Check it.
- I did fix it properly.

795
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,481
Akhil!

796
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,783
Save me.

797
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,619
Save me.

798
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,226
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

799
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,230
How much more are
you going to beat me?

800
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,665
Are you fine?

801
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:41,801
I am okay.

802
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,102
How's he going to die?

803
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,984
Help! Help!

804
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:55,753
Jugnu, save me.

805
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,554
I'll save you.

806
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:58,922
Akhil, my friend.

807
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,493
Stop it. Stop it. Stop hitting me.

808
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,638
You dog!

809
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:26,178
"Traitor, your heart is a traitor."

810
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:34,862
For you, it doesn't listen to me."

811
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:39,724
"Let's see who wins, head or me."

812
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,498
"Head has become mischeivous."

813
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,097
“I've been habituated to you.“

814
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:49,542
"World say, this is a bad habit."

815
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,247
“I've been habituated to you.“

816
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:54,744
"World say, this is a bad habit."

817
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,284
He's addicted too.

818
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,915
He's gone.

819
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,780
Either he'll be lost in the jungle.

820
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,891
Or he'll be some wild animal's toast.

821
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,824
Let's watch it live.
- Forget it.

822
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,692
Come on.
- Forget it, let him die.

823
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,493
Come on.
It'll be fun.

824
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,645
Careful Akhil, it's really high

825
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,852
Careful. Careful.
- Careful.

826
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,223
Akhil if we fall from here,
we'll get broken into pieces.

827
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,149
Akhil.

828
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,090
Akhil.

829
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:39,092
Akhil.

830
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,558
Stop.

831
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,620
Slop!

832
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,566
Akhil.

833
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,064
Where did my Akhil go?

834
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,710
Get rid of this problem from the root.

835
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:17,531
Why did you hit me?

836
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:18,828
We'll first make him
smell the chloroform.

837
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:19,993
..and then tie him up.

838
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,162
Or tie him up first and
then dope him with chloroform?

839
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,011
Is he gone?

840
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,641
He's done for,
Tie him up.

841
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,552
He'll fall now.

842
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,213
3000 crores is now all ours.

843
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,014
Pick him up.

844
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,817
Jugnu, let's leave him on the terrace.

845
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,624
Once he falls down,
there's no surviving.

846
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:14,821
Oh no...

847
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,642
No!

848
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,719
I won't spare you.

849
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,313
Oh no...

850
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,692
Akhil.
- Jugnu!

851
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:11,642
The dog is hungry.

852
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,681
Pour it.

853
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,145
Pour the entire thing.

854
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,845
He's dead for sure today.

855
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,282
Come on.
- Let's go.

856
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,889
He's dead for sure today.

857
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,191
Drink it sir.

858
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,656
Entertainment.

859
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,023
Drink it.

860
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,227
Entertainment.

861
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,867
Entertainment.

862
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,101
I am so hungry.
I've to get to the court as well.

863
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,873
I am getting late.

864
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,106
Zehreela (poisoned).
- Hey! That's Habibullah!

865
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,276
No. No.

866
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,088
Look, you should never interfere.

867
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:25,617
His head isn't beating.

868
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,148
Do something.

869
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,657
We'll be hanged for it.
Do something.

870
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,056
What do I do? Yes.

871
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,593
Get up.
- Here, Akhil.

872
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,151
Wake him up.

873
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:35,988
Bravo.

874
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,224
Save him somehow.

875
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,828
This is an iron.

876
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,036
Close the door. Close the door.

877
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,979
Rascal, you handed me irons.

878
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,877
Water!
Give me water!

879
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:56,918
My chest is burning.

880
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,551
That mutt Entertainment
has made our life hell.

881
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:02,950
Pannalal you scoundrel.

882
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,926
Who gave you the idea to raise a dog?

883
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,691
Give that here.
- You rascals.

884
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,563
Who are those two with him?
- Open the door.

885
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,863
They look like villains.

886
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:15,867
Look.

887
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,803
He looks like the
villain from Dabbang 1..

888
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,702
..and he is from Dabbang 2. Isn't it?

889
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:23,006
But...how are they connected
with this family?

890
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:32,919
Hey what are you doing?

891
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:34,783
Get up.

892
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:55,164
Very good, brother Karan.

893
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,763
Come on, Arjun.
- Yes.

894
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,138
My Lace is open.

895
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,179
Brother, give me a minute.

896
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,599
I told you,
Arjun, I don't want any goof up.

897
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:31,928
You did.

898
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,666
But mother always said..

899
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,643
..if your shoe-laces are open,
don't run.

900
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,104
Don't be so mad, brother.

901
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,116
I am your own blood.
- Yes.

902
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,776
But because of your actions
I feel like murdering you.

903
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,053
You're a criminal mind, after all..

904
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,054
..it's bound to have such thoughts.

905
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,715
You'll really go far, Arjun.

906
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,191
Wherever you go,
people will say "Keep moving".

907
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,960
You won't be able to
sell yourself if you want to.

908
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,990
I'm sure you were born
after 1000 dogs died.

909
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,194
But you're still alive.

910
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:04,097
You mean...l am a dog?

911
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:06,107
Are you asking or telling,
brother Karan?

912
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,608
Arjun.

913
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:17,041
Mother was right you don't love me.

914
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:20,212
After all, I'm your step-brother.

915
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:26,016
"When has the sun been
away from the sky.."

916
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,063
"..when has the moon been
away from the rays."

917
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,123
"When has aroma been
away from breeze..

918
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,725
..when has spring being
away from the garden"

919
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:41,208
“This is the bond of love.“

920
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:46,145
"Its confluence of many centuries."

921
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:53,579
“This is the bond of love.“

922
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:57,887
"Its confluence of many centuries."

923
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,524
I love you a lot.

924
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,059
<i>You see, were supposed
to be released in 2 days.</i>

925
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,228
But since it was your birthday.

926
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,901
...I planned this escape.

927
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:12,900
You won't find a brother like me.

928
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,703
I can give it in writing.

929
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:19,571
And if there is, then...

930
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,780
You eat.

931
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:31,714
What happened, brother?

932
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,125
Why did your eyes widen?

933
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,861
Pannalal Johri is dead.

934
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,498
This means, brother..

935
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,799
...the one we've trying to kill
all these years, is finally dead.

936
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,862
The old man.

937
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,102
Every time we tried to kill him..

938
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,735
..his pet dog would
interfere and save him.

939
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,613
Brother, now we're the
heir to his 3000 crore..

940
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,844
..because we're his first cousins?

941
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:57,908
Second!

942
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,017
But what's important is...

943
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,013
..we're his only relatives.

944
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,222
Then we should prepare to
get out of here, brother Karan.

945
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,162
Arjun, stop being so brazen.

946
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,766
<i>We'll be released in 2 days.</i>

947
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:19,667
And next day we'll
enter the Johri Mansion.

948
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,977
WOW, Akhil.

949
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,777
I'll have to mention
that it's a fabulous mansion.

950
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,149
So awesome.

951
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,718
It's an exquisite place.

952
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,149
I bet you spent quite a lot on it.

953
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,158
There's an antique fan as well.

954
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:46,725
Is this male or female?

955
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,034
Male or female?

956
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,833
I mean is it Bajaj or Usha?

957
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,944
By the way...the owner of this house..

958
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:03,507
..has gone to his favorite
place Snow white Arena..

959
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,546
..which is 3 hours away from here.

960
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:06,780
Because that's the
only place where it snow falls.

961
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:07,787
I see.

962
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,016
By the way,
what would you like to have?

963
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,559
I will drink. That too neat.

964
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,124
You should've added water.

965
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:18,623
No, no. This is my
daughter's in-laws home.

966
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,027
Water is forbidden for me here.

967
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,733
I would like to get my daughter..

968
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,867
...married to the heir of this house.

969
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,111
The heir of this house?

970
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,168
Yes.

971
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,481
With your daughter?
- Yes.

972
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,246
He's Enter..

973
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,217
Yes, he has already entered...
in her heart

974
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,089
Curses!

975
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,822
He's.. - Exactly,
they are crazy about each other.

976
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,231
Say something.

977
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,228
She keeps barking in the serials.

978
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,936
She barks?
- Yes.

979
00:59:57,227 --> 00:59:58,604
Do something.

980
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,605
Ready?

981
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:00,834
Now see.

982
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,109
Action.

983
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:05,009
Uncle. I swear on God..

984
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,572
..we're two bodies, one soul.
- Wonderful.

985
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:12,581
He's my mornings and my dawn.
- Very good.

986
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:17,785
His feet...is where my pilgrimages lie.
- Wonderful.

987
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,717
He has four legs as well.

988
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,285
But how is this possible?

989
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:22,659
You barked.

990
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,596
Not me, maybe it came from there..

991
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:43,650
See...

992
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,946
...they're eyeing each
other like Romeo-Juliet.

993
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,885
Uncle, this is the effect
of love at first sight.

994
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,733
You mean it's about
love at first bite.

995
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,872
Fine, it's done.
Okay.

996
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:15,515
Come on.

997
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:18,245
Pay respects to your
future father-in-law.

998
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:19,943
Come on.

999
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,512
Pay respects to your
future father-in-law.

1000
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,548
Come, son-in-law.

1001
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,287
Why are you standing there?
Come on.

1002
01:01:59,115 --> 01:01:59,855
What's this?

1003
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:00,894
What's what?

1004
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,196
Not what, what.
What's this?

1005
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,088
He's your son-in-law.

1006
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:08,667
Son...

1007
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:09,794
My..

1008
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,831
The heir to 3000 crore.

1009
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:15,001
Pannalal Johri's heir,
Entertainment.

1010
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,679
You mean...Pannalal Johri..

1011
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:25,777
..gave 3000 crore
to this dog and died.

1012
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:26,912
Yes.

1013
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:33,817
Papa.

1014
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:38,155
Papa, please listen..
- Uncle, please listen.

1015
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,029
Please, listen.

1016
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,226
Give me one more chance.

1017
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,735
I'll keep your daughter happy.

1018
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,634
Just one chance.
I'll be rich.

1019
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,900
I promise you.
Please listen to me.

1020
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:46,872
My fate will change.

1021
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,306
Your fate will never change.

1022
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:49,634
Papa, please.
- Get in.

1023
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,608
You'll always be poor.

1024
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:54,145
What's the point of
being Pannalal Johri's son?

1025
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,779
You turned out to be
a disappointment.

1026
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:58,552
And that dog Entertainment..

1027
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,281
..turned out to be the
real heir to the wealth.

1028
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:01,180
Dog?

1029
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,150
Uncle, listen to me.

1030
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:07,752
Akhil Lokhande,
forget Saakshi forever.

1031
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:16,534
“I want to ask God what has he done.“

1032
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:24,068
"Why did he take back the gift
he had bestowed me upon?"

1033
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:46,697
The heir to 3000 crore...a dog.

1034
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,633
Stop the car!

1035
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,597
What happened?

1036
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,073
Dear...

1037
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:02,079
...do you admit that, post marriage..

1038
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,783
...every man becomes a dog.

1039
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,581
I suggest that...

1040
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:15,596
...you marry the dog.

1041
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,057
Papa!

1042
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:24,560
That rascal Pannalal gave
all his wealth to that dog.

1043
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:30,134
But that dog...separated
me from Saakshi forever, Jugnu.

1044
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,041
That's why, Akhil..

1045
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,839
...we'll have to think
of a full-proof plan..

1046
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,007
..to kill the dog.

1047
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,051
What's to think?
Let's shoot him.

1048
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,916
We won't get the wealth
if we kill the dog.

1049
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,222
It will go to that son of his.

1050
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:44,918
So what do we do?

1051
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,988
Expiry date.

1052
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,161
How long do dogs live?

1053
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,266
Maximum 12-13 years.

1054
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:56,225
That Entertainment
will conk out in few years.

1055
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,104
For now we've just one target.

1056
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:01,674
Akhil.

1057
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,510
And we'll have to
find a special place..

1058
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,808
..to take care of him.

1059
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:12,785
And that special place is...
Snow White Arena.

1060
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:17,821
I will kill that dog
in his favorite place.

1061
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,660
Akhil, you're done for.

1062
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:24,757
Entertainment, you're done for!

1063
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:23,951
I see.

1064
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,117
So tomorrow he's
going to kill the dog.

1065
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,786
And we wolves. .

1066
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,031
.. Will kill him.

1067
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,632
One arrow...we kill two sparrows.

1068
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:38,606
But, brother,
why will we kill sparrows?

1069
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,608
Go...fetch!

1070
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:09,188
Yes.

1071
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:19,833
Die you rascal!

1072
01:08:58,234 --> 01:08:59,110
Akhil!

1073
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,551
Entertainment!

1074
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,824
Entertainment!

1075
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,532
Entertainment!
- Akhil.

1076
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:55,230
Akhil, what are you doing?

1077
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:56,532
Have you gone crazy?

1078
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,968
We got what we wanted.
He's dead.

1079
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,234
He saved my life.

1080
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,274
Entertainment!

1081
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,277
Entertainment!

1082
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,558
Entertainment!

1083
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:23,823
Entertainment!

1084
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,733
Entertainment!

1085
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,196
Akhil.

1086
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,142
Today...

1087
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,976
...an animal taught me
a lesson on humanity.

1088
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:47,680
Akhil.

1089
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:49,413
Akhil.

1090
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,347
Today...

1091
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,848
...an animal taught me
a lesson on humanity.

1092
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:27,684
"What is loyalty and what is trust."

1093
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,654
Entertainment!

1094
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,555
“..I have learnt it from you.“

1095
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:37,360
"What is head and what is love.."

1096
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:41,765
“..I have learnt it from you.“

1097
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:51,538
“I have learnt it from you.“

1098
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:05,655
“I have learnt it from you.“

1099
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:07,993
I must admit, he's two-in-one.

1100
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:09,554
He was Royal.

1101
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,855
But the dog's loyal as well.

1102
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:13,656
Dog?

1103
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,059
No Entenainment.

1104
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:16,626
Entertainment.

1105
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:21,905
Earlier, when we tried
to bump-off Pannalal..

1106
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,841
..the dog interfered.

1107
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,402
And even this time,
he interfered in our plans.

1108
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:28,415
We'll have to do something, Arjun.

1109
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,041
Or that dog will
always taint our face.

1110
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:35,585
By the way,
brother, your face looks tainted.

1111
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,031
Johri sir..

1112
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,432
Mr. Johri..

1113
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,045
Father.

1114
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:13,322
I forgive you for whatever
you did with your this son.

1115
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,588
And for whatever I did with your son..

1116
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:22,258
...I apologies for it.

1117
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,268
I must admit.

1118
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,467
You turned out to be
a true diamond merchant.

1119
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,012
You're a good assessor.

1120
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,047
Entertainment!

1121
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:40,745
Only a real assessor
can recognize a true gem.

1122
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:43,917
Pannalal Johri.

1123
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,728
Your son deserves all this.

1124
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,499
Not this son.

1125
01:14:54,457 --> 01:14:55,834
See you, father.

1126
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:18,750
Entertainment...

1127
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,759
...do you know why the truth hurts.

1128
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,600
Because truth has a point.

1129
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,935
And that point is...

1130
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:33,796
...that you're right and I am wrong.

1131
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,342
Sorry...for trying to kill you.

1132
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,476
Thank you...

1133
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,342
..for showing me the way.

1134
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:47,353
Goodbye.

1135
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,451
And yes...

1136
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,060
...if anyone calls me a dog..

1137
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,824
...I'll consider it an honor.

1138
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,772
Sanjay Leela Bhansali.
- What?

1139
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,414
The names of my three lawyers.

1140
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,679
Mr. Sanjay.
Ms. Leela and Mr. Bhansali.

1141
01:16:54,043 --> 01:16:57,422
Poor chaps have been doing
rounds of the court for us.

1142
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:58,954
Court?
- Yes.

1143
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,391
Films succeed
because of three things.

1144
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,827
And these days our case
is also thriving on three things.

1145
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:03,761
Entertainment!

1146
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:04,890
Entertainment!

1147
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,897
Entertainment!

1148
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,695
What?
- Well, you're forgetting..

1149
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:11,295
..that many years ago,
Pannalal Johri..

1150
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,703
...had started a Private Ltd Company.

1151
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,071
...called The Entertainment Company.

1152
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:16,432
You're right.

1153
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,478
But for his dear Entertainment.

1154
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:23,005
But, Pannalal Johri made
his second cousins, which is us..

1155
01:17:23,272 --> 01:17:24,979
..the major shareholders.

1156
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:29,517
But what did you do under
the pretext of that relation.

1157
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:30,716
Forging!

1158
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,658
Pannalal Johri caught
you two red-handed..

1159
01:17:33,716 --> 01:17:34,990
..and also fired you two.

1160
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:35,990
I see.

1161
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:38,932
Arjun, we didn't receive
any termination order.

1162
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:39,988
Not at all.

1163
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,257
What do you want to prove?

1164
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,270
Just that we're still
the existing owners..

1165
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,999
...of that Entertainment Company.

1166
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:48,875
And according to
Mr. Pannalal Johri's Will...

1167
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:50,408
By the way, why am I talking to you?

1168
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:51,876
Ms. Leela,
I'm sure you've a copy of that Will.

1169
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,002
Please read it out.

1170
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:56,414
I, Pannalal Johri,
in my right state of mind..

1171
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,348
...bequeath my entire property.

1172
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,978
...and bank balance to Entertainment.

1173
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:01,811
Yes!

1174
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,652
Entertainment Company belongs to us..

1175
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,658
...and this property's
in the name of Entertainment.

1176
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,627
So, the heir to 3000 crore
is not this dog, but..

1177
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,632
...it's the owners of the
company called Entertainment!

1178
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,598
Entertainment!

1179
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:15,601
Entertainment!

1180
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:18,331
But in Will, doesn't mention company..

1181
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:21,307
..instead it's loyal dog.

1182
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:26,545
...of the word 'Dog' in the will.

1183
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:29,549
The reason is that he
never considered him a dog.

1184
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:30,640
Court doesn't believe in emotions..

1185
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,413
..it believes n facts, Mr. Dracula.

1186
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,420
That's Habibullah!

1187
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:35,420
And listen.

1188
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:37,616
If there's no 'Dog'
mentioned in the Will..

1189
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,024
...then there's no
'Company' mentioned either.

1190
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:42,761
Very smart.

1191
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,593
And now..
Not you.

1192
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:47,463
In the company of our lawyers,
the court will decide..

1193
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:50,332
..and also prove who's the rascal..

1194
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,838
..and who's a mangy cur.

1195
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:58,540
After all the views..

1196
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,478
...Court is passing the
judgment in the favour of...

1197
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:02,606
Karan and Arjun, They are the
rightful owner Of the Johri Empire.

1198
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:06,346
Pannalal Johri's wealth...
goes to these two rascals!

1199
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,285
How?

1200
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,050
We'll tell you.

1201
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:17,861
You see...a good lawyer knows the law.

1202
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,457
And the best lawyer knows the judge.

1203
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,732
1500 for me..
- And 1500 for me.

1204
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,353
You dog,
I know you understand everything.

1205
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,990
Now listen to me carefully.

1206
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,525
Actually,
you're no more than a street-mutt.

1207
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:55,392
So stay there.

1208
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:58,365
If you need to pee,
then find a lamp-post.

1209
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,538
If you feel hungry.

1210
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,404
..then feed on the left-over
from the waste-dump.

1211
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,034
You're a dog, so live like one.

1212
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:06,745
Right, brother.

1213
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,679
Yes, but before that.

1214
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:10,840
Let's take back what's ours.

1215
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:22,427
What are you doing?

1216
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:25,926
Along with this property,
this leash belongs to us too.

1217
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,400
And stopping us means
breaking the law.

1218
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:32,405
Time flies by when you're with a kin.

1219
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:36,539
But with time you
know who your kin is.

1220
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:46,249
'Look what I brought for you.'

1221
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:48,512
'Look'

1222
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,850
'Just for you.'

1223
01:20:57,653 --> 01:20:59,894
'Since you entered my life..'

1224
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:02,766
<i>' . .there's only entertainment.'</i>

1225
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,735
'No sorrows.'

1226
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:09,466
'You're not my son,
but you're no less either.'

1227
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:24,321
Get out!

1228
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,854
Get out!
- Get lost!

1229
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:27,552
Get lost!

1230
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,660
Johri's dog.
- Got nowhere to go.

1231
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:50,707
Lord, even in your presence..

1232
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,716
Loyalty has lost.

1233
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:57,720
And betrayal won!

1234
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,651
Why are you looking that way?

1235
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:05,521
You think someone
will come to help us..

1236
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:06,930
..from that direction.

1237
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:41,892
Surprised.

1238
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:44,701
How I came back?

1239
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:48,705
I was about to board
the flight to India..

1240
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,009
..when I read this news.

1241
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:12,490
I had to come.

1242
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:14,801
You see, father's last wish was..

1243
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,460
..that you be the heir to this wealth.

1244
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:22,804
And...a son will have
to do something.

1245
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,273
..to fulfill his father's last wish.

1246
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:28,447
After all, I am his blood.

1247
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:30,272
DNA.

1248
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:31,779
Daddy's Najayaz Aulad
(Daddy's illegitimate son).

1249
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,286
But...his son.

1250
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,350
Earlier I formed a bond
with father for the wealth.

1251
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,387
Now, for the sake of that same bond..

1252
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:49,698
...I will get you your wealth back.

1253
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,898
And yes, Entenainment.

1254
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:56,432
We're with you.

1255
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:58,035
Just wait and watch.

1256
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:01,380
We'll first have to break
Karan and Arjun's unity.

1257
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,644
And then their strength will be over.

1258
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:06,853
And then we'll make them
confess to their crimes..

1259
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:09,718
..and have them thrown
out in the streets.

1260
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:10,586
What do you say, Akhil?

1261
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:13,353
Wonderful. Amazing. I'm speechless.

1262
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:16,862
But it's very difficult
to separate these two brothers.

1263
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:21,595
Don't worry about that,
Ab...dulah, sir.

1264
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:27,670
We'll do what the British did with us!

1265
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,941
Divide...and Rule!

1266
01:24:34,336 --> 01:24:36,680
Now we dogs...

1267
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,645
...will teach those rascals a lesson.

1268
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:57,902
Careful, brother.

1269
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:05,071
Entertainment.

1270
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:09,344
I guess he's here for revenge.

1271
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:10,639
Revenge?

1272
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:11,843
You want revenge?

1273
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:13,920
How will you do it?

1274
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,386
Like Rajnikanth.

1275
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,082
Or like Spiderman.

1276
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:21,691
What can one dog do?

1277
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,387
What can he do?

1278
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:26,999
I'll show him...by running
over him with my car. Come on.

1279
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:28,734
Brother, I'll run-over him.

1280
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,292
No, I'll do it, I'm the elder one.

1281
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,268
I am the younger one.

1282
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,805
Why don't you understand?
It's just one dog.

1283
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,363
You won't look good
running over one dog.

1284
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:35,373
I want to run over him.

1285
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:36,932
Brother, do you love me or not?

1286
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:39,501
What's brotherhood
got to do with our love?

1287
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:00,399
Listen to me..
- But..

1288
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:02,901
With this car,
we'll send him off on his final..

1289
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:36,324
Wait!

1290
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:39,271
Stay!

1291
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,568
Sit!

1292
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:50,509
Roadside Entenainment.

1293
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:54,420
At first even I thought
they were wrong.

1294
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:58,857
But the court of
Bangkok opened my eyes.

1295
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:04,396
..and proved that
my father's 3000 crore..

1296
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,364
...belongs to them, and not you.

1297
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:12,802
If anyone has anything to say,
then speak now.

1298
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:17,000
You Bulldog.

1299
01:27:17,866 --> 01:27:19,539
You behave like a dog..

1300
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,979
..but got the name
of a different animal.

1301
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,341
Bull.

1302
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:29,354
Stop growling...Pug!

1303
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:33,625
I'll make you dance like Shakira,
get that.

1304
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:37,453
And you....German Shepherd.

1305
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:41,391
Has your father ever been to Germany?

1306
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,335
And you...Boxer!

1307
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,034
Did your dad ever
put on boxing gloves?

1308
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:51,804
And St. Bernard.

1309
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,871
If I had a face like yours.

1310
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:58,643
...I would've sued my parents.

1311
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:03,846
Now...if anyone has the guts,
then come and face me.

1312
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:10,455
What are you doing?
Go away. Leave.

1313
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:11,494
Leave!

1314
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:14,489
I called for a mobile-tower.

1315
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:16,502
..where did this sim-card come from?

1316
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:19,398
Look, I don't like jokes.

1317
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:22,804
This shorty is no match for me.

1318
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:24,537
Who's got the guts to face me?

1319
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:27,909
Sir, move back.

1320
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,245
They're about to attack, sir.

1321
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:52,702
You're a real player.

1322
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:54,262
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1323
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:54,932
Thank you. Thank you.

1324
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:56,940
Sir, take my advice.
And get out of here in your car.

1325
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:57,702
Go on.
- Yes.

1326
01:28:57,766 --> 01:28:58,870
Let's go.

1327
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:02,942
Akhil.

1328
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,648
Sir, you two hide in the jungle.

1329
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:10,552
I'll deal with them.
- Run!

1330
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:14,518
"Who let the dogs out?"

1331
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:18,361
"Who let the dogs out?"

1332
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:21,830
"Who let the dogs out?"

1333
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:25,633
"Who let the dogs out?"

1334
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:29,505
"Who let the dogs out?"

1335
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:33,376
"Who let the dogs out?"

1336
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:41,684
Akhil.

1337
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:43,347
Akhil.
- What?

1338
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,446
Down there.

1339
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,581
Oh my Dog!

1340
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:47,592
Oh my Dog!

1341
01:29:47,649 --> 01:29:51,620
Sir, your death's between his jaws.

1342
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:53,291
What do I do?

1343
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:53,991
Reverse psychology.

1344
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:55,563
Reverse psychology.

1345
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:56,997
He wants you to worry.

1346
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,704
But you laugh instead.
Laugh.

1347
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:04,302
Before he blows your fuse,
confuse the dog.

1348
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:06,641
The ball is in his court

1349
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:09,572
Help!

1350
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:10,974
Akhil.

1351
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:12,416
Oh my Dog!

1352
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:15,584
Help! Save me.

1353
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:17,384
Oh my Dog!

1354
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:18,924
Save us both.

1355
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:19,924
Save you both.

1356
01:30:21,316 --> 01:30:22,659
Idea, sir.

1357
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,863
Where are you going?

1358
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,263
Sir...don't worry.

1359
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:31,403
I have in my clutches,
the leader of these dogs.

1360
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:34,633
Call your friends back.

1361
01:30:34,696 --> 01:30:36,334
Tell them to get out of here.
- Akhil.

1362
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:37,637
Say it aloud.

1363
01:30:38,233 --> 01:30:38,973
Yes!

1364
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,384
Bite me. Pretend to bite me.

1365
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:48,378
He bit me.

1366
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:53,653
Amazing.

1367
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:56,292
You almost killed that dog.

1368
01:30:56,351 --> 01:30:58,558
Sir, am I cigarette to kill him.

1369
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,461
I mean you scattered them like leaves.

1370
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:02,559
Am I a leaf-blower?

1371
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:05,662
We mean you stole our hearts.

1372
01:31:05,727 --> 01:31:07,707
Am I the government who will steal?

1373
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,673
I see. Fire with satire.

1374
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:11,574
Brave man. Brave man.

1375
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:13,579
Please look after yourself.

1376
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,380
Especially from those dogs.

1377
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:16,847
Today they were a 100...

1378
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:18,316
..tomorrow they can come back as 200.

1379
01:31:18,373 --> 01:31:20,353
He bit me really hard.
- Show.

1380
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:21,682
Show.
- Forget it.

1381
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:23,450
Show it.
- What can you do?

1382
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:24,546
See you.

1383
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,722
Arjun, he's right.

1384
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:31,363
Brother, shall we hire him.

1385
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:32,489
Let's do.

1386
01:31:32,554 --> 01:31:33,658
It will be fun.

1387
01:31:33,688 --> 01:31:34,689
The heir to 3000 crore..

1388
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:37,429
...will be our servant
and do our bidding.

1389
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:40,302
And he'll also protect us.

1390
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:41,965
We'll have our cakes
and get to eat it too.

1391
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,804
Don't remind me of that.

1392
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:45,366
<i>Sorry!</i>

1393
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:46,571
Where did he go?

1394
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:47,544
Are they back?

1395
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,449
<i>No, no, no, listen.</i>

1396
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:52,509
Will you work for us?

1397
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:54,746
Driver... - Cum Bodyguard..
- Cum Watchman.

1398
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:55,412
Cum..

1399
01:31:55,476 --> 01:32:01,859
Since you're insisting so much...
I'll come.

1400
01:32:03,418 --> 01:32:04,988
Made in Thailand.

1401
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:08,626
Sell in thairon

1402
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,101
Sell in thairon

1403
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:17,065
Made in Thailand.

1404
01:32:17,332 --> 01:32:18,811
Why did you stop?

1405
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:21,073
Sir...the castor oil's over.

1406
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:23,611
I'll go get it.
- Quickly.

1407
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:25,642
Hello.
- Akhil.

1408
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,879
Saakshi.
- Akhil.

1409
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:28,420
Where are you?
- In Bangkok.

1410
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:30,854
Whose Kok?
- I am in Bangkok.

1411
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,786
Oh, you're in Bangkok.

1412
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:36,317
Akhil, father's trying
to find me a NRI husband.

1413
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:38,019
<i>He still has 2 months
left on his tourist visa.</i>

1414
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,663
What kind of Dad, you gave birth to?

1415
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:40,756
You..
- Saakshi.

1416
01:32:40,822 --> 01:32:42,028
Saakshi. Saakshi.
- Yes, papa.

1417
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,598
Saakshi. listen.

1418
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:46,329
I've found an NRI husband for you.

1419
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:51,376
He only doesn't have hand and limbs.

1420
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:54,705
Sometimes you'll have to
take him to the mall in this bag.

1421
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,040
Papa!

1422
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:58,477
Where are you getting
the castor oil from?

1423
01:32:58,539 --> 01:32:59,950
Where are you, Akhil?

1424
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:02,521
I am back.

1425
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:05,615
Don't get bored,
I'll switch on the television.

1426
01:33:09,484 --> 01:33:10,554
WOW!

1427
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,587
Indian woman!

1428
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:15,399
Virtues on her mind, sari on her body.

1429
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:17,566
Don't bore me.

1430
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:24,843
This is what you call beauty.

1431
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:27,504
One piece item in two piece bikini.

1432
01:33:27,535 --> 01:33:28,809
"Looks amazing."

1433
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:32,278
Bikinis don't have the etiquette..

1434
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:33,876
...that a 'Sari' and
'Salwar Kameez' have.

1435
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:34,885
Have you heard that song?

1436
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,047
Have you?
- Which one?

1437
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,914
"She looked amazing..

1438
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:39,491
"..covered in the veil."

1439
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,059
Sir's right. He's right.

1440
01:33:41,316 --> 01:33:42,624
She looked amazing..

1441
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:44,856
..because she was
covered only in a viel.

1442
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:46,989
Sir, the young sir's right as well.

1443
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:49,865
Bindi on the forehead,
kohl in the eyes..

1444
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,597
..that's what you call a girl.

1445
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:54,004
A girl is someone
who has no cover or slip.

1446
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,369
Just long legs.

1447
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,410
Shut up!

1448
01:33:57,598 --> 01:33:59,600
'Sanskrit', 'Sabhyata', 'Sanskaar'.
(Cultured, Civilized, Virtue).

1449
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,613
Sexy, seductive, sensuality.

1450
01:34:01,769 --> 01:34:05,012
The girl should be
reflection of your mother.

1451
01:34:05,073 --> 01:34:07,883
I've the perfect idea
for 'Divide and Rule'.

1452
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,322
I'll have to bring
Saakshi in the picture.

1453
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:12,451
And for that I'll have to find..

1454
01:34:12,914 --> 01:34:15,019
...a millionaire
son-in-law for his father.

1455
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:21,366
Dear, finally I found
a millionaire son-in-law.

1456
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:24,763
Your education.
- B.Com.

1457
01:34:24,892 --> 01:34:28,465
I'm B.Com.
- Who cares what ‘Com’ (religion) you are.

1458
01:34:29,364 --> 01:34:32,436
Are you educated?
- Yes.

1459
01:34:33,868 --> 01:34:36,712
Saakshi, what's your favorite color?

1460
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:38,509
Yellow.

1461
01:34:38,573 --> 01:34:40,416
Yellow! Yellow!

1462
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:46,020
Dear, then you'll
definitely like his teeth.

1463
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,928
Son, show her your teeth.

1464
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,290
Papa, he's got three
negative qualities.

1465
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:54,965
He smokes, drinks and gambles.

1466
01:34:55,323 --> 01:34:56,529
Excuse me.

1467
01:34:56,824 --> 01:34:58,360
I've something positive as well.

1468
01:34:58,426 --> 01:34:59,564
Tell her. Tell her.

1469
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:00,901
I am HIV+

1470
01:35:03,498 --> 01:35:04,977
Papa, not here. Papa, not here.
Papa, not here.

1471
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:09,314
"Johnny Johnny.."

1472
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,008
'Johnny Johnny. .

1473
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:12,983
'Johnny Johnny. .

1474
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,020
'Johnny Johnny. .

1475
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:18,853
“I've not been drinking.“

1476
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:22,725
“I've not been drinking.“

1477
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:26,658
“I've been forced to drink.“

1478
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:30,533
“I've been forced to drink.“

1479
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:45,678
I had sworn, first millionaire..

1480
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,020
..then Saakshi's husband.

1481
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:50,781
You? Millionaire?

1482
01:35:50,845 --> 01:35:52,347
It's the dog who's rich.

1483
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:53,551
How did you get rich?

1484
01:35:53,614 --> 01:35:56,993
You see...Entertainment
transferred all his wealth..

1485
01:35:57,018 --> 01:35:58,656
to Akhil Johri...

1486
01:35:59,320 --> 01:35:59,923
Sorry, sir.

1487
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,592
And made him rich.

1488
01:36:01,656 --> 01:36:03,465
<i>How?
- BY Putting his paw</i>

1489
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,935
Habibullah sir, please show him.

1490
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:08,302
Show him.

1491
01:36:08,663 --> 01:36:09,835
Take a look.

1492
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:11,535
The paw is right here.

1493
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:17,047
Show me as well.

1494
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:20,986
Papa, it's true.

1495
01:36:21,476 --> 01:36:23,615
My beloved's here to hold my hand..

1496
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:26,419
..in his hi-fi boat.
- Star Plus, stop.

1497
01:36:27,482 --> 01:36:30,292
Hey, Jamila.
- Hey! That's Habibullah.

1498
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:31,728
Fine, fine.

1499
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:32,863
Tell me something.

1500
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:35,663
What overcame this dog..

1501
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:37,430
..that he gave his wealth to him.

1502
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,002
Entenainment says..

1503
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,501
..how can the master's
son be a servant.

1504
01:36:41,562 --> 01:36:42,632
I see.

1505
01:36:42,697 --> 01:36:45,803
Him...this dog...said that to you.

1506
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:46,810
Like this.

1507
01:36:46,868 --> 01:36:47,938
I mean he spoke from his mouth.

1508
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:49,948
Where do you speak from?

1509
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:54,484
I knew it, you won't believe all this.

1510
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:56,486
This dog speaks.
Watch.

1511
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:01,550
Entertainment, tell them
what rose up in stock market today.

1512
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:03,962
See the prices rose up.

1513
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,723
Tell us one city of Gujarat.

1514
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:08,364
See. Bhavnagar.

1515
01:37:09,524 --> 01:37:11,026
What should we never
differentiate between?

1516
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:11,963
Differences

1517
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:13,838
See.

1518
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:16,302
Hey stop your nonsense.

1519
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:18,070
Do you think he's crazy?

1520
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:22,471
You think you'll take my Saakshi..

1521
01:37:22,537 --> 01:37:24,813
...I mean his Saakshi
by doing this antics.

1522
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:25,748
And he'll agree.

1523
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:29,755
Why wouldn't I?
I'll give him a hug.

1524
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:32,751
This dog has made him rich.

1525
01:37:32,913 --> 01:37:34,859
Akhil, Saakshi's all yours.

1526
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:36,554
And you get lost.

1527
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:38,255
Get lost!

1528
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:39,656
Son.

01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,859
Here's the engagement ring.

Diamond.

1531

Give me a hug, son.

1536
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:52,344
The king's finally got his queen.

1537
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,004
I got my Saakshi.

1538
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:01,976
Karan-Arjun.

1539
01:38:02,777 --> 01:38:04,279
Your idea isn't bad.

1540
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:06,291
But..
- No ifs or buts, sister-in-law.

1541
01:38:06,314 --> 01:38:07,588
We just need your dates.

1542
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:09,719
Please don't refuse us.

1543
01:38:09,784 --> 01:38:11,525
Because you're only hope.

1544
01:38:11,585 --> 01:38:15,397
You see, you'll have
to work your charm in a humble way.

1545
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:16,932
Otherwise we'll be...
- Jugnu!

1546
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,061
In a big mess.

1547
01:38:18,326 --> 01:38:19,828
Listen to me.

1548
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:25,607
I'll help all of you to create
a rift between Karan and Arjun.

1549
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,241
Wonderful.

1550
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:31,977
And also get Entertainment his right.

1551
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:35,285
Do you know why?

1552
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:38,723
This man here...

1553
01:38:39,881 --> 01:38:41,019
...is my life.

1554
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:44,263
And you saved his life.

1555
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:46,387
Thank you.

1556
01:38:48,522 --> 01:38:49,830
Just wait and watch..

1557
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:52,865
..how I will fulfill your desires.

1558
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:56,274
Now I'll separate those two..

1559
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:59,840
..posing as Savitri for
Karan and Sonia for Arjun.

1560
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:01,903
Swear on Balaji.

1561
01:39:02,537 --> 01:39:05,040
Swear on Balaji.
- My baby.

1562
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:32,735
"Why do you wander here and there?"

1563
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,006
"O little buddy!"

1564
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:36,441
“I'll hypnotize your heart.“

1565
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:39,608
“I like your synchronized moves.“

1566
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:40,777
"O little buddy!"

1567
01:39:40,842 --> 01:39:43,482
"Baby I got my eyes on you."

1568
01:39:43,845 --> 01:39:45,586
"From the tip to the toes
To the lip to the nose."

1569
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,284
“Make it wiggle.. wiggle.“

1570
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:48,850
"Don't give me the dose of love,
it's daily squabble."

1571
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,691
“Make it jiggle.- jiggle?'

1572
01:39:50,717 --> 01:39:54,460
“I am getting a little naughty.“

1573
01:39:54,522 --> 01:39:56,627
“I want you to get mischievous too.“

1574
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,465
"O little buddy!"

1575
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,329
"O little buddy!"

1576
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:04,467
“I am getting a little naughty.“

1577
01:40:04,532 --> 01:40:07,411
“I want you to get mischievous.“

1578
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:11,348
"And if something untoward happens."

1579
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:13,783
"It'll be so much fun."

1580
01:40:14,408 --> 01:40:17,878
"Do you or do you not?"

1581
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:20,824
"Do you trust me or not?"

1582
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:23,725
“Your benevolence's is beyond par.“

1583
01:40:23,784 --> 01:40:27,391
"How I wonder you are."

1584
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:30,465
“Your benevolence's is beyond par.“

1585
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:33,937
"How I wonder you are."

1586
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:37,965
“Your benevolence's is beyond par.“

1587
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:42,547
"O little buddy!"

1588
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,819
"The garland around
my neck is meant for you."

1589
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:58,657
“I've hidden your photo in my wallet.“

1590
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:05,260
"The garland around
my neck is meant for you."

1591
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:08,671
“I've hidden your photo in my wallet.“

1592
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:11,938
“I understand that you do.“

1593
01:41:11,999 --> 01:41:14,980
“I understand that you love me.“

1594
01:41:15,035 --> 01:41:17,777
“Your benevolence's is beyond par.“

1595
01:41:17,838 --> 01:41:21,445

"How I wonder you are."

1598
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:32,392
“Your benevolence's is beyond par.“

1599
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:35,627
“Every book of love is about
sin and merit.“

1600
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:38,899
"Minus 1, 2, 3
ain't no lunches for free."

1601
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:42,372
“Every book of love is about
sin and merit.“

1602
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:45,842
"So beg, borrow and run,
ain't no lunches for free."

1603
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:49,313
"How long am I going
to just watch and yearn?"

1604
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:50,815
“I've played the semi-final.“

1605
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:52,714
"When are we going
to play the finals?"

1606
01:41:57,011 --> 01:42:00,083
"How long am I going
to just watch and yearn?"

1607
01:42:00,347 --> 01:42:01,826
“I've played the semi-final.“

1608
01:42:01,882 --> 01:42:03,793
"When are we going
to play the finals?"

1609
01:42:03,818 --> 01:42:10,064
“I am also waiting for it.“

1610
01:42:10,324 --> 01:42:12,827
“Your benevolence's. . .“

1611
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:16,541
“Your benevolence's is beyond par.“

1612
01:42:16,597 --> 01:42:19,908
"How I wonder you are."

1613
01:42:20,501 --> 01:42:23,277
“Your benevolence's is beyond par.“

1614
01:42:23,337 --> 01:42:26,750
"How I wonder you are."

1615
01:42:27,008 --> 01:42:30,046
“Your benevolence's is beyond par.“

1616
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:37,788
"O little buddy!"

1617
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:41,060
"Your benevolence .."

1618
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:42,767
Love's making me fly.

1619
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:44,496
Trapped..

1620
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:45,559
What?

1621
01:42:45,626 --> 01:42:47,333
In love.

1622
01:42:47,795 --> 01:42:50,833
Sir's in love.

1623
01:42:51,532 --> 01:42:53,569
Who's the fonunate?

1624
01:42:54,034 --> 01:42:56,674
I am the fortunate boy.

1625
01:42:56,804 --> 01:43:00,445
You know,
I am in love with my 36-24-36.

1626
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:03,454
I love you Sonia.
- No!

1627
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,989
Really? You swear.

1628
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:06,046
And she's on her way here.

1629
01:43:06,313 --> 01:43:08,850
Tell her about your feelings, sir.

1630
01:43:10,417 --> 01:43:11,794
You're right.
- Yes.

1631
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,725
Today I will tell
her about my feelings,

1632
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:17,331
I..
- Hey, Villain!

1633
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:22,872
"Why do you wander here and there?"

1634
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,668
Sir...

1635
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:28,641
Sir, what just happened?

1636
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:31,372
She has stripped all her clothes.

1637
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:34,515
The virtuous saga has
become a vulgar story.

1638
01:43:35,309 --> 01:43:38,449
She's wearing a new-born
baby's outfit, sir.

1639
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:39,786
Take a look, sir.

1640
01:43:39,847 --> 01:43:42,555
Sir, for my sake take a look.

1641
01:43:42,749 --> 01:43:44,558
Sir, take a look.

1642
01:43:45,019 --> 01:43:49,832
I knew it, you'll be
stupefied to see me like this.

1643
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:52,464
Close your mouth.

1644
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:56,306
Sir, she's completely covered.

1645
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:58,899
Such snowfall on the bare mountain.

1646
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:00,639
I love someone else.

1647
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:04,848
And he's the one who's
given me this fashion.

1648
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:09,783
And he's someone who
knew we had a connection.

1649
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:12,821
..but still he gave
me a new definition of love.

1650
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,325
Who is he?

1651
01:44:14,648 --> 01:44:15,820
Your brother.

1652
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:16,953
Sir.

1653
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:19,588
Brother has betrayed his brother.

1654
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,458
Brother has betrayed his brother.

1655
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:25,632
<i>Karen!</i>

1656
01:44:26,293 --> 01:44:27,795
<i>Arjun!</i>

1657
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:37,747
What will you say now?

1658
01:44:38,405 --> 01:44:40,407
What will you say to me?
- Correct.

1659
01:44:40,741 --> 01:44:43,984
I was the one who talked,
you always cheated. Cheat.

1660
01:44:44,044 --> 01:44:45,853
Insulting your elder brother.

1661
01:44:46,313 --> 01:44:47,417
Don't forget...

1662
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:49,690
...when you were in
your mother's womb..

1663
01:44:49,817 --> 01:44:51,057
...I was in 1st grade.

1664
01:44:51,318 --> 01:44:52,422
Hold on.

1665
01:44:52,853 --> 01:44:55,697
When I was in 5th grade,
you were still in 1st.

1666
01:44:55,756 --> 01:44:56,826
So what?

1667
01:44:57,558 --> 01:44:59,936
But I was the one who
looked after you the most.

1668
01:45:01,529 --> 01:45:02,564
Remember...

1669
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:05,533
...when mother used to
tell us ghost stories.

1670
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:06,974
..you used to get scared.

1671
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:10,006
And who used to hold your hands?

1672
01:45:10,538 --> 01:45:11,516
You.

1673
01:45:11,572 --> 01:45:12,846
Because you were scared of ghosts.

1674
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:14,579
That's why you used to hold my hands.

1675
01:45:14,608 --> 01:45:17,487
You're an expert
in humiliating people.

1676
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:19,880
Now you tried to tarnish my honor.

1677
01:45:19,947 --> 01:45:21,756
Right now you're stealing my dialogue.

1678
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:22,919
You're the one who tarnished my honor.

1679
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:24,690
Arjun.

1680
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:28,292
I've two minds to hit you.

1681
01:45:28,355 --> 01:45:30,801
Rubbish, you don't
even have a single mind.

1682
01:45:30,858 --> 01:45:33,464
Arjun!

1683
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:34,966
Hit him. Hit him.
- Hit him!

1684
01:45:36,797 --> 01:45:37,707
Hit him!

1685
01:45:37,765 --> 01:45:39,039
Divide and rule. Hit him!

1686
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:42,972
Mother was right.

1687
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:45,579
You don't love me.

1688
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:48,475
After all I'm your step-brother.

1689
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:52,622
"When has the sun been
away from the sky.."

1690
01:45:52,646 --> 01:45:55,718
"..when has the moon been
away from the rays."

1691
01:45:55,749 --> 01:45:58,992
"When has aroma been
away from breeze..

1692
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:00,588
From where is this playing?

1693
01:46:01,322 --> 01:46:07,762
“This is the bond of love.“

1694
01:46:07,828 --> 01:46:09,705
"Its confluence of many centuries."

1695
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:10,969
You keep the girl.

1696
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,066
No, brother. You're the elder one.

1697
01:46:12,332 --> 01:46:13,504
You keep her.

1698
01:46:13,567 --> 01:46:15,911
To hell with the cheap
girl who tries to separate us.

1699
01:46:18,806 --> 01:46:20,649
They both turned out to be over-smart

1700
01:46:21,475 --> 01:46:23,978
Because they know, if they separate..

1701
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:27,282
..they will have to divide the wealth.

1702
01:46:28,582 --> 01:46:30,687
Earlier they were separate,
but now they are one.

1703
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:31,729
One!

1704
01:46:31,785 --> 01:46:33,787
Akhil, our plan's flopped.

1705
01:46:34,021 --> 01:46:35,728
Why don't you find a new solution?

1706
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:37,769
Am I a scientist to find a solution?

1707
01:46:37,824 --> 01:46:39,428
I mean find a way.

1708
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:41,871
I am a traffic constable
to find the way?

1709
01:46:41,995 --> 01:46:45,499
We'll have to find a mode.
- Am I a farmer to find a mode?

1710
01:46:45,832 --> 01:46:46,537
No!

1711
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,376
These Karan Arjun are really unique.

1712
01:46:49,670 --> 01:46:51,707
Sometimes their mother's
song starts playing.

1713
01:46:51,772 --> 01:46:53,718
Sometimes their
mother's ghost stories..

1714
01:46:57,010 --> 01:46:58,045
Hold on!

1715
01:46:59,046 --> 01:47:00,491
'It's a ghost film.

1716
01:47:00,681 --> 01:47:02,388
I am scared .'

1717
01:47:03,884 --> 01:47:05,454
Ghost.
- Ghost?

1718
01:47:05,686 --> 01:47:08,963
Yes, I've seen and heard myself.

1719
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:14,597
Karan and Arjun are scared of ghosts.

1720
01:47:14,661 --> 01:47:15,833
Really?
- Yes.

1721
01:47:17,063 --> 01:47:21,068
Now we'll bring a ghost in their life.

1722
01:47:22,836 --> 01:47:27,478
But we need a ghost or spirit
or dead body to scare them.

1723
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:28,315
We have a dead body.

1724
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:28,819
Whose?

1725
01:47:29,977 --> 01:47:36,485
Arjun, when I drink a peg,
I don't listen to anyone.

1726
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,662
Brother, when I drink two pegs..

1727
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:41,959
...I don't listen to myself.

1728
01:47:42,422 --> 01:47:43,457
I see!

1729
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:48,902
When I drink three pegs...
no one listens to me.

1730
01:47:51,565 --> 01:47:56,981
Rascal, entertaining yourself.

1731
01:47:58,372 --> 01:48:02,878
My Entertainment died
of hunger and thirst.

1732
01:48:07,348 --> 01:48:08,827
Congratulations.

1733
01:48:08,882 --> 01:48:10,953
Make another peg.

1734
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:13,024
How about a drink, Gorilla.

1735
01:48:13,287 --> 01:48:14,994
That's Habibullah.

1736
01:48:16,456 --> 01:48:18,595
My Karan-Arjun will come.

1737
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,704
My Karan-Arjun will surely come.

1738
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:26,343
Huh, My Entertainment will come.

1739
01:48:26,767 --> 01:48:32,376
You made him worry,
his soul won't spare you.

1740
01:48:32,605 --> 01:48:35,609
His spirit will come after you.

1741
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:37,516
Let go.

1742
01:48:41,415 --> 01:48:42,416
Sir.

1743
01:48:42,482 --> 01:48:43,688
Sir, it's me.

1744
01:48:43,717 --> 01:48:44,661
Me.

1745
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:45,822
Me.

1746
01:48:46,486 --> 01:48:47,794
Tell him it's me.

1747
01:48:47,855 --> 01:48:49,596
It's him.
- Your servant.

1748
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:50,961
Right.

1749
01:48:58,932 --> 01:49:01,606
They say as soon as
you kill a pet animal..

1750
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:04,312
...their spirit starts
wandering around.

1751
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:07,546
That's exactly
what I used to say.

1752
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:08,651
Get lost!

1753
01:49:08,842 --> 01:49:10,378
But, no sir.

1754
01:49:11,412 --> 01:49:15,656
After what happened
with my friend Billa..

1755
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:16,626
That's it.

1756
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:19,061
What happened with Billa?
- Nothing.

1757
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:20,855
Tell us.
- Nothing.

1758
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:21,763
No, no.
- Say it.

1759
01:49:21,821 --> 01:49:22,731
No, no..
- Forget it, brother.

1760
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:23,859
Listen.

1761
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:27,804
Once my friend Billa..

1762
01:49:28,662 --> 01:49:31,973
...killed a cat on a moonless night.

1763
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:34,371
Billa killed a cat.
- Yes.

1764
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:37,975
The same night,
when she was murdered..

1765
01:49:39,773 --> 01:49:43,778
..Billa was sitting
on his rocking chair.

1766
01:49:45,645 --> 01:49:46,715
And the chair..

1767
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:54,027
Why's the chair squeaking so much?

1768
01:49:54,321 --> 01:49:55,732
It was second-hand, sir.

1769
01:49:56,657 --> 01:50:00,332
On that dark night,
a dark crow sitting on a dark branch..

1770
01:50:00,694 --> 01:50:02,674
..Started squawking loudly.

1771
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:14,340
And the door to Billa's
room started opening.

1772
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:20,417
Why's the door opening for so long?

1773
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:21,926
It's opening in slow motion.

1774
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:23,928
It's opening in slow motion.

1775
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:27,264
As soon as the door opened..

1776
01:50:28,388 --> 01:50:31,369
..Billa was facing the cat.

1777
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:35,702
The cat's head was in her paw.

1778
01:50:37,531 --> 01:50:39,977
And she was sweetly saying..

1779
01:50:42,969 --> 01:50:44,004
What did she say?

1780
01:50:47,707 --> 01:50:49,345
Say it loudly.

1781
01:50:49,776 --> 01:50:51,255
Meow!

1782
01:50:52,846 --> 01:50:54,826
Me-ow!

1783
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:57,895
Me-ow!

1784
01:50:57,951 --> 01:51:00,295
What did Billa say?
- Billa screamed.

1785
01:51:00,354 --> 01:51:01,355
What?

1786
01:51:01,688 --> 01:51:03,326
I had killed the cat.

1787
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:04,764
But the cat said...

1788
01:51:05,926 --> 01:51:10,272
Is it your wedding night
that you killed the cat?

1789
01:51:10,897 --> 01:51:12,740
Hearing this Billa was stunned.

1790
01:51:13,533 --> 01:51:14,978
..just like you two are.

1791
01:51:15,335 --> 01:51:17,611
The cat jumped in Billa's mouth..

1792
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:20,379
..and came out the
same way you're scared

1793
01:51:20,441 --> 01:51:23,320
...came out the same way
you're scared.

1794
01:51:23,377 --> 01:51:24,822
You're ruined.

1795
01:51:24,878 --> 01:51:26,357
You're two ruined.

1796
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:23,612
Help.

1797
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,717
"Johnny Johnny.."

1798
01:52:30,577 --> 01:52:32,420
"Johnny Johnny.."

1799
01:52:40,753 --> 01:52:43,700
Who switched on the television?

1800
01:53:21,027 --> 01:53:22,005
Hello.

1801
01:53:23,496 --> 01:53:24,668
Hello.

1802
01:53:24,998 --> 01:53:26,477
Hello.

1803
01:53:26,767 --> 01:53:27,837
Hello.

1804
01:53:28,835 --> 01:53:29,870
Hello.

1805
01:53:30,503 --> 01:53:30,981
Hello.

1806
01:53:31,037 --> 01:53:31,742
Hello.

1807
01:53:31,905 --> 01:53:32,781
Hello.

1808
01:53:32,839 --> 01:53:33,874
Hello.

1809
01:53:53,526 --> 01:53:55,403
Ghost!

1810
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:00,602
Ghost!

1811
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:05,913
Entertainment!

1812
01:54:05,972 --> 01:54:07,349
Entertainment!

1813
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:14,052
Sir.

1814
01:54:14,981 --> 01:54:16,085
Sir.

1815
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:18,852
Here I am.
- Where?

1816
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:20,525
Look. Here.

1817
01:54:20,587 --> 01:54:21,998
Back here.

1818
01:54:23,023 --> 01:54:25,401
Why did you climb up on the deer?
- Ghost.

1819
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:27,438
Sir, there's no ghost.

1820
01:54:27,494 --> 01:54:29,496
This is a conspiracy to scare you.

1821
01:54:29,563 --> 01:54:31,634
So that you suffer
a head-attack and die.

1822
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:33,371
What are you saying?

1823
01:54:33,433 --> 01:54:34,912
Didn't you hear?

1824
01:54:34,968 --> 01:54:35,946
I'll say it again.

1825
01:54:36,002 --> 01:54:37,037
This is a conspiracy to scare you.

1826
01:54:37,304 --> 01:54:39,545
So that you suffer
a head-attack and die.

1827
01:54:39,606 --> 01:54:41,643
Who wants to kill me?
- Who?

1828
01:54:42,309 --> 01:54:44,311
Your own brother.
Step-brother.

1829
01:54:44,377 --> 01:54:45,515
You don't believe me, do you?
- No.

1830
01:54:45,578 --> 01:54:46,750
I was cleaning your brother's room..

1831
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:47,883
..and you know what I found.

1832
01:54:47,948 --> 01:54:49,757
This. Vacuum cleaner.

1833
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:52,762
They were trying to scare
you using this on the dog.

1834
01:54:53,353 --> 01:54:53,922
On the ceiling.

1835
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:55,466
This CD player.

1836
01:54:55,522 --> 01:54:57,763
It's a recording of scary voices.

1837
01:54:57,824 --> 01:55:00,464
By showing you a
DVD of duplicate dog..

1838
01:55:00,527 --> 01:55:01,938
..and putting a wig on him.

1839
01:55:01,995 --> 01:55:05,602
By scaring you to death
or driving you crazy..

1840
01:55:05,665 --> 01:55:08,737
..he wants to be the
heir to the entire 3000 crore.

1841
01:55:08,802 --> 01:55:09,872
Meaning?

1842
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:13,008
Time flies by when you're with a kin.

1843
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:16,816
But with time you
know who your kin is.

1844
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:19,956
Karan!
- Arjun!

1845
01:55:25,351 --> 01:55:27,558
You'll have to pay dearly
for locking horns with me.

1846
01:55:27,887 --> 01:55:28,797
Right.

1847
01:55:28,855 --> 01:55:31,461
As if I'm offering discount
on locking horns with me.

1848
01:55:31,624 --> 01:55:36,937
I respected you equal to god,
but you turned out to be a Godzilla.

1849
01:55:36,997 --> 01:55:41,343
I thought we were of same blood,
but you turned out to be a Blood Cancer.

1850
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:44,038
What if their mother's
song starts playing again?

1851
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:46,378
Akhil, our plan will flop.

1852
01:55:46,572 --> 01:55:47,642
Do something.

1853
01:55:47,707 --> 01:55:49,812
I will have to raise my hand today.

1854
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:51,480
I'm not a coward.

1855
01:55:51,911 --> 01:55:53,447
Will you hit me?

1856
01:55:53,513 --> 01:55:54,355
Yes, I will.

1857
01:55:54,414 --> 01:55:56,917
Will you hit your elder brother?
- Yes, I will.

1858
01:55:56,983 --> 01:55:59,429
Enough, Arjun.
- Get lost.

1859
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:01,590
Enough, Arjun..
- I am your step brother.

1860
01:56:01,654 --> 01:56:05,727
“This is the bond of love.“

1861
01:56:12,399 --> 01:56:13,605
How dare you hit your elder brother?

1862
01:56:13,666 --> 01:56:15,646
And you..
- Don't say a word.

1863
01:56:16,002 --> 01:56:17,379
Get lost!

1864
01:56:18,872 --> 01:56:20,715
Shoot it. Shoot it.
- I am.

1865
01:56:20,773 --> 01:56:23,253
I bribed the judge
to make you a millionaire.

1866
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:24,686
Stop barking.

1867
01:56:24,744 --> 01:56:26,485
That dog's the real heir.

1868
01:56:29,349 --> 01:56:31,852
You cheated everyone, me too.

1869
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:37,802
Come on. Our job's done.

1870
01:56:49,269 --> 01:56:50,270
DVD?

1871
01:56:54,374 --> 01:56:55,375
Brother, DVD?

1872
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:56,715
DVD from above.

1873
01:56:56,943 --> 01:56:59,549
That means someone's
recording our conversation.

1874
01:56:59,746 --> 01:57:00,850
Show me.

1875
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,055
Hey!

1876
01:57:08,755 --> 01:57:10,063
Entenainment is alive.

1877
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:11,961
He was never dead, sir.

1878
01:57:15,995 --> 01:57:21,001
I may not be God-gifted,
but I'm definitely dog-gifted.

1879
01:57:22,869 --> 01:57:23,870
And she's..

1880
01:57:23,936 --> 01:57:26,439
I am not your Savitri or your Sonia.

1881
01:57:26,506 --> 01:57:27,780
I am just his Saakshi.

1882
01:57:28,341 --> 01:57:29,547
And thanks to this CD..

1883
01:57:29,609 --> 01:57:32,556
...this wealth will
be once be Entertainment's.

1884
01:57:32,612 --> 01:57:33,590
Greetings.

1885
01:57:34,314 --> 01:57:37,989
In shonmyour days are over.

1886
01:57:38,885 --> 01:57:42,025
And you'll pay for your deeds in jail.

1887
01:57:42,288 --> 01:57:43,631
Absolutely wrong.

1888
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,837
I'll crush you, Akhil.

1889
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:48,668
Are you flour?

1890
01:57:49,629 --> 01:57:50,630
Say something.

1891
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:54,038
I will wash you down.
- Are you a bucket.

1892
01:57:56,369 --> 01:57:58,940
We will finish you?
- Are you climax?

1893
01:58:00,673 --> 01:58:01,811
BOYS!

1894
01:58:01,875 --> 01:58:04,048
Snatch the DVD from this dog.

1895
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:05,853
Entertainment...run!

1896
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:48,731
Sunny Deol has turned
into Sunny Leone.

1897
01:58:59,632 --> 01:59:00,610
Akhil.
- Yes.

1898
01:59:00,667 --> 01:59:02,806
Run. I'll teach her a lesson.

1899
01:59:02,869 --> 01:59:04,348
Take care.

1900
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:08,612
Only a woman can
understand another woman.

1901
01:59:46,546 --> 01:59:47,684
Rascals ran away.

1902
01:59:49,849 --> 01:59:51,453
Sorry! Sorry!

1903
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:56,290
Attack!

1904
02:01:12,465 --> 02:01:16,345
He's not a dog, he's my brother.

1905
02:01:16,569 --> 02:01:18,981
I've got emotions for him here.

1906
02:01:19,505 --> 02:01:24,955
And for people like you,
I've got action right here.

1907
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:26,285
Attack!

1908
02:01:36,022 --> 02:01:38,628
Brother. Brother.
My friend's life is in danger.

1909
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:39,701
We'll have to do something.

1910
02:01:39,759 --> 02:01:40,703
Do something please.

1911
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,670
Do what.

1912
02:01:43,863 --> 02:01:45,604
Yes, yes.

1913
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:49,710
Ready Steady go.

1914
02:01:55,608 --> 02:01:56,746
Go.

1915
02:01:57,009 --> 02:01:58,352
Allah!

1916
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:01,485
Chaku-Ia (hand me the knife).

1917
02:02:01,681 --> 02:02:02,887
No, Habibullah!

1918
02:02:04,517 --> 02:02:06,019
Hand me the knife!

1919
02:02:15,962 --> 02:02:17,100
Sorry!

1920
02:02:17,597 --> 02:02:20,077
Rascal. Scoundrel.

1921
02:02:20,633 --> 02:02:22,271
Were you born upside down?

1922
02:02:22,335 --> 02:02:24,042
Forgive me.

1923
02:02:24,303 --> 02:02:25,407
Last chance.

1924
02:02:40,486 --> 02:02:41,829
Sorry! Sorry!

1925
02:02:41,888 --> 02:02:45,426
Before he stabs me
with the fourth knife..

1926
02:02:45,925 --> 02:02:48,531
...please kill me God.

1927
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:50,306
Kill me.
- Sorry.

1928
02:02:50,763 --> 02:02:52,606
Kill me.
Buy a knife.

1929
02:02:52,632 --> 02:02:54,339
Buy a knife.
Knife-seller.

1930
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,674
Buy knives for cheap.

1931
02:02:55,735 --> 02:02:58,341
15 Rs. a piece.
- Habibullah!

1932
02:03:11,884 --> 02:03:14,558
Cheating. Cheating.

1933
02:04:23,789 --> 02:04:29,671
“This is the bond of love.“

1934
02:04:30,964 --> 02:04:36,778
"Its confluence of many centuries."

1935
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:39,513
Stay on the side, Entertainment.

1936
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:14,814
Akhil.

1937
02:05:33,425 --> 02:05:35,268
Entertainment!

1938
02:05:35,328 --> 02:05:36,329
Entertainment!

1939
02:05:36,395 --> 02:05:37,373
Entertainment!

1940
02:06:41,293 --> 02:06:42,294
Entertainment!

1941
02:06:42,428 --> 02:06:43,429
Entertainment!

1942
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:46,466
Akhil.

1943
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:48,738
He's still alive.

1944
02:08:48,587 --> 02:08:49,793
We've removed the bullet.

1945
02:08:49,855 --> 02:08:52,301
But I am sorry,
his heart is not responding.

1946
02:08:58,363 --> 02:08:59,603
He's fine.

1947
02:08:59,899 --> 02:09:00,969
Akhil.

1948
02:09:14,914 --> 02:09:15,892
Careful.

1949
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:20,528
Just blink and I'll understand.

1950
02:09:22,488 --> 02:09:24,263
Is it paining a lot?

1951
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:29,840
Do you know what that
crazy doctor's saying?

1952
02:09:29,895 --> 02:09:31,306
He's lost his mind.

1953
02:09:31,631 --> 02:09:32,871
He's uttering nonsense.

1954
02:09:33,299 --> 02:09:34,642
What was he saying outside?

1955
02:09:37,803 --> 02:09:38,747
Yes.

1956
02:09:38,871 --> 02:09:40,714
Your heart isn't responding.

1957
02:09:40,806 --> 02:09:41,876
You..

1958
02:09:43,609 --> 02:09:45,611
He's talking rubbish.

1959
02:09:46,378 --> 02:09:47,379
He's crazy.

1960
02:09:47,446 --> 02:09:50,893
He doesn't know that you're a fighter.

1961
02:09:51,617 --> 02:09:52,561
Right?

1962
02:09:56,622 --> 02:09:57,999
That's more like it.

1963
02:09:59,759 --> 02:10:03,468
You've to dance at my wedding as well.

1964
02:10:04,497 --> 02:10:06,272
I've to get you married as well.

1965
02:10:06,865 --> 02:10:10,813
That female dog from the jungle,
the one you ran after.

1966
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:13,580
I never saw you run so fast.

1967
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:15,414
You'll marry her, won't you?

1968
02:10:18,978 --> 02:10:20,389
That's more like it.

1969
02:10:29,488 --> 02:10:33,732
You won't leave me, will you?

1970
02:10:39,899 --> 02:10:41,344
Open your eyes!

1971
02:10:42,835 --> 02:10:43,973
Open your eyes.

1972
02:10:58,817 --> 02:11:01,423
Who do you think you are?

1973
02:11:06,491 --> 02:11:09,472
First you saved my father's life.

1974
02:11:11,263 --> 02:11:13,903
Then you saved my life so many times.

1975
02:11:16,969 --> 02:11:20,940
Do you have the right to saving lives?

1976
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:27,948
Will you show all the loyalty?

1977
02:11:29,748 --> 02:11:32,354
Can't we humans do anything for you?

1978
02:11:38,023 --> 02:11:41,937
But you're not loyal.

1979
02:11:42,795 --> 02:11:44,570
You're leaving me.

1980
02:11:46,765 --> 02:11:47,937
You're a traitor.

1981
02:11:48,467 --> 02:11:49,537
You're a traitor.

1982
02:11:49,602 --> 02:11:50,808
You're a traitor.

1983
02:12:18,631 --> 02:12:19,974
His head is responding.

1984
02:12:20,465 --> 02:12:21,500
Quick, nurse.

1985
02:12:31,477 --> 02:12:36,017
"What is loyalty and what is trust."

1986
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:40,889
“..l have learnt it from you.“

1987
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:45,663
"What is head and what is 
ove.."

1988
02:12:45,724 --> 02:12:50,366
“..l have learnt it from you.“

1989
02:12:54,366 --> 02:12:55,071
Akhil.

1990
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:05,846
He saved your life.

1991
02:13:06,745 --> 02:13:08,520
And anyone who has his love.

1992
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:11,824
..is richer than any millionaire.

1993
02:13:19,458 --> 02:13:20,869
Sir, you're absolutely right.

1994
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:23,033
No matter how hard you try..

1995
02:13:23,595 --> 02:13:26,508
..you won't find someone like him.

1996
02:13:26,832 --> 02:13:28,368
Let it be.

1997
02:13:28,433 --> 02:13:29,275
Sorry, sir.

1998
02:13:29,334 --> 02:13:30,369
You're right.

1999
02:13:32,371 --> 02:13:35,682
Akhil, didn't the police..
- Saakshi.

2000
02:13:36,575 --> 02:13:38,418
He showed his humanity again.

2001
02:13:39,010 --> 02:13:40,785
He said,
give them a chance to reform.

2002
02:13:40,846 --> 02:13:42,587
..drop all the charges against them.

2003
02:13:43,015 --> 02:13:44,756
After all we four are cousins.

2004
02:13:44,817 --> 02:13:46,888
Yes, we're all cousins.

2005
02:13:46,952 --> 02:13:47,953
I say this from my heart

2006
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,294
We're sorry.

2007
02:13:49,521 --> 02:13:51,023
Brother Akhil, I had a small doubt.

2008
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:53,799
He said we're cousins.

2009
02:13:54,059 --> 02:13:55,800
Him. From his mouth.

2010
02:13:55,894 --> 02:13:58,704
Yes, he can speak.

2011
02:13:58,864 --> 02:14:01,470
Brother in English,
'Bhai in Hindi and in Marathi.

2012
02:14:02,033 --> 02:14:03,307
See. "Bhau" (Brother)

2013
02:14:04,503 --> 02:14:06,710
What should we always have in life?

2014
02:14:06,772 --> 02:14:07,648
Bhow.

2015
02:14:07,806 --> 02:14:09,547
See. Good nature.

2016
02:14:10,543 --> 02:14:12,682
And even after everything he did..

2017
02:14:12,844 --> 02:14:14,721
..what is he not showing?

2018
02:14:14,946 --> 02:14:15,788
See.

2019
02:14:15,847 --> 02:14:17,520
He isn't showing off.

2020
02:14:18,283 --> 02:14:21,287
Now I pronounce you husband and wife.

2021
02:14:21,954 --> 02:14:23,524
And you too.

2022
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:33,340
"My brother chocolate boy."

2023
02:14:33,565 --> 02:14:35,511
"He was the women's joy."

2024
02:14:35,567 --> 02:14:39,276
"He swapped all girls
with his sweet-talks."

2025

"When he got a chance."

2027
02:14:43,342 --> 02:14:46,949
"He took away all the kisses."

2028
02:14:47,012 --> 02:14:50,755
"Your youth's come to an end."

2029
02:14:51,016 --> 02:14:54,725
“All your lovers became my friends.“

2030
02:14:54,954 --> 02:14:58,367
“Call the DJ ."

2031
02:15:02,928 --> 02:15:04,464
“Call the DJ ."

2032
02:15:04,529 --> 02:15:07,009
"It's my brother's wedding."

2033
02:15:07,065 --> 02:15:08,510
"Uncork the bottles."

2034
02:15:08,567 --> 02:15:10,740
"It's my brother's wedding."

2035
02:15:10,802 --> 02:15:13,339
"It's trending on Twitter."

2036
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:16,376
"It's trending on Twitter."

2037
02:15:16,441 --> 02:15:18,819
"It's my brother's wedding."

2038
02:15:18,877 --> 02:15:20,356
"Pending for a longtime."

2039
02:15:20,412 --> 02:15:22,824
"It's my brother's wedding."

2040
02:15:37,930 --> 02:15:41,901
"My brother asked me
the meaning of marriage."

2041
02:15:41,967 --> 02:15:45,847
“I said, rest of your life
has become a punishment.“

2042
02:15:46,505 --> 02:15:49,816
"My brother asked me
what about my independence."

2043
02:15:49,875 --> 02:15:53,618
“I said you'll face the
same plight as your daddy.“

2044
02:15:54,412 --> 02:15:57,757
“I hope no one jinxes your pair.“

"It's my brother's wedding."

2051
02:16:17,770 --> 02:16:21,445
Basanti, you won't dance
in front of these dogs.

2052
02:16:23,242 --> 02:16:24,380
Why won't she?

2053
02:16:24,443 --> 02:16:25,683
We dogs have paid for the ticket.

2054
02:16:25,744 --> 02:16:26,654
Dance!

2055
02:16:26,845 --> 02:16:27,755
Dance!

2056
02:16:27,946 --> 02:16:29,016
Dance!

2057
02:16:30,682 --> 02:16:34,653
"My brother."

“Soon our weddin recession
will come down the lane.“

2059
02:16:39,458 --> 02:16:42,769

my day will come too.“

2060
02:16:42,828 --> 02:16:47,334
"It's the season of weddings,
the priest's ready."

2061
02:16:47,365 --> 02:16:50,835
"Brother will perform the rites,
don't be so rude."

2062
02:16:50,902 --> 02:16:54,577
"The guests will be busy
doing their thing."

2063
02:16:54,873 --> 02:16:58,514
"And two dreams will fit
in a single budget."

2064
02:16:58,577 --> 02:17:02,286
"Some play the band."

2065
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:08,527
"Some play the band."

2066
02:17:08,587 --> 02:17:10,794
“I've been hooked too.“

2067
02:17:10,855 --> 02:17:12,425
"Uncork the bottles."

2068
02:17:12,491 --> 02:17:14,630
“I've been hooked too.“

2069
02:17:14,693 --> 02:17:17,071
"It's trending on Twitter."

2070
02:17:18,764 --> 02:17:20,300
"It's trending on Twitter."

2071
02:17:20,365 --> 02:17:22,606
"It's my brother's wedding."

2072
02:17:22,668 --> 02:17:24,011
"Pending for a longtime."

2073
02:17:24,269 --> 02:17:26,681
"It's my brother's wedding."

2074
02:17:41,019 --> 02:17:41,997
He's fallen.

2075
02:17:48,393 --> 02:17:49,770
Oh, the shoe hit her face.

2076
02:18:07,712 --> 02:18:09,316
Hey! Catch him.

2077
02:18:13,318 --> 02:18:14,626
They're still working on my makeup.

2078
02:18:14,886 --> 02:18:16,991
As you pay...so shall you reap.

2079
02:18:18,823 --> 02:18:22,361
“Seems like he has sliced
both sides of every capsule.“

2080
02:18:22,427 --> 02:18:23,428
What do you mean?

2081
02:18:23,495 --> 02:18:25,907
Because we don't see any side-effect.
