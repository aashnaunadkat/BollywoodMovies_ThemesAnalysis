1
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Get down.

2
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
How are you? There's a hue
and cry in every street..

3
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,400
He is a thief!

4
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,400
Good morning, sir. Good morning.
Change his dressing. Yes, sir.

5
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,440
There's a hue and
cry in every street..

6
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,840
He is a thief!

7
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Sir..

8
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm a political leader, sir!

9
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,080
These people have
trapped me in here, sir!

10
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,200
The legislative council
has started, sir!

11
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,880
They're not letting me go, sir!

12
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,080
Let go of me.. Enough!
Leave me.. Stop!

13
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
Insult to democracy!

14
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Good morning, sir.

15
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,160
Good morning..

16
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,360
Have a seat.

17
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,040
Thank you, sir. So,
you studied all the cases in three days.

18
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Fantastic. Yes, thank you, sir.

19
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,640
But sir

20
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,680
I don't understand
Bichhi's case.

21
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,840
You don't need to understand it.
What?

22
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Whatever you've understood
is enough. Okay?

23
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,080
But I'm very curious, sir.

24
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,440
People here say weird and
absurd things about him.

25
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,080
And I would really like
to try and help him.

26
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Do not let his wonder

27
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
steal your thunder

28
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,200
my dear boy.

29
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,640
Solitary confinement.

30
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
Make a note of this

31
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,240
only because you
shouldn't ever go there.

32
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Ever as in

33
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
never ever.

34
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Why is that, sir?

35
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Bichhi is trouble.

36
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,760
He'll get you into trouble.

37
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Stop!

38
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Come.

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Come.

40
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,920
Stop!

41
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,320
Stay.

42
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,360
Did you stay?

43
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
Go.

44
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Die.

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,920
In one of the stories
of 'Panchatantra'

46
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,160
a frog befriends a scorpion.

47
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,880
One day, he saw the scorpion
sitting on the river bank sadly.

48
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,520
The frog asked, 'What happened, pal?
Why do you look sad?'

49
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
The scorpion said, 'I need to
cross the river but I can't swim.'

50
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
'How do I get to the other side?'
The frog replied, 'Is that all?'

51
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
'I'll carry you across the river.
Hop on my back.'

52
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,200
The frog starts crossing the river
with the scorpion on its back.

53
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,480
But halfway through the
river, suddenly

54
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
the scorpion

55
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,720
stung the frog!

56
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,440
The dying frog asked the
scorpion, 'Why did you do that?'

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,920
'Now you, too, will drown with me!
What have you done?'

58
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,600
The scorpion said, 'Pal,
don't trust my friendship.'

59
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
'Do not trust my friendship.'

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,840
'It's my nature to sting.'

61
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,240
This.. Bichhi!

62
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,120
Bichhi is just like the
scorpion from the story.

63
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,280
Stay away from him!

64
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,320
Just stay away.

65
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
Lala said

66
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,640
that he saw Lord
Hanuman in Bichhi.

67
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,520
Fiery red face.

68
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,280
His chest was
immeasurably broad!

69
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,240
Also, Ram, Sita and Lakshmana
were visible in his open chest.

70
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,120
Lala ran to Bichhi.

71
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,360
He fell on his feet.

72
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,040
The minute Bichhi
laid his eyes on him

73
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,400
he got hypnotised.

74
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,400
He devoted his mind,
body, wealth, everything

75
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,880
to Bichhi and was
drawn towards him.

76
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
He was out of his senses.

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
After nearly three hours

78
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,280
he regained his
senses on a bridge.

79
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
There was a rich jeweller.

80
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,760
A dishonest man.

81
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,680
He used to sell impure gold.

82
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,520
He influenced him in such a way

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,280
that he ended up donating all
of his wealth to the temple.

84
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,360
People say the jeweller
later went mad.

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,480
All the officers respected him.

86
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,560
Every officer

87
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,160
bowed before him
irrespective of their ranks.

88
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,840
What form did he acquire?

89
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,040
Bichhi can take any form.

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,360
Man, woman

91
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,040
lion or cobra!

92
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,080
He made a nun a minister
using his influence.

93
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Later, she wanted to become the
prime minister with Bichhi's help.

94
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,360
She also wanted to marry him.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,120
But Bichhi ran away
after seeing her greed.

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,040
They say

97
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,840
that the lady looked for him,
found him and put him in this asylum.

98
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,600
The one you're looking for

99
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,560
is searching for you as well.
Who is it?

100
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,440
The one whom you're feeling now

101
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,000
feels you, too.

102
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,120
The one you recognise,
recognises you as well.

103
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
Don't run out of fear!

104
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Stop there!

105
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,800
Come to me.

106
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,840
You believed people's stories.

107
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,120
Bichhi wore Lord Hanuman's costume.
Did you believe that?

108
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Messed with the jeweller's head

109
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,480
and he ended up donating all
his wealth to the temple.

110
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,240
Did you believe it?

111
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,440
Turned a nun into a minister

112
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,720
and got trapped in her words.

113
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,080
You believed the cook's,
clerk's and the warden's words.

114
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,000
They said even policemen
bowed before Bichhi.

115
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,440
And the old, crazy doctor!

116
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,200
Bichhi is like the
scorpion from the story.

117
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
Did you fall for their words?

118
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,600
Shame!

119
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,120
Now, if someone tells you

120
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,440
that your Santro car was
stolen six months ago

121
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,640
and has still not been found

122
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,440
would I be responsible for
that, too?

123
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Or else

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,040
on the last 26th January,
for the last time

125
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,880
your girlfriend kissed you.

126
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,840
Am I responsible for that, too?

127
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,840
How do you know about all this?

128
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I hang out there, like a bat

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,920
from where I can see everything.

130
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,640
What do you see?

131
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,040
I, too, want to see it.

132
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,320
You are seeing it.

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,280
But to see what you want to,
you need to change your eyes.

134
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
What?

135
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,760
Hang like a bat..

136
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,160
Did you?

137
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
Look carefully.

138
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,360
You're seeing yourself
for the first time.

139
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,480
Look.

140
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Bichhi!

141
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Here's your food!

142
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
You're seeing it.

143
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,400
But to see what you want to,
you need to change your eyes.

144
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Sir, you!
Hang there like a bat..

145
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,200
Bichhi has escaped!

146
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,920
Bichhi has escaped!

147
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,760
Bichhi has escaped!

148
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,320
Look carefully.

149
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,000
'A miracle in your city!'

150
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,800
'SAAT UCHAKKEY.
With the blessings of Kalki'

151
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,240
'and the glory of herbs
from the Himalayas'

152
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
'presenting Jagdish Bikaner'

153
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,280
'who, without sleeping
and nonstop paddling'

154
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,480
'for ten days and ten nights'

155
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,480
'will showcase continuous
and uninterrupted cycling!'

156
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,840
Come on, Pappi.

157
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,440
You're impossible.

158
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,080
You took the chit worth
one lakh for Rs. 7,000!

159
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,360
People thought you'd start your
own antique sculpture business.

160
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,520
Would someone spend so much
on decorating their house?

161
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,680
Do you know?
People are killing their time

162
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,000
using your love story.

163
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
It's not your fault, buddy.

164
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,800
It's my bad time.
Undeserving people have all the money.

165
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
What do I do with this?

166
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,360
The same.. Why so?

167
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,200
He couldn't have given me
four more days, could he?

168
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,280
He asked us to do
this yesterday.

169
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,760
I refused. I said no.
There's something called humanity, right?

170
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,840
Listen, don't take me wrong.

171
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,440
The enterprise..

172
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,800
It was not built just like that.
'Himalaya Dry Cleaners'.

173
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,200
Did you understand?

174
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,840
You scoundrel!
Take the things and get lost.

175
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Did you understand?

176
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,240
I'm Lord Hanuman's devotee.

177
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,480
I won't spare him.

178
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,160
Go and tell him.

179
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,200
We used to work together.

180
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,680
Hurry up.

181
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,480
Hey, son of a gun.

182
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
It's LCD. Be careful.

183
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,040
Sit with the TV.

184
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,760
Did you hear?
Handle it with care.

185
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,360
Handle it carefully. Scoundrel..

186
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,360
What is this?
Won't you show some hospitality?

187
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,600
Such anger!

188
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Get lost.

189
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,840
Listen. You're yet to
pay six instalments.

190
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,600
If you can pay within a week

191
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,880
then,
you can take your things back.

192
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,360
Otherwise, use the chit fund.

193
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,240
I'll leave now. Greetings.

194
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
What is it?

195
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
What is it?

196
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,320
Are they playing
'MughaleAzam' here?

197
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,480
You want to see
nudity, don't you?

198
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,040
Why stop with half?

199
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,000
See the whole thing.

200
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
There. He has lost it.

201
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,520
There!

202
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,280
The planetary
positions are malefic.

203
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,440
I can see a failed relationship..
So..

204
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,560
Is there a solution?
I see a change of place as well.

205
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,400
You mean, a transfer?

206
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,080
I can see success in your
work but it will slip away

207
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
in the last minute.

208
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,040
Yes. So, is there a solution?

209
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
The planetary positions
are affecting that, too.

210
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Look at this.

211
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
You can see
everything, can't you?

212
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,840
I just saw the future.

213
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,520
Didn't you see the slap coming?

214
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,880
Didn't you? Fraudster!

215
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,600
My name is Tejpal.

216
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,400
Subinspector, Chandni Mahal.

217
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,600
I changed the future
of that place.

218
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,800
Future, birth charts, my foot!

219
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,600
What's the emergency?

220
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes, tell me.

221
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,360
You evil son of a devil!

222
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,920
You took all of our money!

223
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,280
You have intruded
into the mansion.

224
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,360
The rooms are filled
with treasure!

225
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,880
You're living
comfortably even today.

226
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,480
Old hag, you act well.

227
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,080
The bullet I fired hit the wall.

228
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,480
The next bullet I fire
will hit you in the heart.

229
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Mahinder

230
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,000
ask Ms.
Kalawati to serve her tea.

231
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,000
And then respectfully
escort her out.

232
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,200
Call that dolt!

233
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,320
Call him and tell him that
I've asked him to come here.

234
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,480
Kalawati died 25 years ago!

235
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,680
Go and die!

236
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,920
As if he owns everything!
Is everything fine?

237
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Put the scooter on the stand.
That rouge..

238
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Move.

239
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,400
He slept with the foreigners.

240
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,600
You took everything
that belonged to us!

241
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,520
He is firing his gun over there.

242
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,280
All your wealth
will rot in hell..

243
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,760
You'll rot.. What are you looking at?
You won't even..

244
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
What's happening?
...get water when you..

245
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,440
Look, sir! She's got into the house again.
She's making our lives hard.

246
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,440
We're fed up of her menace.

247
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,560
You don't have mansion's
documents either, do you?

248
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,040
Hey, old hag! Hey! Hey, lady.

249
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,760
When you die,
no one will be there for the rites..

250
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,200
Dear lady, take a breath.

251
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,160
There's no heaven for you..
You're spoiling my name, lady.

252
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,000
Someone like me..
I'll put you in the lockup.

253
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,120
You're not locking her up.

254
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,360
Who will take care of her in
the police station? Your dad?

255
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
Hey.. You wanted to sell the
mansion, right?

256
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,200
Do that.
That's the only way out.

257
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,520
God will punish you for this!

258
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,040
God will punish you for this!
Someone get him out of the '90s.

259
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
He's still firing his gun.

260
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,200
God will punish you for this!

261
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,400
Come, ma'am. You..
Stop it, lady!

262
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,040
Hey!

263
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,520
He's been in shock because of his
wife's death for the last 25 years!

264
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
He's still stuck there.

265
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,160
Your house.. Lady!
Stop shouting, lady.

266
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,720
Do you think you are a royal descendant?
She shouldn't..

267
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,560
We're stuck in this
because of you guys!

268
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,600
Give me a Dhanlaxmi ticket.
Eighth from the top.

269
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,520
Okay.

270
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,760
Three, four, five, six, seven..
That one.

271
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,200
Come on, my dear.

272
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,080
People used to use
locks in the era

273
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,800
when they used to keep
money in their homes.

274
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,800
Nowadays, the people at the
bank handle all the money.

275
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,160
So, why would people who
make locks work hard on them?

276
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Am I not right?

277
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,920
This lock is at least 90 years
old, Haggu. I see..

278
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,600
The difficulty I am facing in
fixing it speaks of its age.

279
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,360
But it's in my hands
where magic happens.

280
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Right, pal?

281
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,120
There.. Get me some tea.
A key for your lock.

282
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,880
How much do I owe you?
Come on, ma'am.

283
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,200
Why would I take money from you?

284
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,640
Just invite me home for
a cup of tea sometime.

285
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,160
I'll send the money through Bunty.
Hey..

286
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,240
I'm sure it's not more than 15.
Moron. Hey, listen to me!

287
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,360
Shameless.. Dogfaced woman..

288
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,160
No matter who it is,
everybody frowns at me!

289
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,000
Pappi,
she was starting to fall for me.

290
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,640
She batted her eyes..
Just tell me why you called me here.

291
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,520
What are you going to do about Khappe?
Do tell.

292
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,280
What is up with you?
Got up on the wrong side of the bed?

293
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,560
I need to make money.

294
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,800
Even if I have to
go to hell for that.

295
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Is that all?
Come, let's go to Khappe.

296
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,920
But till yesterday..
We'll get out of that.

297
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,680
I'll say four,
you'll hear eight.

298
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,560
In the end, we'll end up with two.
What's the point?

299
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,240
Do you want to see a magic trick?
Yes!

300
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Did you see?

301
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Do you see?

302
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,120
Go.. Wow!

303
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,280
Hey, Khappe, come here.

304
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
Yes. Where are you going?

305
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,760
Yes, go just like that, idiot.

306
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,400
Don't bother working. Come on!

307
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Stay busy with your
silly pursuits.

308
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,040
I will finish off
the work by evening.

309
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,640
Don't irritate me unnecessarily.
Hey!

310
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,560
Even if I work hard he will never
be satisfied. He is so ungrateful.

311
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
Forget it. Even you are
always busy with your tricks.

312
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,480
Yes.. Work happens on its own, right?
Tell me the plan.

313
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,560
Mr. Pappi, explain it to him.

314
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,680
He always keeps taunting
me as if he is my spouse.

315
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,760
Plan. I can't take this tension any longer.
Take us to Parda Bagh.

316
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,200
Mr. Pappi, let's listen from
the one who will help us.

317
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,680
I will say something,
you'll expect more

318
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
and you will get less than half of
what you expected. What is the use?

319
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
Hurry up.

320
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,480
One, two, three, four.
Here you go. It has come out.

321
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,160
Look at it!
It's an amazing trick.

322
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,840
We need to steal electricity.

323
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,040
Do you think the work is difficult?
I'm handling the internal matters.

324
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,640
I'll handle it.
10 to 12 shops would suffice.

325
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,040
Will we get into trouble?

326
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,440
You'll do the work, right?
Yes, it is easy.

327
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,840
We will manage not just
10 shops but 20 of them.

328
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,800
Mr. Pappi, 10 is more than
enough at the initial stage.

329
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,400
You do as per your ability.
I have no problem.

330
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,160
I can even handle 50.
What about the money?

331
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,360
It will be Rs.
2000 per party per month. Okay.

332
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,360
Rs. 1000 per party will be mine.

333
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,760
Rest you can share
as per your wish.

334
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,560
We will collect Rs. 2,500.
It will be profitable for us as well.

335
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,640
Done. I'll take your leave.
Okay?

336
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,360
Mr. Pappi, let's go and
offer prayer to Lord Hanuman.

337
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,680
We shouldn't delay it.

338
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,600
Let's start the work tonight.
Mr. Pappi, 20!

339
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,120
I am thinking of making it 30.
Think about it.

340
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,240
Come.. Run! It must be Tejpal.
Run.. Stupid, run!

341
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,600
Pappi, get down. Jump.
What are you doing there?

342
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,440
We will be caught.
He will hit us badly. Get down.

343
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,320
You climb up.. Run! Here..

344
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,480
Where?

345
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,760
Oh, my!

346
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,280
Will you get down or do
you want me to help you?

347
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,720
How much does the cauliflower cost?
Rs. 15 per kilogram.

348
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,280
Cucumber? Rs. 20.
Snake gourd? Rs. 40.

349
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,800
What about pumpkin? Rs.
100 for one kilogram.

350
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,600
Be a vegetable vendor.

351
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,880
Don't be a goldsmith.
Are you selling jewellery?

352
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,600
I will quote as it has been priced.
Why will I lie?

353
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,040
What do you mean?
Have they been quoted in America?

354
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,520
Okay, you don't give me the money.
Say something, instead.

355
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,600
Forget it. Everyone is a thief.

356
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,720
Go and file a complaint in
Rashtrapati Bhavan, Kareena Kapoor.

357
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,840
If you talk nonsense, I will shove
this bottle gourd through you.

358
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,320
You will open up. Got it?

359
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,520
Bottle guard, apple
guard, ridge guard.

360
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,560
She decks up early in the morning
and goes to buy vegetables.

361
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,440
Mr. Pappi is having a good time.
Sure, he is.

362
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,520
The devil is here.
Sona. What happened?

363
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,760
Why are you here so early
in the morning? Pappi..

364
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,520
That Pappi.. What?

365
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,720
Tejpal. What did he do?

366
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,800
Rickshaw, to police
station, Chandni Mahal.

367
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,760
Both of you get lost.

368
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,680
One day you will be in great trouble.
Trust me.

369
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,240
Come on. Let's go. Idiots.

370
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,400
If she wasn't beautiful,
I would have slapped her.

371
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,880
How can he file a complaint?
What does he think of himself?

372
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,760
You almost reached there.

373
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,320
But at the right moment you
got caught and ended up here.

374
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,200
Let Mr. Nehra call.
Just wait and watch. Call?

375
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,200
Yes.
You can call from Tihar Jail.

376
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,920
How can he send me to
Tihar without any evidence?

377
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,600
Do you think I'm a drug supplier?
Rajbeer.

378
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,080
We seized smack in Chawri
Bazar, right?

379
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,560
Take five grams out of it
and put it on his name.

380
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,440
He is irritating a lot.

381
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,480
Scoundrel. I'll use this
brick to smash my head.

382
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,480
I'll inform the human rights association.
Have you gone mad?

383
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,160
I'll bring a procession outside
your station. Have you lost it?

384
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,240
You are torturing us.
Will you put me in trouble?

385
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,000
Sir.. Get me out of here.
I'll inform human rights association.

386
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,760
Sir, he is blackmailing me.
Look at him. I'll smash my head.

387
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,320
Keep it down.
What are you doing?

388
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,440
Let me handle him.
What is this idiot up to?

389
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,800
Will you hit a policeman?
Sir, look at him. Get me out of here.

390
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,600
Hit it hard.
I want to see how strong you are.

391
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,800
Come on, hit. Come on. Come on!

392
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,080
What happened, Pappi?
What happened? Come on, do it!

393
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,560
Why did you stop? Hit yourself.

394
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,320
Won't you hit? What did he do?

395
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,640
Show me how strong you are.
Don't do it.

396
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,160
Have you gone mad? He won't do anything..
Come on, smash it!

397
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,240
Pappi, don't do anything.
What happened?

398
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,520
Let it be! Hey, coward.
Listen to me.

399
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,440
I'll send you to Tihar Jail.
He won't do anything..

400
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,320
You wait here. Come with me!

401
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,480
And you listen to me.
Sit over there.

402
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,840
You will have a tough time in Tihar.
You.. No..

403
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,480
Take him away! I'll explain him.
Sir, listen to me. Shut up!

404
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,560
Sir, come. Listen to me.
Listen to me please. Keep on blabbering.

405
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,920
What does he think of himself?
I won't spare him.

406
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
You are right.
You are absolutely right.

407
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,720
Forgive him once.
I guarantee you.

408
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,160
He won't do it again.
Dare not do it again!

409
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,000
He won't do it again.
Teju, please let him go.

410
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,200
Why are you wasting
your time on this idiot?

411
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,640
You're ignoring me.
I will.. Don't say so.

412
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,600
Look over here.
Look at your face in this.

413
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,240
You are impossible. Forget it.

414
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,600
You don't look good
when you are angry.

415
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,520
No, you don't. Sona..

416
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,240
Won't you do it for my sake?
What are you doing?

417
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,640
What am I doing? Sona..

418
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,560
Forgive him just once.
One last time.

419
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,920
Rampal, let him go.
He has been bailed out.

420
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,000
I'll get you Halwa for lunch.
Piping hot Halwa.

421
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,840
Come to my home. Bye.

422
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,200
I'll come in the afternoon
tomorrow to have Halwa.

423
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,600
Okay?

424
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,600
'10 days and 10
nights on bicycle.'

425
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,440
Get lost. Listen.
Don't come after me. First tell me.

426
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,520
Who asked you to
steal electricity?

427
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,520
Did you see the bill at the chemist shop?
Will you steal?

428
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
What do I do when the expenses
are more than my income?

429
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,400
You were about to open a shop of
antique idols. What about that?

430
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,760
You wasted the chit
funds, right?

431
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,240
Who wanted to watch
movies in LCD and VCD?

432
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,520
It was my dream.
I would have fulfilled it.

433
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,680
By exposing your assets..

434
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,200
This is too much! Listen!

435
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,440
First of all, I saved you as
I'm in love with you. And you..

436
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,080
Forget it. Go and die.

437
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,520
Hey, listen. Listen to me.

438
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,360
What happened, Bijli?
Are you having a tough time?

439
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,520
How does it matter to you?

440
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,120
'It exploded here and it
exploded there.' Hey..

441
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,320
'A bubble in many bubbles.'

442
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,560
'Millions of stars'

443
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,160
'are spread all over the sky.'

444
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,560
'Up, down, front,
back, left, right.'

445
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,480
'There is a gust
of air all around.'

446
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,600
'They discuss a secret
using certain signs.'

447
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,520
'There is a puzzle awaiting you.
Without an answer.'

448
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,800
'But the key of
luck is dangling'

449
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,640
'around everyone.'

450
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,480
'So, turn into a man.
Don't live like a blind man.'

451
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,080
'Don't be a deaf man.
Live like a man.'

452
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
'A man will only'

453
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,480
'understand my sign'

454
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,680
'and will discover
the treasure of life.'

455
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,640
'I speak only the truth.'

456
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,720
'My name is Bichhi.'

457
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,640
'A portent signifying
two tales.'

458
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,640
'Your destination is one.'

459
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,040
Bijli. What was this?

460
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,680
He is indeed a calamity!
He came here three weeks back.

461
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,240
But.. Let me see.

462
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,640
Pappi. My friend is here.
Mr. Pappi..

463
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,840
Don't talk to me. Mr. Pappi..

464
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,240
What could we do?
We would have been in jail.

465
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,760
We helped you while we were out.

466
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,040
The electric pole should
have fallen on Tejpal.

467
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,920
Forget it, Mr. Pappi.
Let's go and eat Kachoris.

468
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,280
Let's go. You will feel
better after having chillies.

469
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,440
He tortured me in the
jail the entire night.

470
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,400
It's okay.
Even we will get a chance.

471
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
Our fate will change, Mr. Pappi.

472
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,680
Let's go.. Let's eat Kachoris.

473
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,680
Give me more Chutney. It's good!
The salt is just fine..

474
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,720
This happened before two years.
He does..

475
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,520
I was digging borewell
at Mr. Diwan's house

476
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,040
along with Gurichand and his men.
Yes..

477
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,640
I had dug almost four
feet when I found a trunk.

478
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,280
Trunk? There was gold in there.
Is it?

479
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,800
What next? Nothing!
I was stunned!

480
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,440
I went to Mr. Diwan and
told him about the treasure.

481
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,320
Darn it! What happened next?
Listen to me.. Listen..

482
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Listen to me carefully..
Mr. Diwan took it..

483
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,280
You will find the treasure.
Listen to me carefully. He took it!

484
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,880
He then thrashed
me like anything!

485
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,640
Which means the treasure
is there in the mansion.

486
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,240
Did you find any snakes over there?
These Kachoris.. Snake..

487
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,560
Mr. Diwan is no less than a snake.
He is a cobra..

488
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,640
If you are done then leave.
Yes, we are leaving.

489
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
He is so haughty.
We need to teach this scoundrel a lesson.

490
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,600
Don't worry. We had to run.

491
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,880
It would have been a big problem
if we would have gotten caught.

492
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,640
Did you hear something? What?

493
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,760
Did you hear something? What?

494
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,800
Have Kachoris.

495
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,160
Did we ever pay attention to
anything while having Kachoris?

496
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,160
'Only I heard him.
Aloo Kachori.'

497
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,240
Hail Lord Hanuman.

498
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,560
'The one who will be a man'

499
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,560
'will understand my signs'

500
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,720
'and will discover
the treasure of life.'

501
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,840
Here it starts. What? Grey hair.

502
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,840
Pluck it.

503
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,080
If I keep plucking it,
you will turn bald before marriage.

504
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,320
You won't be able
to fix it then.

505
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,200
Forget it.

506
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,080
You'll get what I'm saying
once you're old and surly.

507
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,680
That I was right all along.

508
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,840
How are you, ma'am?
Where have you been?

509
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,760
I had some work to do. Is it?

510
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,600
I got a showpiece.
A bronze idol.

511
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,000
Let her be! You were supposed
to take me out for a movie?

512
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,280
You didn't even get me a kohl.
Actually, I was held up.

513
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,120
You didn't even get her clothes
from the tailor. Tell me.

514
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,080
Aren't you feeling hot?
I was feeling a bit hot.

515
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,200
Get me a fan if you're
that worried about me!

516
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,160
Okay, I'll get it tomorrow.

517
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,200
If I don't get it,
you can curse me.

518
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,640
Listen. Don't touch me.

519
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,160
What happened?
I asked you not to touch me.

520
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,840
Why won't I?

521
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,600
I don't want to talk to you.
And why is that?

522
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,280
Scoundrel, leave me.

523
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,680
Stay away from me!

524
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,920
Why shouldn't I?
I'm warning you.

525
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,080
What did I do?

526
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,840
I have become
crazy in your love.

527
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,880
Careful! The door is open.

528
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,680
Greetings, ma'am.

529
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,520
You! Yes.

530
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,200
Sona is out since long.
I don't know where she is.

531
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,360
Even I am going out.

532
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,160
She must have gone
to the parliament

533
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,520
in order to oppose inflation.

534
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,360
Poor girl.

535
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,160
I'm wasting my time for her.

536
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,800
Ma'am, you are leaving, right?
Yes.

537
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,920
Turn off the radio
before leaving.

538
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,840
Give them Rs. 700.

539
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,480
Rest will be settled
tomorrow during the match.

540
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,720
You can do it day
after tomorrow.

541
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,120
Give me the money now. Okay..

542
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,800
Give it to me. Get lost.

543
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,360
What are you staring at?
Will you make me your brotherinlaw?

544
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,520
Get lost. You wait and..
The note smells like raw meat! Hey!

545
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,120
Come. My dear friend.

546
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,520
Let's go. Khappe, look at him.

547
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,400
He is blushing.
Stop talking nonsense.

548
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,240
Tell us something.
Mr. Pappi, there is something different.

549
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,480
Mr. Diwan was a
henchman of the British.

550
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,240
He was a traitor.

551
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,360
That amnesiac lives
in this mansion!

552
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,080
Did you hear about him?
Mr. Diwan.

553
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,040
Just pull over!

554
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,000
He transferred my mansion on his name.
What's going on?

555
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,280
Nothing much. Ms.
Sakina must be creating a ruckus!

556
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,480
And he robbed our

557
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,840
royal treasure.

558
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,800
Our most priced trunk was also

559
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,600
hidden in this mansion.

560
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,280
A precious necklace..

561
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,200
Yes. A precious necklace

562
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,600
was kept on the bed

563
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,480
and was dragged
inside this palace.

564
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,600
That trunk was six feet long.

565
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,440
My precious trunk..

566
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,360
This old lady is talking
about some treasure.

567
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,760
A person who is about
to die never lies.

568
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,000
My royal treasure..

569
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,320
That old hag..

570
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,160
'Without sleeping and
nonstop paddling..'

571
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,520
'For ten days and ten nights'

572
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,520
'will be cycling
without a break.'

573
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,440
"He punctures the cycle.."

574
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,880
He will ride this cycle for 10
days and 10 nights continuously.

575
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,480
He will suffer badly.

576
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,240
If a bull is made to walk for ten
days, it will die for sure.

577
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,080
He must be having
a twin brother.

578
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,760
Shall we go? I'm sleepy.

579
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,280
Yes. Even I'm sleepy.

580
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,400
Okay. You guys leave.

581
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,400
What will you do?

582
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,080
I'm thinking about something.

583
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,240
Let us know once you are done thinking.
Let's go, Khappe.

584
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,560
Okay, bye. We'll leave.

585
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,040
Haggu. Khappe.
What are you doing?

586
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,200
Our treasure.. Hand it to me..

587
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,600
You'll discover the
treasure of life..

588
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,440
A devotee of Ram,
Lakshmana and Sita.

589
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,840
Hail Lord Hanuman..

590
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,000
Hey.

591
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Come to the garden.

592
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,600
Get Khappe along with you.
What happened?

593
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,680
Just that our fate
is going to change.

594
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,840
Hurry up, Mr. Salim.
I have to go.

595
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,600
Mr. Pappi, who told you

596
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,240
that there is a treasure
hidden in Diwan's mansion?

597
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,360
My eyes and ears
are always open.

598
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,120
I am not blind or
deaf like you guys.

599
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Look at him.

600
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,320
He is sounding like Bichhi.

601
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,720
He is not mad.
He is befooling us.

602
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,440
He is an undercover agent.
He is a spy.

603
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,160
I have decided to
plunder the treasure.

604
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,160
Robbery!

605
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,440
By hook or by crook!

606
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,400
Look at this.

607
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,160
This is the mansion
and we are here.

608
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,040
And here is Tejpal,
our biggest trouble!

609
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,080
We will somehow
rob the treasure.

610
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,160
But he'll suspect me for sure!

611
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,360
And then he would suspect us.

612
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,520
Which means that we
can't do anything

613
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,880
till he is alive.

614
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,440
What? Murder.

615
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,680
Don't be scared.

616
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,160
What do you want us to do?

617
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,600
Don't leave me in between.

618
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,920
Useless chap!

619
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,920
Pappi, this is a great idea.

620
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,120
You have made an amazing plan.

621
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
At least we will
get rid of Tejpal.

622
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,680
Now think of a person who
will help us execute the plan.

623
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,160
Middleman.

624
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,880
Babbe Tashri. Trust me.

625
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,120
Yes! Look at the craftsmanship.

626
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,760
Look at the engineering.

627
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,920
This is a special God
of South Indians, ma'am.

628
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,080
This glows at night and spreads
a sweet fragrance in the air.

629
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
It is a powerful
symbol of Lord Bhima.

630
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,880
Do you know Lord Bhima?
Powerful.

631
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,440
Only for Rs. 300.

632
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,520
There is a discount today.
Don't ignore it. Let's buy.

633
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
God made me and sent
me here on Earth.

634
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,360
I'm here for you
and this is for you.

635
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,720
See. Keep this. Thanks..
Thank you, sir.

636
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,840
Sir, do you want some hash?

637
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,280
No, thank you.
Opium, ecstasy, manali cream.

638
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,200
You just name it.
I'll give it to you.

639
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,360
No.. No.. The guide.. No..

640
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,640
I'll offer you a good rate for it.
Let's go.

641
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,720
Massage? No..

642
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,280
Listen, ma'am. Sir.

643
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,200
Ma'am. Okay.
Do come to India again.

644
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,760
Even teach us English.

645
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,600
You change turns
as you see people.

646
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,840
Come, Mr. Pappi.

647
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,560
How did you remember me today?

648
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,160
This is dangerous, Mr. Pappi.

649
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,600
How much will you pay me?

650
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,800
Rs. 50,000.

651
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,240
But the problem is
of getting arrested.

652
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,600
You only have to trick him!
Why are you creating a scene?

653
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,360
It's a matter of hardly 20 days.

654
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,000
You don't have to spend
your life in jail.

655
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,760
Life has become a hell.

656
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,280
Why? What happened?

657
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,040
My father is suffering
from Jaundice.

658
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,360
I need to take him to
doctor every alternate day.

659
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,840
If I take it easy

660
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,760
he will be dead.

661
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,280
Making excuses in
order to skip the task!

662
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,360
Let's go, Khappe.

663
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,600
You keep selling the snakes.

664
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,720
You are embarrassing me.
Pappi. Listen to me.

665
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,160
I can get your work done.
Who is it?

666
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,760
Ajji Phodu.

667
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,080
Show me your strength now..

668
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,360
Show me your strength now.
Come on..

669
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,400
You had an affair with her!
Tell me!

670
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,120
Sister. Sister!

671
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,480
You had an affair with her and
now you are calling her sister!

672
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,880
I made a mistake.
I'll thrash you like anything!

673
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,240
Sir.

674
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,600
What happened?

675
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,600
Give me the kite.
Give me the kite!

676
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,240
Read this.

677
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,920
'Kill me with your eyes.'

678
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,240
'Don't punish me like this.
Ghalib.' Really!

679
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,320
'I love you.'

680
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,680
I love you..

681
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,360
Don't you dare come here..
Get lost. Move!

682
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,280
What is it? Where is the money?

683
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,320
Didn't your parents tell
you not to tease girls?

684
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,600
Didn't they explain it to you?
They did.

685
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,000
Get lost. My money..
This money is for beating you up.

686
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,640
My money.. Here you go.

687
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,840
Get lost! You earned this.

688
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,520
Keep this. Your reward! Take it!

689
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,080
Who will get the pistol?

690
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,600
That is my job.
Don't worry about it.

691
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,320
Mr. Pappi.
Do you know to get out of it?

692
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,240
Else I'll will get into jail.

693
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,800
Hey,
Mr. Pappi is very good at it.

694
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,520
And he learnt all
this in the jail.

695
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,880
Pappi, I have dealt the cards.
Show it to me.

696
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,520
I can't help you.

697
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,000
What is it?

698
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,600
Did you forget? What?
Agree to it..

699
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,200
Excelsior Cinema.

700
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,600
One minute.. You forgot, right?

701
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,040
I'm leaving. Don't irritate me.

702
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,440
Wait for me. I'm coming.
Will you run my household?

703
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,080
Actually,
my sister is about to get married.

704
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,800
Don't involve me into all this.

705
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,120
I have dealt the cards.

706
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,200
Shall I show you how
to deal the cards?

707
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,440
Mr. Pappi,
why are you being angry?

708
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,600
You want to get the work
done, right?

709
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,400
I'll get it done.
Who will do it?

710
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,120
Jaggi Tircha.
He is very good at it.

711
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,560
No one will be in trouble.

712
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,800
Ms. Savita.

713
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,320
The thing is

714
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,240
you need to do all this
while dealing in real estate.

715
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,640
I have been telling you, Anil.

716
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,560
File a complaint against your brother.
Your life is in danger.

717
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,520
Did you get my point?

718
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,000
He will the stab you.
Come here. Stab!

719
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,040
He will do it with ease.
A mere scratch would be there.

720
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,080
What do you say? Isn't it?

721
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,200
Ma'am, listen to me.

722
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,640
Tear off your blouse a little.

723
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,000
And then create a scene.

724
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,640
I know an inspector.

725
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,440
He will come and
recover the knife.

726
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,560
He will give a statement

727
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,360
that your brother
asked him to stab you.

728
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,920
Isn't it? Yes.

729
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,840
Mr. Jaggi,
he is not able to stand properly.

730
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,920
If he goofs up

731
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,440
then I'll be in trouble!

732
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,920
You are doubting me

733
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,760
in front of everyone.

734
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,200
Ma'am, tell me one thing.

735
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,640
I advised you to
steal Pappi's stuff.

736
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,160
It did benefit you, right?

737
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Right!

738
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,480
Okay, Mr. Jaggi.

739
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,040
How badly should
I tear the blouse?

740
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,360
Expose a bit.
That's enough. Mr. Jaggi.

741
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,440
Take your time.

742
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,680
Have some tea.
Mr. Jaggi, come here.

743
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,840
I'll be back.
You need to pay me Rs. 2,000.

744
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,480
If you don't get it done,
then I'll pay you Rs. 3,000.

745
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,160
Rest is up to you.
Come here. Okay?

746
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,480
Jaggi.

747
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,240
You are so filmy.
What do you want me to do?

748
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,080
You can do it easily.

749
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,920
Agree to it, Jaggi.
I will do it.

750
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,680
But let me meet Pappi first.
In person.

751
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,720
The matter is between us, right?
Yes, true.

752
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,320
When do you want to meet him?
Tell me.

753
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,480
Let's meet in the evening.

754
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,840
Done. Let's meet in the evening.

755
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,680
Done. Done.
Let's meet in the evening.

756
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,600
Someone should ask me, as well.

757
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,840
Fine, I'm okay with it. Good.

758
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,800
Let's meet in the evening.

759
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,680
Don't delay. Listen to me.

760
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,080
I got your work done.
Get my reward.

761
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,440
Of course. Get me two.

762
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,560
Rickshaw. Ajji. Yes.

763
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,080
I will get the work done.

764
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,560
But what is the actual matter?

765
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,800
Will you come with us?

766
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,880
We will require you. Trust me.

767
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,640
Let my meeting get fixed
with the middleman.

768
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,560
Got it?

769
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,200
Did you include me
in your business?

770
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,800
Even you will have
to do something

771
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,080
in order to get married, right?

772
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,560
I'm not scared of
doing anything.

773
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,040
I'm worried about your plan.

774
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,280
Don't try to act smart.

775
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,760
I took care of the expenses
like this my entire life.

776
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,160
Let's go.

777
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,080
Yes. Tell me, Khappe.

778
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,560
'The meeting is fixed
with Jaggi.' Introduce me.

779
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,320
With whom? 'Jaggi.' Ms. Sakina.

780
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,720
'He wants to meet you
at 7 in the evening.'

781
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,240
Okay. I'll be there. Who is it?

782
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,600
'At 7.' Message me the address.

783
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,440
Who was it? My father.
He is dead.

784
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,120
He is asking for a feast.
Organise it.

785
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,760
Hey! Sorry.

786
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,480
I have a meeting with the middleman.
Will you come?

787
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,560
Okay. You are impossible.

788
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,400
You mean to say that I
need to be the middleman.

789
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,080
Yes, I have to do
something with your help.

790
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,480
Just think

791
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,520
that we need to
fool the government.

792
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,200
Government! I meant the police.

793
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,920
Whatever it is

794
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,280
just tell me,
what I am supposed to do.

795
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,480
You need to shoot me on
the bridge of Yamuna.

796
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,600
But it will be staged.

797
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,160
Only the two of us will be there.
That's it.

798
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,920
Tejpal takes rounds at 10 p.m.

799
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,360
He will come to us
from the bridge.

800
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,920
You shoot me near my
neck after cursing me.

801
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,120
I will jump into the river.

802
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,160
You stay there so that Tejpal
can arrest you right there.

803
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,560
That's it? Yes. What else?

804
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,840
He will ask, 'Whom did you
shoot?' Tell him that you shot me!

805
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,520
I'll do it.

806
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,560
But have you ever
jumped into the river?

807
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,480
I mean be sure about it.

808
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,600
What if you fall into the
sand instead of water?

809
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,400
You concentrate on the target.
Okay.

810
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,080
Listen to me.

811
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,400
Shoot in the air.
A foot away after cursing you.

812
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,040
Don't mention my mother
while cursing. Sorry.

813
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,640
Here is Rs. 10,000.

814
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,440
I will pay rest of the
amount once the work is done.

815
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,880
Okay. Okay, sir.

816
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,680
You can count it. No, it's okay.

817
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,240
What happened?

818
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,360
I got all of his things yesterday.
Yes.

819
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,320
Where did he get
this money from?

820
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,400
Move aside.

821
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,400
What is this Pappi
up to these days?

822
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,160
What else?
He is embarrassing everyone.

823
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,240
I heard that he was
planning to get married.

824
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,840
He was asking for money.

825
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,280
What for?

826
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,200
He wants to open a shop.

827
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,200
He is thinking about getting
married to his girlfriend.

828
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,400
He is just being
excited for no reason.

829
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,280
I'll take care of his wife
once Pappi calms down.

830
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,440
This is Pappi's shoe, right?
Yes.

831
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,920
Tell him that I have taken it.

832
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,400
Let him pay me the money.

833
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,640
Then I won't even
look at his face.

834
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,720
Sir, he wants to buy your shop
and you have no idea about it.

835
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,200
You keep worrying
about the money.

836
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,520
Yes.

837
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,520
What is the plan?
I'm not able to understand.

838
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,120
It's so huge.
Such big house for a family!

839
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,080
What could be there
behind that door?

840
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,560
Over there? Yes.

841
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,880
It must be the kitchen.
There is no kitchen in there.

842
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,800
A washroom, maybe. No.

843
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,040
In that case,
why would there be glass.

844
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,920
I'm telling you.
They have huge washrooms.

845
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,320
It's a kitchen.
They put glasses. Hey.

846
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,920
What is happening? What is this?

847
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,240
What are you doing here?
What should I do?

848
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,520
We were going to
have 'Chaat Papdi'.

849
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,760
Can't I visit the market?

850
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,520
We are going to have 'Chaat Papdi'.
You can join us.

851
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,680
It will be fun.

852
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,240
You stop inviting me.

853
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,360
You had called me for lunch.
Yes.

854
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,440
I was making Halwa when I realised
that there were no raisins.

855
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,760
I left for the
market to get raisins

856
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,880
and you came when
I was not there.

857
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,680
Let all that be!

858
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,480
Teju.. Look at me.

859
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,720
What should I look at? What?

860
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,720
Look at this..

861
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,240
I was coming to police
station from here.

862
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,920
Look at this.
I made this for you.

863
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,600
Is this for me?

864
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,360
I won't spare him.
I just can't stand him.

865
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,280
Let's go.

866
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,080
And looking at her! Shut up!

867
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,760
I will change my name if I
don't teach you a lesson.

868
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,160
Jaggi. 'Who is this?'

869
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,360
Pappi speaking. 'Mr. Pappi.'

870
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,880
Tonight at 10.

871
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,360
What is the plan? Tell me.

872
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,880
I won't tell anyone.

873
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,360
It's nothing. Just like that.

874
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,680
Is it? Yes.

875
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,920
Don't tell anyone. No..

876
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,080
Keep it to yourself. Of course.

877
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,160
I want to get my death certificate.
What! Death certificate?

878
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,320
I want to claim the
insurance amount.

879
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,600
Okay. Okay..

880
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,920
Did you get my shoes? Yes..

881
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,800
When will the program start?

882
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,600
It's stinking.

883
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,520
It is a corpse.
It is not a flower.

884
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,240
I told you to get some ice.

885
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,640
We have to make it wear Pappi's
shoes and clothes as well.

886
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,160
This is delicious.
Where did you get it from?

887
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,120
This is from Khallu's shop.

888
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,240
Oh, no! Which day is today?

889
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,400
Monday. Stop it.

890
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,080
You have stopped visiting
Lord Hanuman these days.

891
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,360
No.. I have started
praying to Goddess Kali.

892
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,840
Every Friday in Neel Katra.

893
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,040
Why so?
My life was all messed up.

894
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,640
Tejpal is quite punctual.

895
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,320
Why didn't he come yet?

896
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,400
What if he doesn't come?

897
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,560
What is the insurance
amount that you will claim?

898
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,600
Nothing much. It's Rs. 2 lakhs.

899
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,320
Rs. 2 lakhs.

900
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,560
He is here. Be prepared.

901
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,480
Tell me one thing.

902
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,400
You are spending Rs.
50,000 in order to get Rs. 2 lakhs.

903
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,360
You could have
come to the court.

904
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,120
I would have got the death
certificate for Rs. 1,000.

905
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,120
You do your job. No.

906
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,160
What happened?
Why are you changing your mind?

907
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,800
Tell me. What are you up to?
Hey..

908
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,840
Do you think you
can save yourself?

909
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,120
I have spent my
life at the court.

910
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,360
I have many friends in
the police department.

911
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,760
We have to take this
corpse to Okhla.

912
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,120
I'll ruin your plan.
Tell me what you're up to.

913
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,480
Hey.. Tell me.

914
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,120
Tell me.
Jaggi, I won't spare you.

915
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,360
Will you tell me or not?
Jaggi, I'll fix you later.

916
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,920
Tell me.

917
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,640
My plan is to rob Mr. Diwan's mansion.
Scoundrel!

918
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,280
What are you going to
rob, scoundrel?

919
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,120
He killed me!

920
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,520
Let's go.. Come on.

921
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,920
Let's go! Move..

922
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,920
Pappi!

923
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,360
He killed Pappi!

924
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,040
Oh, Lord! What happened?
Who killed him? Who was he?

925
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,240
I don't know who he was.
But he killed Pappi.

926
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,720
What do you mean?

927
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,240
I don't know who he was.

928
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,120
Who is it? They killed my Pappi.

929
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,360
Did you see the
one who just ran?

930
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,640
Oh, Lord! I didn't see.

931
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,840
Pappi! Sona.

932
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,200
Pappi! Sona..

933
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,560
Sona. Shut up.. Shut up.

934
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,880
Sona.. Oh, Lord!

935
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,800
He left me alone.
Did you see Pappi dying?

936
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,680
Yes.

937
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,320
Don't cry, Sona. I'm here.

938
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,360
This is such a misery!
I'll take care of anything.

939
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,600
Oh, Lord! What have you done?

940
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,640
Did Pappi fight with anyone?

941
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,880
Good that he is dead.

942
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,880
Stop..

943
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,360
You are being angry as
if I shot him for real.

944
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,400
Stop the tantrums.

945
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,560
Why did you have to
be so good at it?

946
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,800
You just wanted to
know about the plan!

947
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,920
You could have asked
about it later.

948
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,520
Do you think that scoundrel
would have told me?

949
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,800
Everything can be done with
love, Jaggi.

950
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,360
Trust me. That was the only point
when he'd have told me the truth.

951
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,120
Why?

952
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,800
You could have shot Pappi

953
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,240
and asked him for the
plan after two days.

954
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,120
'Tell me the plan.'

955
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,360
'Else I will tell the
truth to Tejpal.' Yes.

956
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,240
You are a lawyer.
Didn't you think about it?

957
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,680
What do you think of yourself?

958
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,840
Darn it!

959
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,440
Sir.

960
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,360
We got the corpse
from the fisherman.

961
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,240
Jaggi. Corpse?

962
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,600
The one which was shot!
We will tell you.

963
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,120
You were at it, so,
we didn't use our brains. Got it?

964
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,040
Jaggi!

965
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,840
Jaggi, stay there. Mr. Pappi.

966
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,800
One minute, Mr. Pappi.
No one spoiled the plan. Wait..

967
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,200
One minute. Wait a minute..

968
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,480
Wait a minute.. Tejpal..

969
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,160
He will come. He will come.

970
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,080
Your work won't stop.

971
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,440
You idiot! Mr. Pappi..

972
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,040
I am not doing anything!
We got a corpse on your name.

973
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,920
Consider yourself to be dead.

974
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,080
They will find a
corpse in few days.

975
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,480
Jaggi, we need to handle him.

976
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,200
Look at this. I'm not doing anything.
Have a look.

977
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,160
Get lost. Come here.

978
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,600
He is here, Mr. Pappi.
He is here.

979
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,920
Didn't you do anything?

980
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,280
Now, we have to take care of
them, as well.

981
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,080
Shut up.

982
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,440
Okay, fine.

983
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,920
Even we did a mistake.

984
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,880
I am not mad. Get it?

985
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,440
Listen to me once.

986
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,520
Listen to me.

987
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,600
Haggu, calm down.
What do you mean? Listen to me.

988
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,640
You made your own
plan and we made ours.

989
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,400
Now, let's stop the fight.

990
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,040
Did you get my point?
It's of no use!

991
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,400
Listen to me and let it go.

992
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,760
Forget it, Pappi. Let it be.

993
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,920
Okay.. Forget it.
It must be God's plan.

994
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,640
It is better that seven
of us are there now.

995
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,560
Now the work will
be even easier.

996
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,360
Isn't it?
Seven is the lucky number.

997
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,880
Mr. Jaggi, Mr. Pappi.
Come on, hug it out.

998
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,240
I'm explaining you since long.

999
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,560
Let's all share it.

1000
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,680
Then you can kill me. Have it.

1001
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,480
Listen to me. Hug each other.

1002
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,840
We'll think about it later.

1003
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,840
Hug each other. Hug Mr. Pappi.

1004
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,360
Be in your limits.

1005
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:34,480
The moment you come up with a plan,
I will change the entire game.

1006
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,920
I am sorted!

1007
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,920
Let's be underground
for some time.

1008
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,880
Let Tejpal calm down.

1009
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,160
Pal, don't you worry.

1010
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,640
He ruined my mood.

1011
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,360
We'll take care of him.
I'll hit him black and blue.

1012
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,840
Jaggi's future is in our hands.
He can't harm us.

1013
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,400
You don't worry.
We'll only kill him.

1014
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,640
He can't harm us.
I won't spare him. Let it be!

1015
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,440
Hey, listen.
Tell me something. What?

1016
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,840
You are always with
the goldsmiths.

1017
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,160
How much would a gold coin cost?
Around Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 15,000.

1018
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,120
Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 15,000! Oh!

1019
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,080
You..

1020
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,320
What is it, sir?
Yesterday night, where were you both?

1021
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
Sir, we were partying.

1022
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,520
In the Ram Leela ground.

1023
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,480
When our friend got killed.

1024
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,880
Had we known about the attack

1025
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,800
we wouldn't have left him alone.

1026
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,760
He asked us to come
along, but we didn't go.

1027
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,840
It's a sin.
I'll be the one committing a sin

1028
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,880
for listening to such idiots.

1029
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,200
AAre you suspecting us?

1030
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,760
The guy on the cycle was wearing
a red coloured shirt. Yes.

1031
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,160
And around 10:00 p.m.
even the power was out.

1032
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,880
You may confirm it.

1033
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,400
I swear on you.

1034
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,920
Leave.

1035
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:02,840
Thank you.

1036
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,920
Hey, listen!

1037
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,040
Stay away from Sona. You, too.

1038
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,200
Kickstart the engine.

1039
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,880
Give it a push!

1040
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,600
Okay! Put in all your energy.

1041
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,680
He sold all his
mother's jewellery!

1042
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,240
He killed his father by giving
him rat poison. He molested me.

1043
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,600
He is threatening to kill us.
Look!

1044
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,640
Look at what he has done.
He is threatening us.

1045
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,920
Come on, hit me.
He assaulted me. Go ahead..

1046
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,560
Have you lost your mind?

1047
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,920
Come on, kill me. No..

1048
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,240
Why are you tearing it so much?

1049
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,200
Call for help.

1050
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,160
You Jaggi's sidekick.

1051
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,160
What are you doing, Inspector?

1052
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,120
He tore my wife's blouse.
Look at what he has done.

1053
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,880
Inspector,
look what he has done!

1054
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,120
He hit him. They have no shame.
Why did you hit me?

1055
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,680
Hit him!

1056
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,040
Tell me.

1057
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:51,800
Darn you!

1058
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,040
Come on, note it down.

1059
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,040
I'm not scared of the police.

1060
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,440
Sir.. Please forgive me.

1061
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,160
I got influenced by him.

1062
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,640
I'll talk to your lawyer as
well, there's nothing to worry.

1063
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,680
Stand straight.

1064
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,560
What do you say?

1065
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,200
Do you have any suggestions?

1066
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,840
Sir, you are a genius..

1067
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,840
When did you get to
know about Pappi?

1068
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,760
Pappi!

1069
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,200
The one from Gali Dilsukh Rai!

1070
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,440
Yes,
the one from Gali Dilsukh Rai.

1071
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,720
Pappi!

1072
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,600
He was a very good man.

1073
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,560
When the incident took place

1074
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,360
where were you, dear?

1075
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,120
I was playing poker with
Tinni at Asaram's place.

1076
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,200
There were four of us. Ask him.

1077
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,080
Right? Yes, tell him.

1078
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,440
Yes..

1079
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,200
It's good that you accepted that
you were involved in gambling.

1080
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,240
When did I accept?
That's what I heard!

1081
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,640
Tell me! Sir, I was..
Greetings, sir.

1082
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,560
Mr. Sherawat, I was telling you
what happened the other day, right?

1083
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,520
Take your seat.. He..

1084
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:08,920
Shut up!

1085
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,880
Listen, Tejpal!
I'll take care of all this.

1086
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,440
What about Pappi's murder case?

1087
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,160
If you want to
stop your transfer

1088
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,080
then you'll have to solve
Pappi's murder case.

1089
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,640
And the issues related
to landgrabbing

1090
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,920
let them go.
That's what I have been telling him.

1091
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,440
Okay! Just shut up.

1092
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,560
Are you leaving? You..

1093
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,600
What have you done?

1094
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,640
You tore the woman's blouse!

1095
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,840
He didn't even wait for me.

1096
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,880
He accepts bribe from a molester?
Sir!

1097
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,520
Who are you? A middleman. Sir!

1098
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,560
How dare he misguide me!
In the hospital..

1099
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,520
No one is eager to solve
Pappi's murder case!

1100
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,920
Sir, in Lala Bishan hospital

1101
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,520
a month ago,
two ambulances were auctioned.

1102
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,800
Out of those,
one is a Maruti van.

1103
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,120
Who conducted the auctioning?
Sir, it's difficult to find that.

1104
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,720
I'll have to enquire
with the administerer.

1105
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,280
But they are saying that they
don't have the documents.

1106
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,840
Should I do your work as well?

1107
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,760
Sorry, sir!

1108
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,560
Mom!

1109
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,680
"The festivities.."

1110
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,480
"The celebrations.."

1111
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,080
Pass me the matches.

1112
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,680
Take it. Light it.

1113
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,240
Light it.

1114
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,240
That guy is very powerful!

1115
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,760
It's because of the herbs.

1116
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,920
'This matter
concerns the heart.'

1117
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,920
'Like smoke,
it vanishes in thin air.'

1118
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,440
Where are you from? Lucknow.

1119
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,800
Anyway,
your house is near to Muzalabad?

1120
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,200
Yes!

1121
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,920
It's a nice bag.

1122
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:02,080
Give it to me. Sharing is good.

1123
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,640
Take this cigar.

1124
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,080
Hail the Majesty!

1125
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,800
Sir.. Listen to me. Monster!

1126
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,200
'The herd of devils.'

1127
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,440
'The cruelty of monsters.'

1128
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,360
Be careful!

1129
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,040
Beware of this cruel world. Run!
Run, idiot! Okay. You, too.

1130
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,200
Run. In black robes

1131
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,040
they are coming. The devils!
Imps. Listen to me.

1132
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,080
Blind..
Tell me what will happen next.

1133
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,920
Oh, sage.. What's this ruckus?

1134
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:34,920
Who the hell are you! Oh!

1135
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,400
Sir, that..
The sage is getting upset.

1136
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,280
Can't you understand?
Shall I make you and that sage

1137
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,440
understand?

1138
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,920
Don't make the sage curse you.

1139
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,280
What happened?

1140
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,760
Get lost.

1141
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,800
That's all right.

1142
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,280
May God shower you with happiness.
Hey! Yes.

1143
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,840
Why are you coming closer?
Are you going to kiss me?

1144
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,840
What?

1145
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,920
Pappi.. Pap..

1146
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,440
Pappi.

1147
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,320
Get lost! Okay.

1148
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,720
Insane guy!

1149
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,880
Who could be Pappi's murderer?

1150
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,680
Pappi!

1151
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,880
Killed him!

1152
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,520
Killed him! He killed my Pappi.

1153
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,280
Pappi's soul will be very happy.

1154
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,520
Lets' go, Jigru. Get going.

1155
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,720
Come on, idiot!
Hey, Mr. Kishan Chand.

1156
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,640
It's Pappi's funeral.

1157
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,360
It's a good deed.
God will bless you.

1158
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,840
Come on. Contribute a lot.
Here. Put some money.

1159
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,200
What did you do..

1160
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,880
Why are you giving only Rs. 10?

1161
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,760
At least, give Rs. 50.
After all, you own a big shop.

1162
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,840
I know that if I give you more,
you will spend it on liquor.

1163
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,320
Funeral won't happen then.

1164
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,440
The money is already
into the box!

1165
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,200
Otherwise,
I would have given it back.

1166
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,920
Rs. 10 is nothing nowadays.

1167
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,560
Let's go. Bye.

1168
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,480
Dear, where is you dad? He is..

1169
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,640
Call him.

1170
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,240
Where are you, Mr. Sharma? Dad..

1171
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,200
That mister from
Red Fort is here.

1172
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,520
Life is unpredictable!

1173
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,560
I lost my man.

1174
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,920
The sound of the gunshot is
still echoing in my ears.

1175
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,720
Where were you when
the bullet was fired?

1176
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,880
I wanted to take a leak.

1177
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,400
So, I went towards the corner.

1178
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,480
Meanwhile, I heard the gunshot.

1179
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,640
So, I started
running towards him.

1180
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,040
Did you not see the murderer?

1181
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,200
How did he look..

1182
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,440
He escaped right
in front of you.

1183
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,600
I'm already upset.

1184
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,280
Why are you trying to
augment it further?

1185
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,320
I didn't mean that, my dear.

1186
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,320
I didn't mean to say that.

1187
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,840
I'll solve all your problems.
All right?

1188
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,240
Just get over Pappi.

1189
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,440
This is irresistible!
Mom is here!

1190
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,400
What else do you want?
I want to marry her.

1191
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,080
Give Rs. 100 as a token.
I'll take care of the other expenses.

1192
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,080
My parents are no more.

1193
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,840
So, I am seeking your
permission to marry her.

1194
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,080
Take this.

1195
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,160
The girl is yours.

1196
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,840
Fix the date for the marriage.

1197
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,160
And get her out of
this wretched place.

1198
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,240
Sona.

1199
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,920
I'll leave, all right?

1200
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,320
No matter how bad Pappi was

1201
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,160
but he used to say

1202
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:18,920
even after marriage

1203
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,320
I would stay with them.

1204
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,680
All right. I'll take your leave.

1205
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,240
Greetings.

1206
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,320
Mr. Pappi was very cheerful

1207
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,880
and warmhearted.

1208
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,560
It was only because of
Mr. Pappi that we celebrated

1209
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,760
Republic Day and Independence
Day across the street.

1210
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,040
During the auspicious day of fasting..
Move aside.

1211
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,640
he used to stand under the tree

1212
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,360
and used to
distribute offertory.

1213
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,800
During any religious meets

1214
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,600
he used to do all
the arrangements..

1215
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,080
All by himself.

1216
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,160
He has never treated
anyone like an outsider.

1217
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,440
He treated everyone equally.
No, dear..

1218
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,360
Mr. Pappi.. Get lost!
What happened?

1219
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,480
Hold this. Mr. Pappi..

1220
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,400
What a man he was!

1221
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,600
Just like a king.. Like a tiger.

1222
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,520
He could make a cheetah
beg for its life.

1223
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:45,920
He was that brave.

1224
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,440
One day he gave me this CD.

1225
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,080
We were just sitting together.

1226
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:59,800
He said if I was ever
depressed in life

1227
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,600
I should play this
CD and dance to it.

1228
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,120
I agreed to it.

1229
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,480
Mr. Pappi

1230
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,600
Your demise makes me very sad.
A guy died!

1231
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,040
I cannot even cry.

1232
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,800
My heart is weeping.

1233
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,760
But we would dance.

1234
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,600
We would dance for Mr. Pappi.

1235
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,080
We would dance for his soul.

1236
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,320
Play it. Play it.

1237
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,440
"Alcohol at birth.
Alcohol at death."

1238
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,320
"Alcohol at marriage.
Alcohol at divorce."

1239
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:52,280
"No matter what brand it
is but it has to be there."

1240
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,800
"No matter what brand it
is but it has to be there."

1241
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,560
"Don't mix it with soda or
water, just have it neat."

1242
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,320
"Don't mix it with soda or
water, just have it neat."

1243
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,800
"Just take a neat shot and
forget all your troubles."

1244
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,200
"Just take a neat shot and
forget all your troubles."

1245
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,680
"Make it to four pegs."

1246
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,800
"Just take a neat shot and
forget all your troubles."

1247
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,760
"No soda, no water.."

1248
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,600
"Just take a neat shot and
forget all your troubles."

1249
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:36,360
"No soda, no water.."

1250
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,760
Hail Lord Bajrangbali..

1251
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,360
Hail Lord Bajrangbali..

1252
01:14:58,920 --> 01:14:59,800
Pappi.

1253
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,360
Pappi,
you know how much I missed you.

1254
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,440
Just think about my situation.

1255
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,240
I have half an hour.
Whatever you want to do

1256
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,920
do it fast. Really?

1257
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,760
Oh, my dear..

1258
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,840
My lips are getting burnt
because of your sweat.

1259
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,720
Did you walk till here?

1260
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,200
An alliance has
been sent for me.

1261
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,360
So!
What difference does it make?

1262
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,560
It is from Tejpal.

1263
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,600
He came up with the alliance.

1264
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,280
What did your mother say?
Mom agreed to it.

1265
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,400
Really?

1266
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,920
Do heck with your mom!
How is she at fault?

1267
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,720
Why are you always after her?

1268
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,840
For her, you are already dead.

1269
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,520
She will sell you.
She will get you married.

1270
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,800
That, too, with Tejpal.

1271
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,280
Yes, she will get me
married to Tejpal.

1272
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,560
That, too, within a month.

1273
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,600
He has already gifted
a gold chain to mom.

1274
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,360
Have you ever gifted me a ring?

1275
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,320
You just bring copper idols.

1276
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,080
Now, you don't like copper
idols but Tejpal's gold ring.

1277
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,040
Cheap people.
So, will she get you married?

1278
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,120
Yes, she will.
Do heck with you and your mother!

1279
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,160
You all just want money.
Even if she has to sell you for that!

1280
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,120
Then, why don't you start earning?
Yes, I will.

1281
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,800
You just wait. Wait there.

1282
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,680
Now see,
I shall bring the treasure.

1283
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,800
I'll get you the treasure.
I'll get it for you, anyhow.

1284
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,440
Haggu, get everyone working.
'Yes, tell me.'

1285
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,760
I'll enter the mansion alone.

1286
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,760
'What happened, Pappi?'

1287
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,920
None of your business.
Just do as I say.

1288
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,440
Don't just keep talking.

1289
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,520
Hey! Sorry.

1290
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,920
I'm in love with you.

1291
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,320
I'm sorry, dear.

1292
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,160
Police. Police is there. Run!

1293
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,360
Police. Police has come.
Run! Make is fast.

1294
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,520
What is it? It is an ambulance.

1295
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,920
Hey! We will enter
through this door.

1296
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:12,880
Superb.

1297
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,880
Nobody is getting caught.
All of them are seasoned.

1298
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,440
Sir, how will you find
the auction papers

1299
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,560
dated 3 months back?

1300
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,560
I need all the lottery records
for the last three months.

1301
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,640
Without any fail,
by today evening.

1302
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,400
I sold this to a
dealer from Mayapuri.

1303
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,640
Do you have any address?

1304
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,360
Sir.. Ambulance. There it is.

1305
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,400
So, how was it? Wonderful, mate.

1306
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,600
I see.

1307
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,640
It just heats up
and breaks down.

1308
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,640
All right. Press the clutch.

1309
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,640
Yes, sir. Buy it.
It is a beautiful one.

1310
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,600
What happened?
Where was this vehicle

1311
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,520
on the night of 3rd?

1312
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,320
Hey, mister, what are you doing?
Sir, look at him.

1313
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,560
Leave him alone.
Are you his boss?

1314
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,200
Yes. See this. Did you see?

1315
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,720
Where was the ambulance
on the night of 3rd?

1316
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
On 3rd?
Hey, get me the register.

1317
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,320
Okay.. Be quick.

1318
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,480
Give it here. Here you go!

1319
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,440
Fast. What are you looking at?

1320
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,520
Nothing.. Pappi.

1321
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,200
Pappi Jaatwala.

1322
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,200
Who has done the booking?

1323
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,280
Ramesh. Where is Ramesh?
Where is he?

1324
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,040
He will back from
Varanasi, tomorrow evening.

1325
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,640
Send him to the police station
in the evening when he gets back.

1326
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,120
Okay. Yes. For enquiry.

1327
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,400
Whom? Ramesh. Okay!

1328
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,920
Ramlal. Yes, sir.

1329
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,400
Bring the car to the police station.
Okay, sir.

1330
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,520
To the station!

1331
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,680
Taxi! You guys carry on.

1332
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,800
Take it to.. I'll be right back.
This is not right.

1333
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,160
We'll share the money equally.

1334
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,200
We'll deal with him later.
Don't you worry.

1335
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,120
Hey, smarty pants.
Come in, buddy.

1336
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,400
Tell me the booking status
of a train to Mathura.

1337
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,320
To Mathura? Yes.

1338
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,240
Is Gulab going to Jharkhand?

1339
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,520
No way. The Diwans go to Gwalior

1340
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,200
every year on the
9th of this month.

1341
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,920
Happy journey!

1342
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,360
Mr. Pappi, I have a fabulous
news to share with you.

1343
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,600
I have heard that
the Diwans are going

1344
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,600
to Gwalior tomorrow.

1345
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,920
Ma'am..

1346
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,080
Ma'am, Mr. Tejpal has
sent these wedding cards.

1347
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,200
He has asked you to send your
favourite design by tomorrow.

1348
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,200
Thank you.

1349
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,920
Have a happy married life, ma'am.
Tell that to your boss.

1350
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,240
Hey, look here. There's the mosque.
We can't enter from here.

1351
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:11,240
There's an empty ground behind it.
It has a steep slope. It won't do!

1352
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,080
This is the entrance and
Gulab will be standing there.

1353
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,840
So we can't enter from here.
We have to enter

1354
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,160
through the side door only.

1355
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,920
Did you get it?
Try not to use your brains there.

1356
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:54,800
What is it? Tejpal has sent over
the designs for the wedding card.

1357
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,040
Pappi, this is our last chance.
If things don't work out well

1358
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,920
then we'll be left
with no choice.

1359
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,080
Come on, let's go.
We've work to do.

1360
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,440
I don't know anyone..
Show him the other ones.

1361
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,920
No, sir, I don't..
Check them out properly.

1362
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,640
Come one.. Sir, he has again
stripped a woman's blouse today.

1363
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,280
Get him inside. I'm coming.

1364
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,280
You want your mother and sister,
safe at home, but you'll go around

1365
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,160
stripping blouses
of other women.

1366
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,200
None of them among these.

1367
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,480
What about these?

1368
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,240
No, sir..
Are you kidding with me?

1369
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,320
Put him in the lock up.
I'll rip his skin off.

1370
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,560
Sir, I'm telling you the truth..
Come on.

1371
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,080
You'll learn a lesson today.
Please believe me..

1372
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,800
Someone is surely going
to have a bad day!

1373
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,400
Sir, he's the one..
What do you mean?

1374
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,840
He is Pappi!

1375
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,560
He's the one.
He rented the van to him.

1376
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,360
Yes, sir. He's Pappi.
Take him away.

1377
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,280
Let's go now.

1378
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,880
Sir, I didn't do anything..
Come now.

1379
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:21,840
Look, I've got your picture.

1380
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,240
Have a look. It suits you.

1381
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,480
Get the water ready, to wash hands.
Yes, sir.

1382
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,480
Yes, you!

1383
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,320
Come fast.

1384
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,000
What nonsense is going on?

1385
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,920
You guys wait here.
I'll call you. Okay?

1386
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,000
Okay. Be careful, Mr. Pappi.

1387
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,000
"Darling.."

1388
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,000
"Darling.."

1389
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,440
"An evil eye, darling.."

1390
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,240
"An evil eye, darling.."

1391
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:40,680
"An evil eye, darling.."

1392
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,440
"An evil eye, darling.."

1393
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:52,640
"Someone has cast an evil
eye on your mansion."

1394
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:56,840
"Your.. On your mansion."

1395
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,080
Hello. Your plan got ruined.

1396
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,520
Stop using your brains!
Be there for some time.

1397
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,720
I'll thrash him.

1398
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,560
"If I were a cuckoo bird.."

1399
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,200
Why are they conducting such
an eyecatching program today?

1400
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,320
"If I were a cuckoo bird.." Jaggi, Gulab..
Gulab is there.

1401
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,760
"If I were a cuckoo bird.."

1402
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,320
"I'd be cooing all along."

1403
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:39,480
"I'd be cooing all along."
Haven't you seen women at home?

1404
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,400
"I'd be cooing in
front of your mansion."

1405
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,480
"Someone has casted an evil
eye upon your mansion."

1406
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,280
"Darling.."

1407
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,880
Oh, no! What happened?

1408
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,520
Here's that guy whose
photo you have showed me.

1409
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,000
Leave it. I'll just come.
Wait, Sona..

1410
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,640
Sona, listen to me..
Sona, wait..

1411
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:05,120
"If I were a cloud.." Tell me!

1412
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:12,360
"If I were a cloud.." Yes?
Pappi, where are you?

1413
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,200
Sona has left to seek that guy.

1414
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,800
What! She left? Where to?

1415
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,120
"Darling,
I'd have been pouring.."

1416
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,800
"Darling,
I'd have been pouring.."

1417
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,320
"Darling, I'd have been
pouring over your mansion."

1418
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,040
"Over your mansion, darling."

1419
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:46,240
Where is she?
"If I were a fragrant flower.."

1420
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,200
"If I were a fragrant flower.."

1421
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,880
"If I were a fragrant
flower.." Jaggi..

1422
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,680
When will you return my money?
Get lost!

1423
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,080
"I'd have been spreading
fragrance.." As if I'm returning.

1424
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,320
"I'd have been spreading
fragrance in your mansion."

1425
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,120
"In your mansion, darling."
Hey, you all, come inside.

1426
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,120
Didn't I say, the terrace
would ultimately reach here?

1427
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:20,920
Yes, tell me.
Come towards that wall

1428
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,920
the same which is in the lane.
There is staircase.

1429
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,240
Climb that up and you'll
find us on the terrace.

1430
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,640
What do you mean? I mean

1431
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,880
the terrace after two
blocks, got it?

1432
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,800
"If I were your bride.."
Don't waste time.

1433
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,360
We'll tell others that
you've discovered it.

1434
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,640
"Darling.."

1435
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,520
"I'd have been flaunting,
darling." This was bound to happen.

1436
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,400
"I'd have been flaunting
in your mansion, darling."

1437
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:50,240
"I'd have been flaunting
in your mansion, darling."

1438
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:58,120
"Someone has casted an evil
eye upon your mansion."

1439
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,840
"Upon your mansion.."

1440
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:07,240
Darling.. Come, follow me..

1441
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,240
"I'm your rose.."

1442
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,880
Let's see, where it reaches.

1443
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,600
Oh.. We're in trouble!

1444
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:29,040
We're also following him like a fool.
Oh, no!

1445
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,600
There is a lane, a big one.

1446
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,640
Around eight feet gap is
there between the two walls.

1447
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:38,920
Look at it.

1448
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,520
What's next?

1449
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,760
It's completely fine, pals.

1450
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,560
Has God placed this
ladder to reach our doom?

1451
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,520
Right. If anyone falls down,
he'll surely reach his doom.

1452
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,600
Pappi,
what nonsense are you talking?

1453
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,480
Haven't you ran after
kites in your childhood?

1454
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,680
We used to cross such
roofs quite easily.

1455
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,680
Then what are you waiting for?

1456
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,760
We aren't here to fiddle
around, guys.

1457
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,800
Pals, make a bridge out of that ladder.
Should I?

1458
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,200
Come on, Ajji!
Yes, place it. Move.

1459
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,200
Come on, place it.
Placing it, man.

1460
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,200
Come on, Pappi. Slowly..
Remember the God and let's do it.

1461
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:17,080
No, I won't.
Oh, look at that, man.

1462
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,880
She's just like a juicy plum.
Oh, her silky tresses..

1463
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Hey, she's removing her blouse off.
Oh, the spicy red chilli..

1464
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,400
Just get her to me once..

1465
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,400
Oh, she's the figure of gold.
Oh!

1466
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,800
Make us your mirror.

1467
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:36,080
Oh.. Hook me up, darling..

1468
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,400
What are you saying?

1469
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,600
Who is dillydallying, now?
Tell me, Jaggi?

1470
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,040
Mr. Pappi, you do get some action.
Hey!

1471
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,160
But do we get such
chances frequently?

1472
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,800
Hey, leave it, buddy.

1473
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,560
Darn it! What happened? Move.

1474
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,680
Pappi, leave it, buddy.

1475
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,040
Careful.

1476
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,080
Hail Lord Hanuman!
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1477
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,640
Carefully..
Fix your step properly.

1478
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,240
Thank you. Anytime.

1479
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,920
God is kind. Where is Kalawati?

1480
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,240
Hurry up. Look over there.
There is a door.

1481
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,720
Jaggi, go there. Yes. Shut it.

1482
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,160
It must be locked from inside.
Have you found anything?

1483
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,360
There is a balcony
on the first floor.

1484
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,560
We would need to reach
there using a rope.

1485
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,080
Ajji. Yes. Take out the rope.

1486
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,120
Tie it firmly!

1487
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,800
Get lost!

1488
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,880
Listen. Let go of me.

1489
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,280
Stop. Police..

1490
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,560
Listen..

1491
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,880
Ajji. Yes. Be careful.

1492
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,800
Dear, I used to climb
ropes in the arena.

1493
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,760
Just wait and watch. Oh, God!

1494
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,760
Kalawati. Get lost!

1495
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,360
Is it a swing or what?
I have injured my hand.

1496
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,280
You could have
landed downstairs.

1497
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,800
What are you doing here?
I am playing drums.

1498
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,920
Let's do it together, then.

1499
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,360
Come on. Kalawati.

1500
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,520
Oh, God!
That old man is at home.

1501
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,360
Kalawati. He is here.

1502
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,120
Ajji said that no one would
be there in the mansion today.

1503
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,480
He is Mr. Diwan. Kalawati.

1504
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,320
Come here. There is a staircase.

1505
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,640
Kalawati.

1506
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,320
My sweetheart..

1507
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,560
My..

1508
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,760
Get lost!

1509
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,920
Key.. Key..

1510
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,320
Get lost! Have a tight sleep.

1511
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,760
Come. Put the light there. Yes.

1512
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,360
I think there is something behind.
Oh..

1513
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,160
I will give you a tight slap.
Hold the torch up, you moron!

1514
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,600
It's found. Great!
Let's go and inform Jaggi.

1515
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:26,800
Okay, let's go.

1516
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,800
You lead us. Come on. Yes..

1517
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,160
They must be there,
on the other side.

1518
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,120
Where is the staircase?
Be careful.

1519
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,240
We can take the other way.

1520
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,600
They are standing there.
Signal them.

1521
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,160
Look there. Over there..

1522
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,840
I think they have
found the staircase.

1523
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,800
Come. Let's go.

1524
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,480
Yes, Rampal. Tell me quickly.
My battery is about to get drained.

1525
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,640
'Sir,
Jaggi was spotted by a man'

1526
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,680
'near Asharam's
eatery..' Asharam's..

1527
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,000
Hello..

1528
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,720
Do you see that motorbike coming?
We can start from there. Got it?

1529
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,560
Oh, no.. Who is it?

1530
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,440
Who is there? Bend down..

1531
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,120
Hello.

1532
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,280
Pappi.

1533
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,880
What if she is Kalawati? Go..

1534
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:39,120
Pappi, where are you?

1535
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,800
Hello. Sona.

1536
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,200
She is Sona. Come on. Oh, God!

1537
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,240
Pappi.

1538
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,800
Is everything all right?
She is coming as if..

1539
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,400
How come you are here?
Where is that loafer?

1540
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,360
He is asleep.
He won't get up before tomorrow.

1541
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,480
Great!

1542
01:33:56,480 --> 01:34:00,560
But why are you all
looking so dull?

1543
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,640
Tell her.

1544
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,200
We have reached here
with great difficulty.

1545
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,800
My knees got scratched.
And our captain..

1546
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,320
Didn't you think that we could
ask her to fetch the keys?

1547
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,800
You never know.

1548
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:13,160
What if the door
was locked there?

1549
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,600
What if Sona couldn't fool him?

1550
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,760
You.. Shut up! I..

1551
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,640
You moron! Hold on.
Quiet.. Quiet..

1552
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,800
He thinks he is very smart.
Shut up!

1553
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,520
Guys,
can we search for the treasure?

1554
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:33,440
Tuffy.. Tuffy, stop.
Tuffy, stop..

1555
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,600
Tuffy..

1556
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,800
That's the old man's room.
Let's go.

1557
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:41,800
Come on..
How come you're smelling so good?

1558
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,160
It's a nice fragrance
that I am wearing.

1559
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,920
Light the torch.
Don't act smart! It's done..

1560
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,280
Focus on the task.. Quietly..

1561
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,760
Put the light here. Check it..

1562
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,160
There is nothing.

1563
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,880
What's that bright thing?

1564
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,680
'DiwaniAm' from the Red Fort.
Listen. What?

1565
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,040
I think someone else
is here apart from us.

1566
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,280
Is it? Yes.

1567
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,200
There is no one here except us.
She is right. No one is there.

1568
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,360
When I was climbing down

1569
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,680
I felt as if someone
was behind me.

1570
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,880
Where does Jaggi sit?

1571
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,560
Even we come here.

1572
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,360
Serve two Parathas.

1573
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,000
Keep quiet. Nothing will happen.

1574
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,200
Come. Hey, listen..

1575
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,000
Listen.. Look at this.
We have found the treasure.

1576
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,680
Come. Come fast.

1577
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,640
Is it locked?
What are you saying? Oh, my!

1578
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,800
Have you unlocked it? Hey..

1579
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,360
Jaggi.. Did you see?

1580
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:40,320
Our destiny will change.

1581
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,640
Listen.
Will you be able to unlock it?

1582
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,240
Pappi, there is nothing
which Haggu can't do!

1583
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,800
Where did they find him?
Come on.

1584
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,160
This lock..
What are you looking at?

1585
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,680
Just unlock it! Yes!

1586
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,080
Now, I have found the spot.

1587
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,440
We need to push
the door together.

1588
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,640
Got it? Yes..

1589
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,800
We need to push the door together.
Okay..

1590
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,000
Remembering the God. Okay..

1591
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,400
In the centre. Come on.

1592
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,640
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1593
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:15,200
Don't pull it. Push it.

1594
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,800
Oh, my!

1595
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,280
Kalawati.

1596
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,240
You bloody..

1597
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,760
Kalawati.

1598
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,000
Where were you, Kalawati?

1599
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,800
The entire place is
fragrant with your scent.

1600
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,600
Kalawati. To heck with..

1601
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,800
You must have used
Kalawati's attar.

1602
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,160
He stole it and gave it to you.

1603
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,560
She applies makeup all the time.

1604
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,360
How would I know?

1605
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,800
Our plan will be ruined
if he loses temper.

1606
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,480
Hello.. He..

1607
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,880
Why are you troubling
me, Kalawati?

1608
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,920
Listen. Go and take care of him.

1609
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:02,480
Ma'am, show your talent. Ma'am..

1610
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,800
Sona, bail us out.

1611
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,720
Come on. Put it. No..

1612
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,200
Sometimes,
one needs to face problems bravely.

1613
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,800
Go.. Nothing will happen.
Go.. Go..

1614
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,920
No..

1615
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,200
God, save her. Kalawati.

1616
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,280
Kalawati.
Dear, you are still awake!

1617
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,440
Yes? How can I sleep?

1618
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,880
Jasmine! Jasmine?

1619
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,000
I am Kalawati. You are Kalawati.

1620
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,680
But you smell like jasmines.
Yes.

1621
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:36,120
Where were you for so long?
He has gone crazy.

1622
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,320
My sweetheart..

1623
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,200
No one talks to me courteously.
Really?

1624
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:41,360
Everyone is narrow minded.

1625
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,080
But why didn't you
inform me before leaving?

1626
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:48,800
You were in deep sleep.

1627
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,720
So, I didn't disturb you.

1628
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:56,800
No one loves me
like the way you do.

1629
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,800
My sweetheart! I am here, right?

1630
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,800
Everything will be fine now.
It's already 3 a.m.

1631
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,560
I haven't understood
your plan yet.

1632
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,280
People will start
pouring in from 5 a.m.

1633
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,600
The temple will be open by then.

1634
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,800
The flower vendor sits
outside the mansion.

1635
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,080
What to do now?

1636
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,640
Tell us! Listen to him first.
Pappi. Yes.

1637
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:17,320
What's the plan now?
Let's form two teams. Again. Okay?

1638
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,360
"Love is crazy.." Shut up!

1639
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,800
What happened? Who are you? Why?

1640
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,680
What's wrong with your voice?

1641
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,520
Actually,
I am having a sore throat.

1642
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,240
So? Then I..

1643
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,560
Manua who sells betel.. Manua?

1644
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,800
'Mulethi'.. Not Manua!

1645
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,640
What did you hear?
I had 'Mulethi'.

1646
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:39,800
'Mulethi'! Yes.

1647
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,720
Then, I chewed pepper
and cardamom as well.

1648
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:45,040
What are you saying?
Are you all right?

1649
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,600
Why? What happened?
Does that mean I've changed?

1650
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:49,920
And you boast that you love me!
I didn't mean that.

1651
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,560
Is this how much you love me?
Don't be mad at me!

1652
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,240
Tell me? Calm down. Sit.

1653
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,240
Actually,
I am having a very bad day..

1654
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,560
Who is there?
Where is this sound coming from?

1655
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,360
There is no one.
Cats are running around.

1656
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,440
Get lost! Go from here.

1657
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,800
To heck with them!
There is no one else.

1658
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,080
What are you saying?

1659
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,320
You went to meet your
mother, right?

1660
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:13,240
You become illtempered
after returning from there.

1661
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:17,440
I don't like it at all.
Are you not feeling sleepy?

1662
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:21,320
Dear.. Did I ever go
to bed without you?

1663
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,080
Are you not scared
of falling down?

1664
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,400
Come.
You are Jaggi's aide, right?

1665
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,560
Let's go and search for him.
How would I know where he is?

1666
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,440
Come on. Start the scooter.
Come on.

1667
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:19,800
Sit.

1668
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,080
God knows whom Mahinder has
given my TV for repairing.

1669
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,760
It's of no use!

1670
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,040
The same news has been running
all throughout the day.

1671
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:37,640
It seems everything will
be destroyed in 2015.

1672
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,800
No one knows what
lies in future.

1673
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,760
Why are you talking
about 2015 in 1985?

1674
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,360
That's true.

1675
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:47,400
Let's not talk about future!

1676
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,400
I won't spare him

1677
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:54,080
if anything happens to Sona.
She is too smart.

1678
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,680
She will make his life miserable.
To heck with this!

1679
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:01,080
Be careful. There is nothing.

1680
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,240
Come here. Yes. Put light there.

1681
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,280
No one can imagine that
there is a basement in here.

1682
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,760
Hey, it's a spiral staircase.

1683
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:20,040
Hey.. Come on..

1684
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,680
Put the light here. Be careful..

1685
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,360
What a weird place!

1686
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:37,400
Pappi has won a lottery
on the full moon night.

1687
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,480
There are antique
items all over here.

1688
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,760
His destiny is going to be changed.
Jaggi. What?

1689
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Come here..

1690
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,720
Come here.. Why are you shouting?
Come fast. Yes..

1691
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,400
What's wrong with him?
There is gold all over.

1692
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:46,920
Come. There is gold all over.
Let's go..

1693
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,800
Gold.. Has he gone mad?
What has happened?

1694
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:49,800
Here is Lord Krishna's idol
which is made up of gold.

1695
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,600
There is gold all over.
Why are you shivering?

1696
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,200
There is a an idol of
gold of Lord Krishna.

1697
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,680
There is another gold idol.
Wait.

1698
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,360
There is another gold idol..
Wait.

1699
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,440
There is another gold idol..

1700
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,800
There is another gold idol
of Lord Ganesh. Shut up!

1701
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,640
Shut up. Let me check first.

1702
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,520
Wait..

1703
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,240
Please forgive me, Lord Krishna.

1704
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,520
What's in there?

1705
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,320
Oh, God! What happened?

1706
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,320
What's that? What's that?

1707
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,360
Have you seen a ghost?

1708
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,880
Pappi, stairway to hell.

1709
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,000
Check it out!

1710
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,440
What have you found?

1711
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,360
It's brass.

1712
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,880
Should we believe him or not?

1713
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:45,200
It's brass.
You have spoiled 15 minutes.

1714
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,280
What's my fault?
He said that it was gold.

1715
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,600
Do heck with it! Oh, no!

1716
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,400
What else was running on TV?

1717
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:56,800
Qutub Minar is being
shifted from Mehrauli. Why?

1718
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:01,520
Aeroplanes might
collide with it.

1719
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:03,360
Where is it being shifted to?

1720
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:07,800
They have seen a place on
the other side of the Yamuna.

1721
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,760
How will they shift it?

1722
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,800
They will make a flyover.

1723
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:17,080
After that,
it will be shifted on wheels.

1724
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,440
On wheels? Yes.

1725
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,360
Did you hear anything?

1726
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,400
Let's go..

1727
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:36,800
Come on..

1728
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,160
God..

1729
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,800
Hail Lord! Please save us.

1730
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,880
It seems we have
reached the right place.

1731
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,640
In ancient times, people used to
hide the treasure in the temples.

1732
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,440
You are right.
Shall I start digging?

1733
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,480
What! Digging.

1734
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,800
You say, 'Digging'.
I hear something else.

1735
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,120
Oh, God!

1736
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:03,080
What do you think
that you will find

1737
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,160
inside this broken chest?

1738
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,720
He was checking it, so,
I thought of doing the same.

1739
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,600
Sometimes,
we find the way unexpectedly.

1740
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:10,880
Just forget it. Come here.

1741
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,200
Tell him. It's already 4 a.m.

1742
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:13,880
You talk rubbish.

1743
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:15,480
Find the door.

1744
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,400
Ajji! Yes.

1745
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:20,400
Look here. Go there and check..

1746
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,720
Ask me to do anything.

1747
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,160
It's completely dark inside.
Jump inside.

1748
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,280
Shall I jump? Go ahead.

1749
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:34,000
He is finished. Oh, God!

1750
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,360
I asked him to check
before jumping.

1751
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:42,160
You just asked him to jump.
I see.

1752
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,200
Tuffy..

1753
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,000
Tuffy.. Tuffy, where are you..

1754
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,280
What are you doing here?
I am searching for my dog.

1755
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,560
I have lost my dog. What?

1756
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,280
Did your dog escape
from your house?

1757
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:59,920
At this time?
Mr. Tejpal, you can ask Jaggi.

1758
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,480
I am supposed to get money..
Where did you meet him?

1759
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:04,200
Where did you meet him?
Come with me.

1760
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:06,160
Mr. Tejpal.. Sit..

1761
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,880
What have I done? Kickstart it!

1762
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,880
I was searching for my dog.
Let him sit.

1763
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,040
Why are you taking me along?

1764
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,320
Let me find my dog.

1765
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:17,040
Who is it.. There's no one!
I told you before.

1766
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:20,240
I'll not let anyone
enter this building..

1767
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,880
Have you gone mad! I'll not let
them enter.. Someone is here!

1768
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,280
Mahinder..

1769
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,240
I'll not let you demolish this
mansion to build a market place..

1770
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:31,160
Who's inside..
No one is going to demolish your house.

1771
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:32,600
Please calm down! Who is inside?

1772
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,600
Who is it..
No one's going to demolish it..

1773
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,480
Kallu.. Yes.

1774
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:42,840
The front wall is damaged.

1775
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,520
What? Yes.

1776
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:47,040
Check and tell me if the
front door is broken or not.

1777
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,000
Yes, it's broken..

1778
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,360
What are you doing? Move aside.

1779
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:54,240
The front door! You're pointing
a gun at me! Check the door!

1780
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,360
Okay! Check the door! Hold on.

1781
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,880
There's a wall..

1782
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,840
What's inside the wall?
That means..

1783
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:02,520
Someone's inside the house!
You mean inside the wall?

1784
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,920
Yes. What?

1785
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,600
I'll not spare you..

1786
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,320
I'll not spare anyone..

1787
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,320
Mahinder,
I won't let anyone come inside.

1788
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,680
Hey, I can smell gold.

1789
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,000
Look, there's a door ahead.

1790
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,680
A closed door!

1791
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,040
It's locked from outside!

1792
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,920
How do we.. How can you..

1793
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,200
Let me see!
Come on, Mr. Detective.

1794
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,320
We've to break it open.

1795
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,600
Let's smash this door.

1796
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,800
Let's try from the other side.
Come on!

1797
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:19,920
Come on..

1798
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:23,440
Aim for the sweet spot.
The centre.

1799
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,200
Bless us, God.. Bless us, God..

1800
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,320
One.. Two, three..

1801
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:36,120
Who was that.. Open the door.

1802
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,200
Who is it..
How did you get here..

1803
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,160
How did you come here..
Where were you.. Pappi!

1804
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:45,800
Pappi.. Pappi.. Listen!

1805
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,400
How did you get here..

1806
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,400
I found the way to the safe.
Come on..

1807
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,360
What!

1808
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,040
Sir.. A dog..

1809
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:07,360
Right.. Straight..

1810
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:11,440
Come on.. Come on, Pappi.

1811
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,040
Don't start jumping.

1812
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,800
Electricity must be there.
Quiet..

1813
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:27,240
Come on.. Electricity..

1814
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:29,240
The lights are on!
Come on, Pappi.

1815
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,800
Let's open this up.

1816
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,200
Bless us, God!

1817
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,880
Pappi was right.
It's six feet long!

1818
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:40,080
This must be packed with treasure.
Thank you, God..

1819
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:42,560
Look at that picture.
It looks weird.

1820
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,800
Bless us, Lord!

1821
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:49,400
Haggu, get started. Yes, boss.

1822
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,880
Come on, my friend,
show us your magic.

1823
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,840
Come on.. Calm down!
Quiet, guys!

1824
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,400
How did you get here?
Let me work peacefully.

1825
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:56,840
Do your work quietly
and get out of here.

1826
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,600
That old man is firing
bullets outside.

1827
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,800
Haggu.

1828
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:04,480
Haggu! Say something at least!
Come on! Tell me.

1829
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:07,760
Five and a half turns..
It's perfect.

1830
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,680
Come on, you beauty..

1831
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,240
Open up, damn it! Hey! Oh, no!

1832
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,760
I'll buy Chandni Chowk..
Let it open, first.

1833
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,640
Hey, radio head! Stop now!

1834
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,400
The lever inside this is jammed.
We need to cut it open.

1835
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,920
What is a lever?
The lever is jammed! Shut up!

1836
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,160
You.. How can the lever be..

1837
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:32,480
Tejpal, this..
Jagjit entered through this gate.

1838
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:34,600
Babbe and Ajji
were also with him.

1839
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,160
Hey, you can go and find your dog.
Okay.

1840
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:43,040
Hey! Find Jaggi! Okay, sir.

1841
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:52,600
Is it done? Almost done.

1842
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,560
Hey, come on, open it up.

1843
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:58,440
Come on, open up.

1844
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:07,320
Let me touch this once!
Let me touch..

1845
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,600
Goods had come from the
Red Fort to this place.

1846
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,560
I think it must have
belonged to princess Jodha.

1847
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:16,760
Guys, if you trust me

1848
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,880
this statue of Lord Krishna
will be worth millions. Hey!

1849
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,760
We'll not steal God's statue.

1850
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:25,160
Rest of it is also worth millions!
And that's enough!

1851
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:26,720
What's this?
What are you saying?

1852
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,360
Going by your logic,
stealing anything would be not right.

1853
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:30,680
But we have come here to steal.
Yes.

1854
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:33,080
Neither does God have a
problem with us taking it. Hey!

1855
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,480
Let him get cursed.

1856
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,560
We'll get.. Hey..

1857
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,760
What are you doing?
Who was that?

1858
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,080
Who else could it be!

1859
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,560
Who could it be!

1860
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,840
GG..

1861
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:50,360
GGod.. Right. God!

1862
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,840
GGod?
Aren't you scared of stealing?

1863
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:56,320
We are, sir..
So why are you stealing then?

1864
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:00,560
We are not doing very well..
Else, we wouldn't have stolen.

1865
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,240
Hey.. Very bad!

1866
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:07,760
That's just an excuse.
It wasn't an excuse, God!

1867
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:12,080
You've not given us enough and
that's why we have to steal.

1868
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,840
I just created this world

1869
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,520
and gave it to you.

1870
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:20,600
I don't care what you do with

1871
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:23,280
the world that I gave you.

1872
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:25,600
You are in this situation
because of yourself.

1873
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:27,920
We.. Our fault.. Ours, you say..

1874
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,480
We put ourselves in this, sir?

1875
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:33,520
Yes! You are in this situation
because of your greed.

1876
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,640
You're trapped in
a cycle of greed.

1877
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,920
If you want to get out of this

1878
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,080
you'll have to stop your greed!

1879
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:44,080
Stop our greed!
Stop our greed! Greed?

1880
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,400
Hail God..

1881
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:01,560
Once my teacher had said this in class!
Shut up!

1882
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,320
But I didn't
understand half of it.

1883
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,480
Oh, my dear!

1884
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,400
As you sow, so shall you reap!

1885
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,760
But, God, what did we sow
that we're reaping this?

1886
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,920
That's your business.

1887
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,640
It's none of my business!

1888
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:29,480
God.. Sorry, God.
Don't get me wrong.

1889
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:32,800
But what's your business then?
What is it? It's nothing.

1890
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:33,920
What do you mean?

1891
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:38,880
Dear, I just said it.
Everything is in your hands.

1892
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,800
I have nothing to do with it!
No..

1893
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:44,480
Excuse me, God. Yes.

1894
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:48,280
Why did you create it if you
have got nothing to do with it.

1895
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,720
My dear boy! Yes.

1896
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,920
Why don't you speak to
me in your mother tongue?

1897
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:56,720
Hey, say it in Hindi!
Okay! All right..

1898
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:01,480
I meant, when you don't want
anything to do with this world

1899
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,400
why did you create it?

1900
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:07,360
Child, I am just an artist.
Okay.

1901
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:11,080
I have just expressed myself!
Okay..

1902
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,760
In the language of love and passion.
Okay!

1903
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,360
It's very difficult

1904
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,920
to write love stories. Indeed.

1905
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:22,720
It's like writing water
with water on water!

1906
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,440
Excellent! Amazing..

1907
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,920
That was brilliant, God!
Water on water.. Great..

1908
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:28,280
Great.. Amazing!

1909
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,520
But God, love has brought
us down to our knees.

1910
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,480
Now no one gives a damn!

1911
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,880
The eye does give a
damn, you know.

1912
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,920
Change your perception to view
the same things differently.

1913
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:45,080
God, I think you're just
beating around the bush.

1914
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,760
I mean,
I'm starting to doubt this..

1915
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,680
God, if you could give us a
glimpse of you we'd have been sure.

1916
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:53,080
Right.. We would've been sure.
Yes..

1917
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:00,160
You mean special effects?
Only a glimpse of..

1918
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:04,040
A small.. A miracle, you mean.
Just once.

1919
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,920
Turn towards the stairs!
Yes.. Okay..

1920
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,480
Backwards?

1921
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,840
Did you turn around?
Yes, we did..

1922
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,600
Okay. Hail God!

1923
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:20,480
I'm right here.

1924
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,800
Now I will show you

1925
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:26,920
what you want to see.

1926
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,720
Turn around one by one.

1927
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,760
You..

1928
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:06,240
God, I want to go to Russia..

1929
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,520
You know everything, Lord!

1930
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:34,800
God, forgive me..

1931
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,080
Pappi!

1932
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,160
God you know everything..

1933
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:23,520
GGod..

1934
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,200
God..

1935
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:29,160
God..

1936
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:38,320
Hey!

1937
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:44,520
Gulab!

1938
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,920
Tejpal! What!

1939
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,480
YYes, sir! Sir, yes..

1940
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:55,320
God, tell us what we should do.

1941
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:00,720
The decision is in your hands.
God!

1942
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:03,840
Sin or virtue!

1943
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:07,040
Sir, I don't know
anyone called Jaggi..

1944
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,240
I telling the truth! Trust me..

1945
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,280
Sir, don't let me go..

1946
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:13,080
Why weren't you
sleeping in the mansion?

1947
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,840
You scoundrel,
why were you sleeping here?

1948
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:17,040
I was drunk, sir..

1949
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:21,360
I was high!
Don't let me fall.. Don't..

1950
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:43,280
Sir..

1951
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,480
What do you see?

1952
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:55,200
My Kallu is dead..

1953
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:00,920
My beloved Kallu
has left me forever!

1954
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,880
People come to this planet
to leave it someday.

1955
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,600
'Be it a king or a beggar'

1956
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:13,080
'everyone perishes in the end.'

1957
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:16,120
Go!

1958
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:18,400
Get some sleep!

1959
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,080
Your Kallu is in heaven.

1960
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:25,400
And she is happier than you!

1961
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,760
My Kallu is in heaven!

1962
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,760
And she is happier than me!

1963
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:37,320
My Kallu is in heaven

1964
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,560
and she is happier than me..

1965
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:42,840
"The swan will fly..
Alone if required.."

1966
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,560
"To see the world.."

1967
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:51,080
"To see the world,
the swan will fly"

1968
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:53,480
"alone if required."

1969
01:58:58,440 --> 01:58:59,520
Psycho!

1970
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,280
What are you doing here?
'Neither did I do anything.'

1971
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,080
'Nor I was able to do it!'

1972
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,760
'The thing that I
was supposed to do..'

1973
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,760
What are you doing?
'Whatever was done'

1974
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,360
'was done by the grace of God.'
You have gone through a lot!

1975
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,120
Get some rest.

1976
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:19,320
Fall asleep and float on
clouds made up of dreams!

1977
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,600
Oh, yes!

1978
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:24,680
Inspector Vijay
Dinanath Chauhan!

1979
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,920
Amitabh Bachchan.. Shut up!

1980
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:30,040
I'm your senior, salute me.

1981
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:33,920
That's like a good boy!
Very very good.

1982
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,040
Take out your wallet.

1983
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,160
Very good!

1984
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,800
Give him your watch and ring.

1985
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:48,840
A gold chain in your wallet!

1986
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,560
I'd bought that to gift it
to my wife after our wedding.

1987
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:57,280
What will I do by
stealing your dreams?

1988
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:01,400
Rs. 100 is enough for me.

1989
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,920
Now that I've taken something,
I'll also give you something in return!

1990
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:09,040
Take it! Lord Shiva's blessings!

1991
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:10,440
Swallow it.

1992
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,560
'The king of Braj,
the one loved by Nanda'

1993
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:17,920
'wait no more,
come to me without much ado.'

1994
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,440
You're very responsible.
Eat it up!

1995
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:24,160
You are very honest!

1996
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:28,720
Take this wealth and donate
it to the Kali temple.

1997
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:31,440
Come on. Pick it up!

1998
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,680
Good!
You should also get to work.

1999
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,120
Sir..

2000
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:45,200
Sir.. Come this way, sir.
Hail the Lord!

2001
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:54,440
"You've made me restless merely
by casting a glance upon me."

2002
02:00:54,880 --> 02:01:01,120
"You've made me restless merely
by casting a glance upon me."

2003
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:07,840
"You've made me restless merely
by casting a glance upon me."

2004
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:11,840
"With just a glance..
You stole me away.."

2005
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:14,720
Let's go. Let's get going.

2006
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:22,800
"You've intoxicated me merely
by casting a glance upon me."

2007
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:23,840
Hey!

2008
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:26,480
I have learnt
something from you.

2009
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:32,240
There is no shortcut for success.
One needs to have good intentions

2010
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:34,800
and be determined.

2011
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:36,240
That's all it takes.

2012
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:40,640
Then sooner or later,
you'll find what you're looking for.

2013
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:42,520
That's all up to God.

2014
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,440
You're right.
I got to know that, today.

2015
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:50,240
I love you, pal..
Easy.. I love you..

2016
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:54,440
Love you, buddy..
We'll never steal again. Okay..

2017
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:58,920
"By making me drink the wine
from the love of devotion"

2018
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:05,520
"you've intoxicated me merely
by casting a glance upon me."

2019
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:12,200
"You've intoxicated me merely
by casting a glance upon me."

2020
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:25,120
Sir, Gulab told me that in
the mansion you and.. No..

2021
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,800
Sir..

2022
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:30,080
Is everything alright?

2023
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,840
Hail Goddess Bhavani!

2024
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:35,680
Everything is fine.
Hail Goddess..

2025
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:40,480
Confiscate this sack and take
it to the police station.

2026
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,720
Where is Jaggi?

2027
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,920
Hail Mahalaxmi..

2028
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:51,400
I have to break his leg!

2029
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:57,080
Jaggi..
I have to teach him a lesson!

2030
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:02,640
Confiscate it and take it
to the police station..

2031
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:08,840
Hail Goddess Kali!

2032
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:13,160
I have to go..

2033
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,560
Hail Bajrangbali!

2034
02:03:58,200 --> 02:03:59,160
Hey!

2035
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:04,720
Hey, read it out.

2036
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:11,320
Oh, my!

2037
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,720
Oh, my! You're alive!

2038
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,800
I won the lottery!

2039
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:20,480
I won the lottery..

2040
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:25,520
I won the lottery..
God has finally listened to me.

2041
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:31,240
Mr. Pappi! I..

2042
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:36,800
Oh, my! Rub my feet..

2043
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,120
I have won the lottery!

2044
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:45,400
Don't be upset, dear.
Freshen up and come to my place.

2045
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,560
We'll go to the temple
from there itself.

2046
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:49,080
We'll get married today itself.

2047
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:52,080
I have won 2 crore rupees!

2048
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:50,080
Sir, listen to me.

2049
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:54,720
You're having a misconception.
I'll teach you a lesson, now.

2050
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:57,840
You're not getting me.
Why would I hit Pappi!

2051
02:05:57,880 --> 02:05:59,080
He is like a brother to me.

2052
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,360
Here we are. I'll teach you..

2053
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:15,800
Sir! Greetings!

2054
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,680
The police told me
that you did everything

2055
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:19,240
possible in order to help me.

2056
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,080
Hey, Jaggi!

2057
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,120
What did you do?

2058
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:25,480
Nothing as such.
He's taking me on a ride.

2059
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,840
Are you getting married, today?

2060
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,280
But you should've.. Let it be!

2061
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:32,360
You'll be in big trouble.
I know that. Relax.

2062

Hello, Inspector.

2063
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:38,520
What could I say when the
kids have already decided.

2064
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,480
Please forgive me.
Out of your good nature..

2065
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:46,160
It'll be great if
you could bless them.

2066
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:48,120
Come on!

2067
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:01,200
Wish you a happy married
life, Pappi!

2068
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:06,720
Sir.. Sir, we spotted Bichhi at
the Old Delhi railway station.

2069
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:09,800
What? We spotted Bichhi

2070
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,080
at the Old Delhi
railway station.

2071
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,760
Kickstart it. What?

2072
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,080
Kickstart the scooter! Yes.

2073
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:21,160
I'll see you at the party!

2074
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:23,520
Hey..

2075
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,400
You tell me, now! Has he left?

2076
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:30,480
Yes. Then what about..

2077
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,560
Oh! Was it that simple?

2078
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:43,560
Birds of same feather
flock together.

2079
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:46,640
Hey, Pappi!
