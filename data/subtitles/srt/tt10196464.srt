1
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,750
No.

2
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,666
It's off-key.

3
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,250
I'm telling you, it's off-key.
Play it again.

4
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,416
Oh, God!

5
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,333
Let it be.

6
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,708
-Why are you nagging him?
-The piano's out of tune.

7
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,708
-Here.
-Play it, come on.

8
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:36,458
Take this. You are not well.
Get some rest, okay?

9
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,750
Saksham, it's quite late.
You should go home.

10
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,541
No, sit down.

11
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,541
But--

12
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:47,458
-He's not playing it correctly.
-Teach him how to play it tomorrow.

13
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:51,708
No, you mustn't stop until you learn
to play a musical instrument properly.

14
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,833
You must respect it.

15
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,416
Otherwise, the notes will be mad.

16
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,666
Even if you play one note incorrectly,
it'll affect the entire tune.

17
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,541
-Come on, play it--
-Do as you please!

18
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,750
You never listen to me!

19
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,875
You've turned the house into a junkyard!

20
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,750
And what's with this gigantic piano!

21
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:15,083
You're not well,
so I have to do all the cleaning!

22
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,875
Whatever!

23
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,791
Grandpa, I'll come tomorrow
and play the tune properly.

24
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:26,125
Its notes are out of tune.
It must be restrung.

25
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,500
-Okay, Grandpa. I'll restring it tomorrow.
-Okay.

26
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,416
-Good night.
-Good night, son.

27
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:35,000
-Good night, Grandma!
-Good night! Go home now!

28
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,666
Who wants to live here, anyway!

29
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,250
We're just stuck here.

30
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,833
He's obsessed with--

31
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:48,541
Damn music! What a pain in the neck!

32
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,916
Here we go! He won't give up.

33
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,833
What happened?

34
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,666
Did you fall?

35
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What--

36
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,541
Hey, Saksham! Look what happened to him!

37
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,333
What happened to you?

38
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,458
-Saksham, look what happened to him!
-Grandpa!

39
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,375
-What happened to you?
-Grandpa!

40
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,458
Please, wake up!

41
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,958
It's right here.

42
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,125
-We're here.
-Take the suitcase.

43
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,791
Be careful.

44
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go.

45
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,208
-You remember what I had told you, right?
-Namaste.

46
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,041
You have got my ball, right?
I had told you to pack it.

47
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,333
Keep quiet!

48
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,083
Pankaj is the third brother.

49
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,708
-Isn't the other brother coming?
-The younger son must be on his way.

50
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,916
We've informed him.

51
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,458
Everyone's working now.

52
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,041
-Namaste, Auntie.
-Namaste, Auntie.

53
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,166
Pankaj is here.

54
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,708
Namaste, Uncle.

55
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,333
-Hello, Uncle.
-Hello.

56
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,000
How are you?

57
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,208
-God bless you.
-Come inside.

58
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,625
How are you, son? God bless you.

59
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,166
He's his son.

60
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,708
Namaste.

61
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,166
Dad is no more.

62
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,500
Come on. Give me a hug.

63
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,583
-I'll just go and talk to Mom.
-Sure.

64
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,916
He's gained weight.

65
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,458
-Are you talking about me?
-No, I'm talking about Pankaj.

66
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,666
-Oh.
-He's gained weight.

67
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,583
Yeah.

68
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,666
Brother-in-law has left us, son.

69
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,166
Let's go to that room. Put on your shoes.

70
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,708
-Here.
-Come on, let's go.

71
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,916
-Are you hungry?
-I'll get you something to eat.

72
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,958
He got lucky.

73
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,041
Come on, open it.

74
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,750
-Panditji, will this do?
-Yes.

75
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,916
-Okay, then.
-You should get it checked.

76
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,083
-I think, he's applied some powder.
-It's your old--

77
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,500
-What about the rest of the stuff?
-How many knots am I supposed to tie?

78
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,750
-Tell me!
-Three.

79
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,416
Pankaj… you should have
worn white clothes.

80
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,125
Never mind.

81
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,750
Hasn't Neetu come yet?

82
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,791
His flight got a bit delayed.

83
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,583
He'll get here by 4:00 p.m.

84
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,250
How did you get here?

85
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,916
-By bus.
-Yes!

86
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,541
-Train bookings were full…
-It's right there on top!

87
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,750
Let it be, I'll get it.

88
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,875
…because of the Christmas holidays.

89
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,625
Holiday or no holiday,
getting a train ticket is tough.

90
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,750
We came by taxi.

91
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,833
-By taxi.
-From so far?

92
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:17,833
Let's go.

93
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,375
They got here on time,
that's what matters.

94
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,916
-Uncle, namaste.
-God bless you.

95
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,166
When did you arrive?

96
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,916
I was the first one to arrive.

97
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,708
I set out…
as soon as your mother called.

98
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,666
Let's go. We have to buy some vegetables.

99
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,500
I knew you'd be late.

100
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,583
After all, she's my sister.

101
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,083
-Work is inevitable, right?
-Yes.

102
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,958
Uncle, it's good that you
came, otherwise--

103
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,791
Otherwise?

104
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
It would've been very difficult.

105
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,416
-Right.
-Uncle, you must be tired. Have a seat.

106
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,750
I haven't come here to sit, Gajraj.
There's so much work to be done.

107
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,000
We're here now, Uncle.
Please, get some rest.

108
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,916
What about Neetu? Where is he?
When is he coming?

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,750
I just told you his flight got delayed.
He'll be here soon.

110
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,583
-Yes.
-Is there only one flight from Mumbai?

111
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,875
His father just died.

112
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:20,500
Uncle… he knows that his father just died.
He'll be here soon.

113
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,500
You live nearby, in Raebareli,

114
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,500
-but he's coming from Mumbai.
-Someone, get me water!

115
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,750
-Can't you understand?
-Hey!

116
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,708
Who said--

117
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,791
-Brother-in-law, you're here!
-Please, come.

118
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,333
When did you arrive?

119
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,500
When? I've been sitting
here alone for hours.

120
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,541
I got here before you did.

121
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,708
Yeah, you got here about
seven minutes before me.

122
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,458
-I got here an hour before you.
-Did you hear him?

123
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,083
-We came together.
-You two came at the same time.

124
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, but--

125
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,375
-Neetu is here.
-Neetu is here.

126
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,041
-He's finally here.
-Hey, check it once just to be sure.

127
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,375
He's come alone.

128
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,500
-Namaste, Uncle Neetu.
-His wife didn't come with him.

129
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,416
Let me get that.

130
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,375
It doesn't matter. He's here.
Let him see his mother first.

131
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,541
-I don't want to do it.
-There's no other way, right?

132
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,791
-Let's go, then.
-Where's Mom?

133
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,125
Panditji, be quick.

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,583
Take your shoes off.

135
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,125
Look, your favorite son is here.

136
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,458
Control yourself.

137
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,541
Hey, console your mother.

138
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,416
-Please, control yourself.
-Calm down, Mom.

139
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,041
My son…

140
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,541
Laali, it's getting late.

141
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,958
-Yeah.
-We should go.

142
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,916
-Hurry up!
-Mom.

143
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,750
Dad is no more.

144
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,625
Come on, get up.

145
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,458
Wait. Wait for me.

146
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,791
-Uncle!
-Uncle!

147
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,000
How can he just leave us like that?

148
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,750
-Ramprasad!
-Hey--

149
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,666
-Hey!
-Hey, careful!

150
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,666
-Make him sit down.
-Let me help.

151
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,875
Be careful.

152
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,916
-Why did he come here all the way?
-Does he ever listen?

153
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,708
-Why? Is he hard of hearing?
-No, I didn't mean that.

154
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,291
I want to see his face
for my last memory.

155
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,916
-He does as he pleases.
-Yes.

156
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,875
Oh, okay.

157
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,875
-Namaste.
-Get lost!

158
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,625
-Why are you scolding him?
-I knew the car didn't have enough petrol,

159
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,000
-but he said we'll push it if need be.
-And you brought him here.

160
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,333
Our elder aunt is also here.
She is inside.

161
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,541
-Is she still alive?
-Shut up.

162
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,166
-Panditji!
-Yes?

163
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,625
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.

164
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,083
-Shall we carry him?
-Yes, let's go.

165
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,750
-Uncle, wait a minute. I'll get Mom.
-Okay, go.

166
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,083
Go, get her here.

167
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,208
Mom… it's time.

168
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,541
Let's go.

169
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,208
Come.

170
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,750
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

171
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:45,666
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

172
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:50,416
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

173
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,875
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

174
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:59,416
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

175
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:04,250
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,583
-How big is the house?
-It's huge!

177
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,125
Yes, it's huge!

178
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,791
We're a big family, after all.

179
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,541
We won't fit into a tiny house.

180
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,958
No more kids now.

181
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,333
-But I want more.
-Hey, let go of me! Let go!

182
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,458
Be quiet, all of you!

183
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,458
Listen! Come home early this evening!

184
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,000
We'll have dinner together!
I'll be waiting!

185
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,958
I'll be back soon, Savitri.

186
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:58,208
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

187
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,083
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

188
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,458
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

189
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,666
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

190
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,541
"Lord Ram's name is the truth."

191
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,666
CHADMAL CREMATORIUM

192
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,750
-How much does the wood cost?
-It's 400 rupees a ton.

193
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,125
-Really?
-Yes!

194
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,666
Back in our hometown,
we get it for 200 rupees.

195
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,833
You're right, brother.

196
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,666
Sir, it's the right price.

197
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,333
Who bargains at a crematorium?

198
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,250
What are you--

199
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,041
He's right.
They're waiting for the wood.

200
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,875
He wants 400 rupees a ton.

201
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,375
-What does it matter!
-Who sent him to get the wood!

202
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,125
-Go, Pankaj. Sort it out.
-I'll go.

203
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,375
-Uncle--
-Someone, handle him.

204
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,458
-What's our number?
-Lucky seven.

205
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,500
-Hurry up.
-He's saying it'd cost 400 rupees.

206
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,666
-The day's about to end. Come on.
-Be quick!

207
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,291
-Let's hurry up.
-Why are you bargaining?

208
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,541
Take the dry bits.
Otherwise, it'll take time.

209
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,166
-So what? Do you have to go somewhere?
-Let's go.

210
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,041
-You--
-Ignore him, Uncle. Let it be.

211
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,750
-What's he even saying!
-Come on, let's go.

212
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:41,583
<i>It's time to say goodbye</i>

213
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:56,875
<i>Your soul is about to release</i>
<i>From your body</i>

214
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:07,958
<i>No one knows where you are going</i>

215
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:15,375
<i>No one will recognize your new face</i>

216
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:22,583
<i>You will leave behind</i>
<i>All ties and bonds</i>

217
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,416
<i>O traveler, you'll take the path</i>

218
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,791
<i>You must tread</i>

219
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:40,125
<i>It's time to say goodbye</i>

220
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:51,750
<i>Why must you depart?</i>

221
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,625
Auntie, wait.

222
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,541
Hurry up. I have to take a shower.

223
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,583
Give me some sandalwood.
I need to massage it on my head.

224
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,041
-Go.
-I'm going to take a shower.

225
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,500
Dhaani, tell me something.
Where is Neetu's wife?

226
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,416
She never comes to family occasions.

227
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
But it's her father-in-law's funeral.

228
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,541
We'll ask Neetu whether
she's going to come or no.

229
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,208
Everyone is in mourning.
She is no different, right?

230
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,791
What will she do at home alone?

231
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,916
-Anyway, go and put the mattresses out.
-Sure.

232
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,541
I asked Saksham to play the piano.
He used to love listening to it.

233
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,208
Then, I said it was late
and that he should sleep.

234
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,541
-Then, I went to the kitchen.
-Auntie, are you okay?

235
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,333
Saksham was about to leave…

236
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,375
when he collapsed on the piano.

237
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,416
Oh, no!

238
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,041
I panicked, and I called Saksham.

239
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,416
I asked him to check what happened to him.

240
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,625
He came running, and then…

241
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:54,166
When your own family isn't around,
the outsiders come to your rescue.

242
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,375
True. Neighbors help you in these times.

243
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,041
Sister… don't lose heart.

244
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,666
Be brave, it'll be all right.

245
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,333
I'll make us some tea.

246
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,625
-Sorry, we're troubling you.
-No, not at all. Actually--

247
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,250
-Yes.
-Move the pillow.

248
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,750
I've asked them to get
some rotis, as well.

249
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,083
I'll get it right away.

250
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,750
She's feeling quite cold today.

251
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,583
Look, she's wearing a sweater
as well as a shawl.

252
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,333
I borrowed them from Mother-in-law
as soon as I got here.

253
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,208
-Oh!
-Father-in-law had given it to her…

254
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,750
-Really?
-on her birthday.

255
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,208
Wow!

256
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,875
He had great taste.

257
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,625
He'd given me a lovely pink sari
on Diwali this year.

258
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:39,250
He said, "You should wear bright colors.
They suit you."

259
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,750
He was the only one,
who used to get us gifts.

260
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,750
He knew our likes and dislikes.

261
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,791
He took care of us all.

262
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,875
He must've been very
romantic in his time.

263
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,750
Shut up. You're so cheeky.

264
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,583
How do you think he fathered
an army of six children?

265
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:08,958
Neetu.

266
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,208
Everyone's asleep.

267
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,583
Oh… sorry.

268
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,166
-All good?
-Yes.

269
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,083
Mom, go and lie down.

270
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,875
Yes. Go to sleep.

271
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,583
I'm not feeling sleepy.
If I feel sleepy, I'll lie down here.

272
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,833
Brother has already fallen asleep.

273
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,000
-You should go upstairs and sleep. Go.
-All right.

274
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,333
-Gajraj, sit here for a while.
-Okay.

275
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,541
Don't worry. We'll manage.

276
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,250
Mom, let me massage your feet.

277
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,583
Come on.

278
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,375
He really missed you. All of you.

279
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,291
We wanted to visit you more often,
but how could we? Work kept us busy.

280
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,541
Yes, Mom.

281
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,625
It's not like we didn't miss you and Dad.

282
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,791
Pratibha always talked about
what a nice person he was.

283
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,666
He had a very good heart…

284
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,750
but he was an extremely finicky eater.

285
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,375
No matter what you cook,
he'd always find faults in it.

286
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,125
What are you saying, Pratibha?
He always ate whatever I served him.

287
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,291
I used to argue with Mother-in-law,
but never with Father-in-law.

288
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,416
You know what he used to say to me?

289
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,291
He used to say,
"You're from an affluent family…

290
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,666
so there's a style in everything you do."

291
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,833
He rarely stayed with us.

292
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,416
Later, my husband got so busy
with his work in Ayodhya.

293
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,958
-Yeah, right.
-Oh, really?

294
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,458
I thought, you got fed up with
Mother-in-law's constant nagging.

295
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,583
I'll hit you!

296
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,916
I always wanted to stay here…
but Rahul had important exams then.

297
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,875
How's our brother-in-law, Gajraj?

298
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,166
Does he still drink himself to sleep?

299
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,583
No. He stopped drinking ages ago.

300
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,416
He still drinks.

301
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,416
-Listen, sister-in-law!
-Yes?

302
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,791
-Is our youngest sister-in-law…
-Yes?

303
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,375
coming?

304
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,083
-Where is she?
-I have no idea.

305
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,333
Was our late father-in-law
not up to her standards?

306
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,666
You two are nasty!

307
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,625
Be quiet.

308
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:25,375
Let's go out, or else, the daughters
of this house will bawl us out.

309
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,958
Yes, let's go. They're very dangerous.

310
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,541
-Sister, take the blanket.
-Let's go.

311
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,041
Everything else is fine, right?

312
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,333
Want a drink, Mom?

313
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,333
-Hey… I meant tea.
-All right.

314
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,083
-Do you want tea? We'll get it.
-We can't make it here.

315
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,208
Why not?

316
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,375
-Why can't we have tea? It's so cold.
-Yes, we want some.

317
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,583
We can have tea.
I'll ask Aunt Sheila to make it.

318
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,666
-Why trouble her?
-Why should we bother her?

319
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,416
Mom, can we make it here?

320
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,041
You're not supposed to cook
when in mourning…

321
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,083
but okay, go ahead.

322
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,541
-All right.
-If you're making it, I'll also have some.

323
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,833
-Let me make it then.
-Please, sit down.

324
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,125
Who wants tea?

325
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,541
-Me.
-Me.

326
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,250
Make it for everyone, sister-in-law.

327
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,541
-Add some jaggery in it.
-Yes.

328
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:13,125
Remember how Dad used to love
having tea with jaggery?

329
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,958
If you're making it with jaggery,
I'll also have some.

330
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,000
Serve it in a steel glass.

331
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,791
Can you get me my cough syrup?

332
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,583
-Let's go.
-Where are you all going?

333
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,250
You're going to make tea,
not to exchange chitchat.

334
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,416
-Sushma!
-No, stay here. I'll make it.

335
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,875
-Yes, Mom?
-Use the vessel kept on the top shelf.

336
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,625
The cups are in the cupboard.

337
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,416
Be careful.

338
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,916
Okay, Mom. Will you have tea?

339
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,083
Yes.

340
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,583
-I'll be right back, sister-in-law.
-Go and get the cups.

341
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,291
When did you last see Dad?

342
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,541
Recently. We had come here
with the kids for Diwali.

343
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:53,875
Tell him, Mom.

344
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,958
I had planned to come, but I couldn't.

345
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,333
I had not come here since last one year.

346
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,958
I thought, we'd celebrate
the New Year's together.

347
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,750
That's what happened.
We just kept thinking…

348
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,291
while Mom was alone here.

349
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,041
She had got used to doing everything
on her own since we got married.

350
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:16,458
None of you came and stayed
here for a long period of time.

351
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:21,500
Sister, our kids have schools…
and we have jobs.

352
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:25,000
I know that, Pankaj, but don't your
kids ever get any holidays?

353
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,666
And what about Neetu?
He doesn't even have kids.

354
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,833
-Come on, sister!
-The interrogation's begun.

355
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,416
I know, we were wrong.

356
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,583
There it goes.

357
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,416
-Such a pain in the neck!
-What's with the blackout now?

358
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,791
-Who's this?
-Hey, what happened?

359
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,625
-Go to sleep, child.
-Careful, sister.

360
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:42,875
-Somebody, hold her hand.
-Dear, go and get a candle or a torch.

361
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,416
Brother, did you find our wire?

362
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,041
No, sir. All the wires
have been jumbled up.

363
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,375
Auntie, can you get the <i>poha</i> ready?
I'll come back and cook it.

364
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,375
All right.

365
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,750
Do you want me to peel any
other vegetables than potatoes?

366
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,083
Anything will do.
I'm just making <i>poha.</i>

367
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,500
Sister-in-law, give Sister Rani a towel.

368
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,916
Sure.

369
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,500
Also, can you please wake up the kids?

370
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:11,000
-All right.
-They need to take a shower. It's late.

371
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,875
Sister, please put the mattresses out
to dry! They're smelling really bad!

372
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,083
I'll do it right away.

373
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:17,208
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

374
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:20,375
-Listen! What shall we make for breakfast?
-I'm making <i>poha.</i>

375
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:21,333
Okay.

376
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,916
I end up doing all the housework here.

377
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,541
-Did you take a shower?
-Yes.

378
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:28,458
All right.

379
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,583
I'm going to wake up
your useless brothers.

380
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,541
Good morning, Uncle.

381
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,541
What is this, dear?
You're still making tea.

382
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,458
Have some, Uncle.

383
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,250
It's already so late.
No, I don't want it.

384
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I'll have it.

385
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:42,833
Put it back!

386
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,500
Your brother-in-law
wants to take a shower.

387
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:45,625
-Give me the towel.
-Here.

388
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,125
-Has Gajraj woken up?
-Yes.

389
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,791
He has to attend the prayer meeting.

390
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,416
Panditji is on his way.
Gajraj must be ready before he gets here.

391
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,625
I've given him tea. That's all I know.

392
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,750
-Check if the others are ready!
-That's what I'm doing, sister!

393
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,916
What are you guys doing here?
Sister is hollering downstairs.

394
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,791
-Get ready, and go downstairs!
-We're going.

395
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,541
Hey, Sister Rani!

396
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,083
I can't go to the toilet without this.

397
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:11,458
Even if you have to go,
there's a long queue for it.

398
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:15,291
This family is full of jokers.

399
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,375
That's true.

400
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,208
Who's taking so long to come out?

401
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:22,000
Who else could it be!
Our uncle, who sits inside for an hour.

402
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,041
-Oh.
-I hope he controls himself.

403
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,708
How long are you staying?

404
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,791
I don't know.

405
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,750
What's the plan? I mean…

406
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,375
are you staying until the 13th day ritual

407
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,000
or just until the fourth day ritual?

408
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,625
I don't know what the elders have decided.

409
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,750
Anyway, I've told my colleagues
that my stay might get extended.

410
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,750
But I may have to leave soon.

411
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,625
Isn't Seema coming?

412
00:26:58,708 --> 00:26:59,666
Is that all right?

413
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,041
You know her, right?

414
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,750
What did you tell the family?

415
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,666
I said that she's unwell…

416
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,875
and that she'll come when she gets better.

417
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,208
Good morning, Dad.

418
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,375
Mom will understand,

419
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,416
but sister makes a scene about everything.

420
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,000
She's doing it already.

421
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,958
-Come out.
-Kick the door open!

422
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,750
-Wait, he'll come out!
-Has he fainted in there?

423
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,416
Come out!

424
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,333
Go!

425
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,791
-Hurry up!
-Wait a minute.

426
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,041
-You're always late.
-What?

427
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,000
Must you lag behind
everyone wherever you go?

428
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,583
Hey, brother! Brother!

429
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,208
Help me wash my hands!

430
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:45,958
Go on, help him.

431
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,625
-Hold it down!
-I can't.

432
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,333
You're so weird.

433
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,583
-Uncle!
-Yes?

434
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,500
Are you constipated?

435
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:58,625
Yes. I ate something that
didn't suit my stomach.

436
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,333
You should've told me.
I would have given you a tablet.

437
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,458
I wanted it to go out
of my body naturally.

438
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,958
May he rest in peace.

439
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,041
-Look.
-Brother Manoj is here.

440
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,666
Check this out.

441
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,083
-Good.
-It's lovely.

442
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,083
-Namaste.
-Be careful.

443
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,416
It brings out my brother's personality.

444
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,333
Good.

445
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,083
Be careful.

446
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,416
Mom, Panditji was saying…

447
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,250
that he'll perform the ritual tomorrow.

448
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,375
We have to decide whether we want
a 13-day ritual…

449
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:57,083
or a four-day ritual.

450
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:03,250
My brother is dead
and you want to shortcut the ritual?

451
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,291
Brother,
Mom wants a 13-day ritual.

452
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,708
All right.

453
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,291
Let's do what she wants.

454
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:17,666
Ask him.

455
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,791
-Uncle…
-Yes, dear?

456
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:21,041
Manoj and I are going to Benaras
with Dad's ashes.

457
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:21,958
-Okay.
-Yeah.

458
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:24,916
-No, Gajraj. You cannot go anywhere.
-Why not?

459
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,708
You shaved your head for the ritual.

460
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,458
So, you cannot leave the house.

461
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,208
-Why not?
-Because--

462
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,458
-If he wants to go, he can go.
-What are you saying!

463
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,083
What? Is he supposed to help
the women with peeling the peas?

464
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,833
Peas? You had said we
should eat simple food.

465
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,083
-No--
-No, he doesn't mean that.

466
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,291
Don't get confused.

467
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:47,750
-You should all go. Enjoy the ride.
-Enjoy?

468
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,541
Is this some carnival?

469
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,250
-Everything's upside down in this house.
-You guys are impossible!

470
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,250
I agree.

471
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,958
Uncle, you're like a third umpire.

472
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,166
You tell us to eat simple food,
and then, you say something else.

473
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,083
-Then, you ask us all to go out.
-Listen--

474
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,166
We're talking about going out,
not about eating.

475
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,166
Let's go.

476
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,708
-Take my car.
-Yes, take our car.

477
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:09,833
But--

478
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,625
We'll get a taxi. It's okay.

479
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:14,666
Why? Vinod is telling us to take his car.

480
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,833
It's not Vinod's car. It's my car.

481
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,416
-Right.
-Vinod's just the driver.

482
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,125
Okay, then. You can drive from now onward.

483
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,208
Hey, are you crazy?

484
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,208
He just means that you drive the car,
so he's calling you the driver.

485
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,875
-Sit down.
-I was thinking I should also come.

486
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:31,583
-Uncle, can all four of us go?
-Yes, why not!

487
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,166
After all, we're a family. Take the car.

488
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,166
He said we can't eat green vegetables.
And now, he wants peas.

489
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,541
-Let it go.
-We were talking about the car, brother.

490
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,250
-About the car?
-Yes.

491
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,500
Boys… have you just woken up?

492
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:50,125
You're young.
Don't you go for a run in the morning?

493
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,208
Are we here to mourn or to run?

494
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,416
If you're here to mourn,
you should wake up early.

495
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,958
Grandpa, we slept late.
That's why, we couldn't wake up early.

496
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,458
I didn't sleep the whole
night, yet I am awake.

497
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,208
Why didn't you sleep, Uncle?

498
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:08,000
-Prakash's snoring kept me awake.
-What?

499
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,916
Mom, can we cook today at home?

500
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:16,583
Well, the daughters-in-law can't
cook today… but you daughters can.

501
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,208
-Namaste, sister.
-Namaste, Uncle.

502
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,541
Namaste, Uncle.

503
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,208
Go and take a shower!

504
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,166
-Will you have some tea?
-No, we just had some.

505
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,250
-How did it happen, sister?
-Keep quiet!

506
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,625
Hear the story.

507
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:35,500
He had his dinner.

508
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,875
Then, he asked Saksham
to play the piano.

509
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,875
He was listening to the music.

510
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,083
Then, I said, "It's late, go to sleep."

511
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:48,625
-Then, he--
-Mom, who is going to do the dishes?

512
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,541
-Munni will do it.
-Okay. She'll also make the <i>khichdi</i> then.

513
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:56,750
-Then--
-We'll need extra quilts and mattresses.

514
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,958
Hire them from the tent vendor.

515
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,958
Do you have his number?

516
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,833
It's in the diary.

517
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:13,083
Ask Aunt Sheila.
She'll give you his number. Go.

518
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:19,333
Go to Aunt Sheila's house,
and ask her for the tent vendor's number.

519
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,541
Munni? In a tent?

520
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,666
You're shameless!

521
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:27,583
-Just do what she said!
-Go, get the number. Be quick.

522
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,625
-Brother--
-He collapsed on the piano.

523
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,708
Who is it? Come in.

524
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:34,875
Namaste, Auntie.

525
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,625
-Who is it?
-I'm Samay.

526
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:37,666
-And I'm Rahul.
-Yes.

527
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,750
Oh… come! Sit down!

528
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,500
I didn't recognize you.
You're all grown up.

529
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,208
Bittu!

530
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,458
-Bittu, come here!
-Yes, Mom?

531
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:51,125
Look who's here.

532
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,500
-Hi.
-Hi.

533
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,291
Get them something to eat.

534
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:59,041
What will you have? Tea or a cold drink?

535
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:02,291
No, we're not staying. We need Munni's
number. It gets very cold at night.

536
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,875
He wants the tent vendor's number,
so that he can do the dishes.

537
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,250
What are you saying?

538
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:11,208
You mean, you need Munni's number
so she can do the dishes.

539
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,708
And the vendor's number to hire
quilts and mattresses, right?

540
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,458
-Right.
-That's what we said.

541
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:19,375
Oh, okay. Don't worry.
Bittu will go with you.

542
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,458
Sure, I'll come with you.

543
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,875
There's no need. We'll go on our own.

544
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,708
If it's nearby, we all can go.

545
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,958
We've come here after so long,
we might not remember the way.

546
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,875
Bittu will go with you.

547
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,291
Here we are!

548
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:40,333
Auntie Munni, come to the music
teacher's house from tomorrow.

549
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:41,333
Mom has called you.

550
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,041
Brother, come to the music
teacher's house tomorrow.

551
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:50,625
Isn't he dead?

552
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:53,291
That's why, we're calling you.
Don't forget.

553
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,208
All right.

554
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:56,125
Where are we going now?

555
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,708
-I'll drop you off at home.
-Let's ride around Lucknow.

556
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,583
No, everyone must be waiting.

557
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,958
Oh, shut up. We'll go home eventually.

558
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,541
Let's go for a spin before that.

559
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:08,666
-Is that a problem for you, Bittu?
-Let's go.

560
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,333
-You'll get us thrashed.
-Stop worrying!

561
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:16,166
<i>A faraway wind makes my heart soar</i>

562
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,000
<i>Why do I like the words you speak?</i>

563
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:24,916
<i>Why does everything feel different?</i>

564
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,541
We don't know.

565
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,958
-We don't see it that often.
-This is our uncle.

566
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:31,875
Where were you?

567
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,833
-We had gone to see Munni.
-What?

568
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,458
I meant, we had gone to see the vendor.

569
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,041
You're going to get
thrashed very badly, got it?

570
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,291
-Why?
-I'll tell you before I thrash you.

571
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,833
Get lost! Wash your face!

572
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,125
Go on, get lost!
Send your uncle here!

573
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,125
Here they are! Why are you so late?

574
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:53,166
Just look at you!
Were you swimming in dust?

575
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,750
You'd only sent us to the tent vendor.

576
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:57,250
-Yes, but you're late!
-So what?

577
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,250
He's so insolent!

578
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,666
It's getting late. Hurry up.

579
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,708
The indicator's not working.
Put your hand out.

580
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:04,416
I've been driving this car
since before you were born.

581
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,375
Let's go!

582
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,375
Make sure you do everything properly.

583
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,458
-Hey, Brother Pankaj…
-Why don't you go?

584
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,541
everyone's waiting for you in the car!

585
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:15,166
-Yes, I'm coming. Wait for me.
-Let's go.

586
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,583
How should I get in?

587
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,458
-Right there.
-All right.

588
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,708
-Where are you going?
-Brother!

589
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,416
Let's go. Are you planning
to stay here tonight?

590
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,083
I taught you how to drive.

591
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,875
-Why are you driving so slowly?
-Sorry, brother.

592
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,583
<i>Yes?</i>

593
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:10,083
<i>So, when will you get here?</i>

594
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,166
<i>Okay. I'll let them know.</i>

595
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:14,416
What happened?

596
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,041
The car broke down. They won't be
back before tomorrow afternoon.

597
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:21,041
-Oh, no!
-What a nuisance!

598
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,166
I knew this would happen.
That car's a wreck.

599
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:27,458
Where will they stay tonight? Now,
we have one more thing to worry about.

600
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:29,666
Brother…

601
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,583
you started smoking when
you were young, right?

602
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,125
Yes! I remember, I was very young…

603
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:41,416
and when I first saw him smoke,
I got scared.

604
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,083
-Oh.
-I thought, his mouth was on fire.

605
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:49,750
-He's got thrashed many times.
-Yes.

606
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,166
How, brother?

607
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,416
Nothing. I was just puffing away…

608
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:00,166
when someone came from behind
and said, "Give me a light."

609
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,750
I turned back, and it was Dad.

610
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,958
I got whacked on the spot.

611
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:06,166
No, I'm not talking about that story.

612
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,875
Once, he had talked back to Dad.

613
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,166
He said, "Why are you scolding me?

614
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,291
I've seen you and Mom sleeping naked."

615
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,666
Say what you want, but I'm the eldest.

616
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,166
-Of course!
-You're all like my children.

617
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:27,500
I've seen Mom and Dad very closely.

618
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,500
Often, I have seen them naked.

619
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:35,041
-Not once, several times!
-Brother, let's call it a night.

620
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,000
No matter how much our father--

621
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,166
Don't make such a racket!
The others are sleeping.

622
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,916
-Yes.
-Sorry, brother.

623
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,916
Sorry.

624
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,041
-Speak softly.
-Dad was a great man…

625
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,625
but what did he do for us?

626
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:54,083
Nothing. Music was all he cared about.

627
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,083
And our mother…

628
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:00,125
she's a very cunning lady.

629
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:04,708
She turned our dad against me,
and had me thrashed.

630
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,458
-Enough, brother.
-Neetu, let him speak.

631
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,791
A man shouldn't keep things bottled up.
It causes heartache.

632
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,416
We're talking so openly
to each other for the first time.

633
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:15,541
Look at me.

634
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,583
Brother Gajraj,
whatever I've tried to do until now…

635
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,541
has always failed miserably.

636
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,666
-Pour me another.
-Look at me.

637
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,125
It's been tough for me to make ends meet,

638
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,708
but have any of you…

639
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:34,291
ever asked me, "Manoj,
are you able to manage everything?"

640
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:38,333
When I was born,
I was considered the lucky one.

641
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,041
Remember, you used to say…

642
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,125
"His birth has brought us luck.
We own a shop now.

643
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,916
He's lucky, he's very lucky."

644
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,291
The shop…

645
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,000
Dad said that shop was his dream.

646
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:56,416
My shop's the real deal.
My in-laws helped me run it.

647
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:01,375
I respect them because they respect me.

648
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,750
My in-laws are useless.

649
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,416
No, our parents were useless. Right?

650
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:09,708
They kept complaining
that we never visit them.

651
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:12,958
But tell me something, did they
ever step foot outside their home?

652
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:15,125
Neetu, you're doing fine.

653
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:19,083
You're the youngest.
You're everyone's favorite.

654
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:22,500
You always do whatever you want.

655
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,291
-Maybe.
-Your wife listens to you.

656
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,958
You even have dimples.

657
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,125
And you…

658
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:35,208
you used to sing really well, dear.

659
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:39,333
-Why did you stop singing?
-Right. You're the best singer in Lucknow.

660
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:41,750
-Yes!
-Sing us a song.

661
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:46,416
-No, brother--
-Go on, sing for us. We rarely meet.

662
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,166
I've stopped singing.

663
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,666
Sing us a song, or else, I'll do it.

664
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:56,291
What was the song that Dad used to sing?

665
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:59,625
"I will take you around the world."

666
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:01,125
-Yes.
-What was its tune?

667
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,083
I know.

668
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,375
He used to count to four.

669
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,541
Yes, I remember.

670
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,125
<i>There's an unfinished task</i>

671
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:24,291
<i>That I want you to finish</i>

672
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:30,333
<i>Today, I'll explain to you</i>
<i>What life is all about</i>

673
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:35,625
<i>It's a beautiful, deep secret</i>

674
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
<i>I'll tell you all about it</i>

675
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:43,291
<i>Do you see that village far ahead?</i>

676
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:47,250
<i>Today, I'll give you a tour of it</i>

677
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:57,000
<i>The darkness of the night</i>

678
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,875
<i>Descends on time</i>

679
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:04,833
<i>What you hold in your hand</i>

680
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,291
<i>Is all you'll take with you</i>

681
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,625
<i>On days like these</i>

682
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:15,375
<i>I will teach you how to walk</i>

683
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:20,125
<i>There's an unfinished task</i>

684
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:23,541
<i>That I want you to finish</i>

685
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:27,958
<i>I will make you sit by my side</i>

686
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:31,416
<i>And explain the tune to you</i>

687
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,833
-All together!
-All together!

688
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,291
<i>It's like a drop of water</i>

689
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:02,500
<i>Granny used to say</i>
<i>"Let me hear you sing!"</i>

690
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,666
<i>Tell me the story</i>

691
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,916
<i>Of the king and the queen again</i>

692
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:17,791
<i>Let me hear it again</i>

693
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,375
<i>Grandpa used to say</i>

694
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:29,541
<i>"Take me for a ride</i>
<i>On the rocking horse!"</i>

695
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:33,750
<i>Do you see that village far ahead?</i>

696
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:37,041
<i>Give us a tour of it today</i>

697
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:41,458
<i>Tell us the story</i>

698
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:45,416
<i>Again today</i>

699
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,875
<i>Give me those blue marbles</i>

700
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,416
<i>Of memories again</i>

701
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:13,458
<i>Let me fly that kite</i>

702
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,500
<i>Of my childhood again</i>

703
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,083
<i>Make me finish the unfinished task</i>

704
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:24,833
<i>That you wanted me to finish</i>

705
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:29,583
<i>Make us finish the unfinished task</i>

706
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:33,958
<i>That you wanted us to finish</i>

707
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,916
I have diabetes. I don't want tea.

708
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,500
Namaste.

709
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,375
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

710
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:05,291
That's my uncle and aunt.

711
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,125
Sister…

712
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,166
I hope she doesn't ask,
"How did it happen?"

713
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:11,708
…how did it happen?

714
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:20,291
He had his dinner.
Then, he asked Saksham to play the piano.

715
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,916
You'll get us killed.

716
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:25,833
Hey, what happened?

717
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,791
You guys are shameless!

718
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,583
I'm not making fun of anyone.

719
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:32,791
Poor Grandma repeats
the same thing again and again.

720
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,250
What choice does she have?

721
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:36,958
Everyone who comes here
asks her the same question.

722
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:39,916
What else can they ask
in these circumstances?

723
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,750
We should print a leaflet with
details of how Grandpa died.

724
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:46,250
"This is what happened,
this is how it happened."

725
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:48,291
Sister Paakhi, today is Sunday.

726
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:50,791
There comes a cartoon film on
TV on Sunday. Can we watch it?

727
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:53,083
No, we can't put on the TV in this house.

728
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:56,916
But we can watch it in
the neighbor's house.

729
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,583
-At Bittu's.
-Oh, really?

730
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:03,125
The kids won't be able to enjoy it alone.
So, we should also go with them.

731
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,791
-Right! Let's go!
-Get a permission from the elders first.

732
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,791
Forget them! They'll say no.

733
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,666
-Let's go.
-They'll make a scene.

734
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,083
You're going to get in trouble, anyway.
Aren't you supposed to go to the airport?

735
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,083
Instead of doing that,
you're busy in chitchat!

736
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,041
You're doomed!

737
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:18,083
-Oh, no!
-Aunt Seema is coming! Let's go!

738
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,375
Let's go quickly.

739
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:23,666
-Hey, watch where you're going!
-Oh, sorry!

740
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,250
-Such insolent boys!
-Hey, let's go!

741
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,833
Hey, please don't mind. They're just kids.

742
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,750
Tell Nishant not to worry.

743
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:36,458
It's okay even if his in-laws don't come.

744
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,958
-Everyone else is here.
-All right.

745
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:42,666
-Why aren't they coming?
-They're big shots.

746
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,458
Bigger than me?

747
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,500
-Not agewise, Auntie. Statuswise.
-Are they so educated?

748
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,458
Auntie, listen to the devotional song.

749
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,833
-Pankaj, Neetu, come over here.
-Yes.

750
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,666
Wait a minute.

751
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:58,500
Panditji! We're supposed to write
just five letters, right?

752
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:01,375
-Yes.
-No one writes letters anymore.

753
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,041
It's the era of SMS.

754
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:05,416
Even if it's an SMS,
you have to type it.

755
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Read its content.

756
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:08,875
Brother-in-law, come forward.

757
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:11,250
-Help us compose the message.
-I'm all ears. Go on.

758
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,333
Hey, come on! Help them!

759
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:14,791
-Brother Manoj, read it out.
-Yes.

760
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:19,458
"We deeply regret to inform
you that our father…

761
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:23,833
Mr. Ramprasad Bhargava
passed away on 19th December.

762
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,416
The final day of mourning
is on 1st January--"

763
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,250
-What… 1st January?
-There he goes.

764
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,708
-No one will come on 1st January.
-Why not?

765
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,750
Brother Gajraj is right.

766
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,291
-Let's keep it on 2nd January.
-What?

767
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,958
-We can even keep it on 31st December.
-How can we do that?

768
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:46,500
-That won't make it 13 days.
-Everyone parties on 31st December.

769
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:49,583
We can't start others' new year
with the 13th day ritual, right?

770
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:52,583
Are we supposed to consider
their happiness or our grief?

771
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:57,625
What's the problem?
Keep it on the tenth day.

772
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,833
Those who love you,
will definitely come.

773
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:02,750
-What!
-That's nonsense.

774
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,875
According to you,
I always talk nonsense.

775
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,791
-Yes--
-You think I'm a fool!

776
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:12,375
When you were in school, you had revised
geography chapters for a history test.

777
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,458
-You had messed up the entire test.
-What about you?

778
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,291
For the home economics class,
she had to do some cooking.

779
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:21,708
Instead of adding salt,
she added soda and ruined everything.

780
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:23,208
It was delicious!

781
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:27,375
-Come to the point.
-Wait. Leave the space for the date blank.

782
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,791
-We'll decide it later.
-Why later, Gajraj? Let's decide now.

783
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:31,750
But sister--

784
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,375
-Panditji.
-Tell him.

785
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,041
-Make it 1st January.
-As you please.

786
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,625
-It's settled.
-But--

787
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:39,458
What do you mean?

788
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,750
Think about it. Once the date is
fixed, it can't be changed.

789
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,291
-Do as Manoj says. He's an elder.
-Have you lost it? I'm the eldest!

790
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:51,333
Calm down. Why are you making a scene?

791
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:54,708
Don't you know the sequence
of the alphabets? "M" comes after "G."

792
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:58,875
Mr. Prakash…
every family follows its own rituals.

793
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:03,625
Mr. Ramprasad was a great believer in
tradition. He was your father-in-law.

794
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:07,125
Is this how you discuss his rituals?

795
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:11,166
What are we doing wrong, Uncle?
We're following the tradition.

796
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,125
Is this the way to talk to me?

797
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:17,041
Uncle is right.
Let's do it the way he's suggesting.

798
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:19,541
-Don't do it my way!
-We will do it your way.

799
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:23,125
You'll have to tolerate me
until my sister is alive!

800
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:26,541
-We can part ways later!
-Uncle, come with me.

801
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:28,416
No, listen to me…

802
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,250
No one understands a thing here!

803
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,375
Brother, listen to me!

804
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:33,666
-What happened?
-Brother Gajraj!

805
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,875
Aunt Seema is here!

806
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,583
Uncle, Auntie has arrived!

807
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,375
-Namaste, Auntie!
-Tear an end of the letter

808
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:41,375
before sending it.

809
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,666
-Should I tear it?
-Yes.

810
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:43,666
All right.

811
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:45,666
Auntie, give it to me.

812
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,000
She is an actress.

813
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,666
Just tear the corners of the letters.

814
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:55,375
-Mom, isn't she an actress?
-The corners… yes!

815
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,958
Hi, Seema! Seema's here!

816
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:00,416
-After that, just post them!
-Seema!

817
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,458
-How are you, Seema?
-How are you?

818
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:06,333
-I am so glad you came.
-Finally, you're here.

819
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,833
Is she the youngest daughter-in-law?

820
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,958
She's rude!
She didn't pay her respects!

821
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:12,541
Never mind, Auntie.

822
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:49,541
You mustn't stop until you learn
to play a musical instrument properly.

823
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,666
You must respect it.

824
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,416
Mom.

825
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,875
What's wrong, Mom?

826
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,666
Are you missing Dad?

827
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:17,166
Everyone's sleeping.
Let's go to the courtyard and talk.

828
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,708
Come.

829
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,500
Mom, did anyone hurt you?

830
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,958
They're all crazy.
Don't pay attention to them.

831
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,083
What happened? Tell me.

832
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,458
I don't understand, Dhaani.

833
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,916
I wanted us all to live together.

834
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:44,125
All my children,
daughters-in-law and grandchildren.

835
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:51,750
And now that we're together…
I am feeling so lonely.

836
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:52,958
Mom…

837
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,916
You're going to stay here
until the 13th day, right?

838
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:03,166
Yes, Mom. We're going to be here.

839
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,000
Whom are you going to stay with now?
Have you decided?

840
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:14,083
Mom, you can't live here alone.

841
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,125
Tell me something.

842
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:24,250
Is everything okay
between Nishant and Seema?

843
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:25,916
Speak softly. She's here.

844
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:30,416
Is there any problem
between Nishant and Seema?

845
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,333
Looks like it.

846
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,083
She seems distant.

847
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,250
She never got along with us.

848
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,000
Never mind, Mom.
It has always been like that.

849
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:48,583
She moved to Mumbai to become an actress.
Did she make it? No.

850
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:51,625
Have you ever seen her on TV?
Or in a film? No.

851
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,625
She lives off her brother's fame.

852
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:56,708
Her brother's nice.

853
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:59,000
Nice? He's an actor.

854
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,291
He's good at pretending.

855
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:05,083
Never mind.

856
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,500
Let's go inside. It's getting cold.

857
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:12,125
-Let's go.
-Come on.

858
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:14,500
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

859
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:18,666
-You go ahead. I'll go to the washroom.
-Careful.

860
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,041
Careful.

861
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:24,625
-Let's go down this way.
-Why this way?

862
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:27,916
-Dad had fallen down these stairs twice.
-Yes, I remember.

863
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,916
-Nothing had happened to him then.
-Watch your step, brother.

864
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,583
-Careful!
-This long dhoti…

865
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:39,333
Why are you getting down backward?

866
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:42,333
This is how you go downstairs…

867
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:48,291
-if you're wearing a dhoti.
-Careful.

868
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:51,958
-Did you see how smoothly I came down?
-Yes, awesome!

869
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,208
-Speak softly, you'll wake up Mom.
-Oh, right.

870
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:58,166
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

871
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,375
Hey, this way.

872
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:05,791
-Where's Neetu? I didn't see him today.
-That's because Seema is here now.

873
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,750
I see!

874
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,416
-He must be busy.
-Speak softly, or else, Mom will wake up.

875
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:26,833
-We won't tell anyone.
-Keep quiet. Everyone's asleep.

876
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:29,541
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

877
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:10,291
Sister, look. They match perfectly.

878
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,500
Let's go inside.

879
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:16,500
-How is it?
-The ghee you've ordered is perfect.

880
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,541
-After all, it's my choice.
-The <i>laddoos</i> smell delicious.

881
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,666
The <i>kachoris</i> should
also be fried in ghee.

882
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,333
-Right.
-What is it, Uncle?

883
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:26,000
-Are the <i>kachoris</i> ready?
-Don't worry, they're frying them.

884
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:28,375
No, I am not worrying.
Just add some pulses into them.

885
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,458
Don't worry. You'll love it.

886
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:32,041
Why are you discussing all this here?

887
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:37,291
Is this a funeral or a wedding?
The food needs to be simple.

888
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,583
Make it bland, then.

889
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:43,250
-You twist everything I say.
-No, I know it's for the 13th day ritual,

890
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,791
but people must like it.
The food must be tasty.

891
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,541
The rice is full of stones.

892
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:50,500
Let me make the tea.

893
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,125
The tea's ready.

894
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,000
Make some for yourself if you want.

895
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,041
I can't make tea without
milk the way you do.

896
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,041
I'll make it later.

897
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:00,625
Let me serve it.

898
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,125
-Why is she so keen on helping today?
-There are guests, that's why.

899
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,791
She wants to show off her talent.
She's an actress, after all.

900
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,458
You're wicked.

901
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,458
Sister-in-law,
can you please pass the water jug?

902
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:17,125
-It must be there.
-I just filled it.

903
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,250
Thank you.

904
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,541
I wanted to talk to you about something.

905
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,375
Mom was weeping last night.

906
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,291
She must be missing Dad.

907
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,833
Yes… she's the only one who misses him.
I think we don't miss him.

908
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:38,041
What are you saying?
You're taking this the wrong way.

909
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:41,541
-We were just laughing--
-No, that's okay.

910
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,541
I'm talking about what I'm seeing
in this house.

911
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:46,500
What do you mean?
Speak more clearly.

912
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:51,500
The truth is that
Mom cannot live here alone.

913
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:56,833
So, let's decide whether you'll stay here
or take her along with you.

914
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:02,708
How can we decide that?

915
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:06,083
Mom should tell us what she wants to do.

916
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,750
Mom won't be able to do that.

917
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,083
I'll be right back.

918
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:17,625
How could she say that!
It's between Mom and her sons, right?

919
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,500
Who are we to decide?

920
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:22,041
You're right.
Who wants to open a Pandora's box, anyway!

921
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,500
The Pandora's box has been opened!

922
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,958
-It's gone.
-Hey, Auntie!

923
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,041
Seema!

924
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:50,291
Seema.

925
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,708
-What happened?
-Nothing.

926
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,208
Then, why did you walk away from there?

927
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,541
-Did we say something wrong?
-No.

928
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:58,750
Then, what happened?

929
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:04,500
If you don't like me, be honest…
but don't make fun of me.

930
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:09,500
-Who was making fun of you?
-Am I a child? Can't I tell?

931
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,625
You're always gossiping about me!

932
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:17,291
Are you crazy? We don't gossip about
you at all. Dhaani was scolding us.

933
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:19,791
-That's why, we kept quiet.
-Why are you lying?

934
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,583
When I was serving tea, you were
smirking as though I am an outsider.

935
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:24,500
Seema--

936
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:28,458
I'm trying to fit in,
but no one really wants me to do that.

937
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,166
Speak softly.

938
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,375
Look! When Father-in-law was sick,
I told Nishant to send him some money.

939
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:37,583
I thought you all have responsibilities,
so you won't be able to help.

940
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,958
-Look, Seema--
-It was not that easy for us either…

941
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,500
but we helped.

942
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,916
Did anyone thank me for that?

943
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,666
Look, this isn't the right
time for this talk.

944
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,958
Whenever you need money,
you think of us.

945
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,625
Hey, what are you saying?

946
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:54,000
Who begged you for money?

947
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:58,083
I agree, we once took 25,000 rupees
from you for Rahul's school admission…

948
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,250
but we returned it!

949
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:03,416
You returned it, but Brother Pankaj
swallowed 50,000 from us!

950
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,458
I don't know about that!

951
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,500
That's between you two.
We've cleared our debts.

952
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:11,041
Yeah, right.

953
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:14,000
Do as you please, but keep me out of it!

954
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,750
I'm already worried.

955
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:19,000
Go and take a shower, or do you want
to remain filthy like your father?

956
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,166
Look, I've been facing some financial
difficulties since past four years.

957
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:33,125
So, I thought the rent from Dad's shop
might help.

958
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,875
He always said I was lucky for the shop…

959
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:38,583
but he got sick,
so I couldn't say anything.

960
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:42,125
-Calm down.
-Why? Do you think I'm drunk?

961
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:43,166
Yes, you are drunk.

962
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,833
I'm not drunk, Brother Manoj.
I'm hurt. That's it.

963
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:53,666
I've been humiliated in front of everyone
for mere 50,000 rupees.

964
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:56,791
Brother Pankaj,
no one has humiliated you.

965
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:59,208
I don't even know about all this.

966
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:01,041
Sit down.

967
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,458
-Let's call Seema, and ask her.
-Forget it.

968
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,875
Speak softly.
They can hear you downstairs.

969
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,250
People enjoy conflicts, anyway.

970
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:12,583
Don't add fuel to the fire.

971
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,250
Who's adding fuel to the fire?

972
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:16,708
-Are you talking to me?
-Speak softly, brother.

973
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:21,541
Tell me something…
who brought up this topic?

974
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,500
Seema.

975
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,333
She said it to my face.

976
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,208
No one cares for anyone here.

977
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:34,416
I didn't say a word because…

978
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:36,916
I'm neither the youngest nor the eldest.

979
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,500
I was born as the middle
child, by mistake.

980
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:42,541
Me, too.

981
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:46,208
Eldest sibling gives advice…
while the youngest sibling gets pampered.

982
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,625
What about me?
I'm just stuck in the middle.

983
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:52,458
I am useless!

984
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,375
-Why are you--
-They tease me saying that…

985
00:59:57,458 --> 01:00:00,583
I belong to my wife's family now.

986
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,125
-Let him say it!
-Yes, I belong to my wife's family.

987
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:05,666
Don't think like that.

988
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:08,041
Keep it down.

989
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,875
-Uncle, let's go downstairs.
-Let's go.

990
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:26,083
We'll just clean this, and join you.

991
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,000
Did he urinate here?

992
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,125
-I'll clean it.
-Should I help you?

993
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:44,791
Seema, can you serve the tea?

994
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:48,958
Here.

995
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,666
Who wants to handle her mood
swings, anyway!

996
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:54,375
Forget it now, Seema!

997
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,166
Just remember why you're here!

998
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:59,333
We can sort the grievances later.

999
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:01,083
We won't meet again anytime soon.

1000
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:03,416
Mom is going to live a long life.

1001
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:09,416
What did she say?

1002
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,250
Keep quiet.
People get what they deserve.

1003
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:14,166
Why talk like that about Mom?

1004
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,458
Why? It's not like Mom's an angel.

1005
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,916
She cursed Dad all her life.
Then, why is she grieving now?

1006
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,250
-Don't say that.
-Don't we fight with our husbands?

1007
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,625
What are you saying?

1008
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,083
Of course, you'll defend Mom.

1009
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:30,875
You always got what you wanted, after all.

1010
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,166
-Sister--
-Everyone turned a blind eye toward me.

1011
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,875
It's not the time to discuss all this.

1012
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:38,041
I was so young when it all happened.

1013
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,791
-I don't even remember.
-Yeah, right. I grew up too soon.

1014
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:45,583
I was 16 years old. I wasn't allowed
to study or train for any job.

1015
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:47,875
They just married me off.

1016
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,333
She's right.

1017
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,708
Yes, but things were different then.

1018
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:55,250
No one knew your husband
didn't have a steady job.

1019
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,583
They knew. Mom knew everything.

1020
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:01,416
She just wanted
to get rid of us, one by one.

1021
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,791
Speak softly.
If Mom overhears us, how would she feel?

1022
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:09,333
Whether you agree or not,
your husband loves you a lot.

1023
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,708
Love, my foot!

1024
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:14,083
He lied about his job, so obviously,
he'd pretend that he loves me.

1025
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:18,458
I've always had to entreat my
parents to fulfill my wishes.

1026
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:20,208
It's okay to ask for help from our family.

1027
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:22,875
No, Pratibha!
I got an earful about it in return!

1028
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,500
What was I supposed to do?
Whom should I have asked for help?

1029
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,750
Tell me, has anyone ever respected
my husband in this house?

1030
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:33,291
Whatever may be the occasion,
he's made to work the hardest.

1031
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,458
But that didn't make any difference!
They still complained about him!

1032
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:40,541
Sister, no one's complaining.
Don't say this.

1033
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,041
Everyone respects him.

1034
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:45,708
Forget it!
I see how everyone respects him!

1035
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:48,208
Everyone's always in a bad mood.

1036
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,416
Move!

1037
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:58,125
She always enters at the right time.

1038
01:02:59,958 --> 01:03:00,791
Please, come.

1039
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:19,833
Sister-in-law, this is Mr. Awasthi.
He works at your bank.

1040
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:27,875
I was very sad to hear…
about your husband.

1041
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:32,166
After all, no one can interfere
with the God's will.

1042
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,791
This isn't the right time…

1043
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:39,458
but I have to say this. A few years ago,
your husband had taken a loan.

1044
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,875
Initially, the monthly
installments were paid on time…

1045
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:47,541
but then, they stopped.
The bank even served him a notice.

1046
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:49,708
Now that the interest
rate is going to increase,

1047
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:52,333
the repayments will also be higher.

1048
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:57,208
There's enough money in
his account for this month.

1049
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:02,375
You two have a joint account,
so I'll need your signature.

1050
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,250
I don't understand all this.

1051
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:09,750
-Can you please talk to my son, Manoj?
-Sure, I had met him once.

1052
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,208
-What's the amount of loan?
-Well--

1053
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:16,791
Wait! Sir, let's talk outside.

1054
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:19,666
Uncle, I also need
a loan for a motorcycle.

1055
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,583
Shut up.

1056
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,000
Please, come.

1057
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,416
Brother Gajraj,
Dad took a loan of a million rupees!

1058
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,958
He only returned three lakhs.
Seven lakhs are still remaining.

1059
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,500
-Eight, not seven.
-How?

1060
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,208
Interest of a lakh rupees.

1061
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,625
-Oh, no--
-He also mortgaged the shop.

1062
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,750
-What are you saying?
-Yes, I'm telling the truth.

1063
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,541
But what did he need this loan for?

1064
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:44,416
We all must discuss this. Not just
us brothers, but our sisters as well.

1065
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:47,625
He might have taken the loan for them.

1066
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:50,875
I had also borrowed money from
him, but I returned it immediately.

1067
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:54,333
Well, we all have borrowed
money from Dad at some point.

1068
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:55,708
I haven't.

1069
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,291
You have no responsibilities.

1070
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,000
-Stop it!
-What?

1071
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:02,250
As if you have heaps of responsibilities.

1072
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,541
-Of course, I have responsibilities.
-You take money from your in-laws.

1073
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:06,208
Responsibilities, my foot!

1074
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:09,666
-I'll talk to Mom.
-Let's do it right now.

1075
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,833
Now? She must be asleep.

1076
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:13,958
Too many people visit us during the day.

1077
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:16,583
On top of that, our uncle keeps
poking his nose in our business.

1078
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,833
You rascal!
You're always picking on him.

1079
01:05:22,916 --> 01:05:28,250
-You've pampered him too much. Let's go.
-You're going too far.

1080
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:29,166
Let's go.

1081
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,250
-Where is he going now?
-Dad had fallen down these stairs twice.

1082
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,166
-Let's go down from that side.
-Come.

1083
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,375
Come. Walk straight.

1084
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:39,583
What is it?

1085
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:41,958
-Dhaani, is Mom asleep?
-Yes.

1086
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,708
-Wake her up. We want to talk to her.
-She's asleep.

1087
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:46,958
-Switch on the lights.
-Why are you--

1088
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:48,208
What's happening?

1089
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:54,958
Mom.

1090
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:57,166
Sit down.

1091
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,041
Sit down.

1092
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,000
-Everyone's here.
-What's wrong?

1093
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:06,208
-Nothing.
-What is it?

1094
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,333
What happened?

1095
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:16,875
Tell me.

1096
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:28,666
Mom… we wanted to know why
Dad took such a big loan.

1097
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:36,875
I mean… why did he need so much money?

1098
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,416
Tell them, Mom, why he needed the money.

1099
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,375
They'd never come to discuss
anything with you before today.

1100
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:47,791
What!

1101
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:51,291
Now that they found out about the loan,
they're all over you.

1102
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:52,791
Go ahead, blame me.

1103
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,791
I've always been
the needy one in this family.

1104
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:58,291
-Sister, we're not talking about you.
-Why are you--

1105
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,875
Are you talking about me then?

1106
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:03,791
-Be quiet, Uncle's asleep.
-Don't start now.

1107
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,875
Dhaani… get me Dad's diary.

1108
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,708
-His diary?
-Yes.

1109
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:14,541
Yes, that's the one.

1110
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:15,833
What's in it, Mom?

1111
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,958
Here.

1112
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:21,291
Yes, that's Dad's diary.

1113
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,625
Had he taken any more loans?

1114
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,041
-He must have mentioned why he took it.
-What's written in there, brother?

1115
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:34,625
FINAL TALLIES

1116
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:38,625
The tallies.

1117
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:41,333
-What?
-Read it.

1118
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:47,541
"On 23rd June 2013,
I gave 125,000 to Manoj."

1119
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:50,500
-Yes, but we'd returned it.
-We had returned it.

1120
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,416
-You'd returned 75,000.
-Did you hear that?

1121
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:53,625
Only 75,000?

1122
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:57,833
"On 4th June 2013,
I gave 35,000 to Rani's husband."

1123
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,958
We didn't even ask for it.
Mom forced it on us.

1124
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:04,666
Sister, I'm just reading what's
written here. No one's blaming you.

1125
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:09,666
"On 5th July 2013, I had given them
30,000. They haven't returned it."

1126
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:14,125
"Once, I gave 20,000 to Gajraj.
He returned it."

1127
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,125
-That's what he's written.
-We had returned all of it.

1128
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:18,041
What about 50,000--

1129
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:20,208
-"Pankaj took 75,000."
-We'd returned it.

1130
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:23,750
"In 2013, 50,000.
In 2014, another 75,000."

1131
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,250
But we had returned all of it.

1132
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:27,500
-Oh, you returned it.
-How much did you return?

1133
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:29,291
I guess, 30,000.

1134
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:32,125
You've returned just 60,000.

1135
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,833
You'd borrowed 25,000
for your brother-in-law's

1136
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:36,458
-daughter's wedding.
-Mom, where are you going?

1137
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:38,791
-Why would I do that?
-It's all written here.

1138
01:10:01,116 --> 01:10:02,700
Tell me if you need anything.

1139
01:10:02,783 --> 01:10:05,408
-What is all this?
-What's your problem?

1140
01:10:18,283 --> 01:10:23,116
Saksham was about
to leave, and right then…

1141
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:36,866
he collapsed on the piano.

1142
01:10:37,825 --> 01:10:40,825
I called Saksham.
I was so scared.

1143
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:43,991
I asked him to see what had happened.

1144
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:47,866
He just left us.

1145
01:10:49,533 --> 01:10:52,116
Grandma, why are you crying?

1146
01:10:52,866 --> 01:10:55,033
Come here, dear.

1147
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,533
-Please, have something.
-I don't want to eat!

1148
01:10:59,825 --> 01:11:02,700
I've been eating this bland
food for five days now!

1149
01:11:03,075 --> 01:11:05,783
-Here.
-It's tasteless! How can I eat it!

1150
01:11:05,866 --> 01:11:07,450
-Auntie, take this.
-I don't want to eat!

1151
01:11:07,533 --> 01:11:08,991
-Grandma…
-She doesn't want to eat.

1152
01:11:09,075 --> 01:11:11,866
put your dentures in.
I'll order a pizza for you.

1153
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,908
Go to hell!

1154
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:26,533
Even if we manage to save 100,000
each, it still won't be enough.

1155
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,700
From where we're supposed
to get even 100,000?

1156
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,658
We barely cover our monthly expenses.

1157
01:11:32,741 --> 01:11:35,908
How are you dividing the loan, brother?

1158
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:38,616
Everyone must return what they owe.

1159
01:11:39,575 --> 01:11:43,616
What about the interest?
We need to pay that as well.

1160
01:11:45,783 --> 01:11:46,741
Okay, then.

1161
01:11:47,866 --> 01:11:48,825
Let's sell the shop.

1162
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,658
Why are you after the shop?

1163
01:11:53,658 --> 01:11:56,366
Anyway, we can't sell it.
It's been mortgaged.

1164
01:11:57,491 --> 01:12:00,616
Brother, if we keep the shop, it'll
be of some use in such times of need.

1165
01:12:00,908 --> 01:12:04,408
You should've let me run it.
I would've made it work.

1166
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,116
-Yes, but--
-You simply mortgaged it.

1167
01:12:06,533 --> 01:12:10,533
As if you could have made it work!

1168
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,991
Let's sell the house, then.

1169
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,158
The house?

1170
01:12:14,366 --> 01:12:15,783
-Which house? This one?
-Here's tea.

1171
01:12:16,616 --> 01:12:18,616
Put it down.

1172
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:21,950
Why did you sit down?
You'd better go.

1173
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:23,866
What will I do downstairs?

1174
01:12:24,116 --> 01:12:26,116
-They're quarreling.
-Who's quarreling?

1175
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,575
Well… there's only one
conflict in this house.

1176
01:12:37,616 --> 01:12:39,241
-Okay.
-I'm better than you all.

1177
01:12:39,325 --> 01:12:41,908
You think I'm bad because
I cut ties with the family…

1178
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,075
-but I didn't land the family in debt.
-Seema, keep quiet!

1179
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:49,116
What's wrong with you? You're
always creating trouble! Enough now!

1180
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:53,075
If you can't be polite,
then at least, stop fighting.

1181
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:56,366
Brother Neetu, please go. We'll handle it.

1182
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:58,616
-Don't get involved in their quarrels.
-Come on, go.

1183
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,200
-It's late. You should sleep.
-Right.

1184
01:13:00,283 --> 01:13:01,408
Drop it.

1185
01:13:01,741 --> 01:13:02,741
Let's go.

1186
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:09,200
Seema, don't make a scene.

1187
01:13:09,283 --> 01:13:12,658
There are guests here.
Don't shame the family.

1188
01:13:12,908 --> 01:13:15,241
We'll talk when they leave.

1189
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:18,616
Why? Are you scared of the outsiders?
Tell me.

1190
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:20,991
Carry on with your charade later.

1191
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:23,533
Tell me, who's really bothered
about Dad's loan?

1192
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,866
You're just worried about saving
your own money.

1193
01:13:26,616 --> 01:13:28,533
Don't even get me started.

1194
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,325
I can say the same thing, Seema!

1195
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:33,283
If I started talking, you'd be in trouble.

1196
01:13:33,783 --> 01:13:37,450
-What have I done?
-Drop it. Don't act so innocent.

1197
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,658
As if you don't know what
happened to Brother Neetu.

1198
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:44,491
Let it be. Everyone knows
why Brother Neetu had to get a job.

1199
01:13:44,658 --> 01:13:47,325
-He loves children so much, and you--
-Sister-in-law.

1200
01:13:47,533 --> 01:13:50,283
They'll have children soon.
They've only been married for six years.

1201
01:13:50,366 --> 01:13:52,991
-Exactly.
-He had to leave this house…

1202
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:55,075
because she wanted to be an actress.

1203
01:13:55,158 --> 01:13:58,325
Look what happened to the most
loved son of this family.

1204
01:13:59,366 --> 01:14:01,491
Forget it.

1205
01:14:01,616 --> 01:14:05,325
Seema, I'd suggest you move
into the room upstairs.

1206
01:14:05,616 --> 01:14:06,658
It's for the best.

1207
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:18,241
How is she going to manage alone?

1208
01:14:46,575 --> 01:14:48,241
What now?

1209
01:14:49,325 --> 01:14:50,908
I want to go back to Mumbai.

1210
01:14:53,033 --> 01:14:54,283
I looked for the tickets…

1211
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:59,116
but all the flights are booked
because of the New Year's Eve.

1212
01:15:00,825 --> 01:15:02,116
There's a flight on 2nd January.

1213
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:06,283
If we stay here until then,
we'll be here for the 13th day ritual.

1214
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:08,616
I feel suffocated here, Nishant.

1215
01:15:14,116 --> 01:15:14,991
Want some?

1216
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:16,908
No.

1217
01:15:20,658 --> 01:15:23,950
Seema… the situation
is quite tense right now.

1218
01:15:24,075 --> 01:15:25,575
Manage for a few more days, please.

1219
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:29,866
If you want,
you can sleep in the room upstairs.

1220
01:15:31,325 --> 01:15:34,366
You don't need to come down.
I'll make them understand.

1221
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,575
Will they understand?

1222
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:39,825
Nishant, don't you think
we've tried enough to fit in?

1223
01:15:40,491 --> 01:15:41,366
But they're just--

1224
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,325
They ask us for money when they need
it, and humiliate us otherwise.

1225
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:47,366
-How is that okay?
-What choice do we have?

1226
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,825
There's been a death in the family.
This is not the time to argue.

1227
01:15:50,908 --> 01:15:53,908
I'm not asking you to argue with them.
Just tell them to accept the truth.

1228
01:15:53,991 --> 01:15:56,741
Which truth, Seema?
Who accepts the truth?

1229
01:15:58,533 --> 01:15:59,908
You talk about others.

1230
01:16:00,366 --> 01:16:02,741
Do you have the guts
to accept your own truth?

1231
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:06,241
What truth are you talking about?

1232
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:09,950
-You're also blaming me just like them!
-Drop it, Seema.

1233
01:16:10,783 --> 01:16:14,200
Pack your things.
I'll find you a hotel tomorrow.

1234
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:17,158
Nishant, wait a minute. Just hear me out.

1235
01:16:48,283 --> 01:16:50,158
Auntie?

1236
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,075
Auntie.

1237
01:16:56,908 --> 01:16:57,783
Hey!

1238
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:01,116
Why are you crying?

1239
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:04,200
It's nothing, Rahul. Don't talk to me.
I'm a bad person.

1240
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:07,533
-Why are you talking like this-- Wait!
-I'm going.

1241
01:17:07,616 --> 01:17:09,741
-Where are you going?
-Mumbai.

1242
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,783
Mumbai? Wait a minute, Auntie!

1243
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:16,325
-No one likes me here.
-I do. Anyway, let me open it for you.

1244
01:17:20,866 --> 01:17:21,866
There.

1245
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,408
So, you like me.

1246
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:33,575
Yes… I like you.
You're my aunt, after all--

1247
01:17:33,658 --> 01:17:38,616
Not in that way.
You like me as in you "like me."

1248
01:17:38,908 --> 01:17:39,783
What?

1249
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:44,283
-No?
-No. Why are you saying this?

1250
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,283
Another lie. You're also lying.

1251
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:52,783
If you like me, then say it!
Whom are you scared of?

1252
01:17:52,866 --> 01:17:55,533
-I'll talk to them.
-Auntie! Please, wait!

1253
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,325
-Let go.
-Yes.

1254
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:07,908
Sit down.

1255
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:12,116
The thing is…

1256
01:18:14,241 --> 01:18:17,950
all your uncles and aunts…

1257
01:18:18,033 --> 01:18:20,866
keep lying to each other.

1258
01:18:22,408 --> 01:18:24,658
They don't like each other.

1259
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,075
Your grandma doesn't like them either.

1260
01:18:27,533 --> 01:18:28,866
She dislikes me the most.

1261
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:31,491
Never mind.

1262
01:18:35,741 --> 01:18:40,158
But they're our blood relatives,
so we must respect them. Right?

1263
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:46,533
I was an outsider, who was expected
to please everyone in the family.

1264
01:18:47,075 --> 01:18:50,533
I couldn't do that,
so they labeled me as a "bad" person.

1265
01:18:58,741 --> 01:19:01,533
-Am I boring you?
-No.

1266
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:04,950
No, why would you bore me!

1267
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:10,825
Okay… you better go.

1268
01:19:12,491 --> 01:19:14,158
-It's very late.
-Yeah.

1269
01:19:15,158 --> 01:19:18,658
-Let me take this.
-Go, Rahul. You must sleep.

1270
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:21,616
-Yes. You should also sleep.
-Yes.

1271
01:19:23,283 --> 01:19:26,950
-Okay, good night.
-Good night, Auntie.

1272
01:19:29,033 --> 01:19:30,908
-I'll lie down.
-Sure.

1273
01:19:35,866 --> 01:19:38,075
Don't tell anyone about this.

1274
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:40,408
-No, I won't.
-Good.

1275
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:48,783
Who is it?

1276
01:20:59,908 --> 01:21:02,741
Oh, no! Today's the 31st.
No one remembered.

1277
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:05,033
-What?
-It's the New Year's Eve.

1278
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,075
As if we were celebrating it.

1279
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:10,741
I'm not talking about that. We forgot
that it was Mom's birthday yesterday.

1280
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:13,616
-Oh, yes!
-Oh, yes! I completely forgot!

1281
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,116
You started your chitchat again!
You're always talking!

1282
01:21:17,408 --> 01:21:21,491
Sister Rani, we were just wondering…
how old is Mom?

1283
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:23,033
Must be about 60 or 62.

1284
01:21:24,116 --> 01:21:26,408
-Her hair's still black. How is that?
-What?

1285
01:21:27,075 --> 01:21:29,283
So, Dad was younger than Mom!

1286
01:21:29,366 --> 01:21:30,575
Are you crazy?

1287
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,491
If Dad was 60 years old,
then how could Mom be 62 years old?

1288
01:21:33,575 --> 01:21:36,325
Who told you that?
There was a gap of 12 years between them.

1289
01:21:36,408 --> 01:21:37,908
Then, how old is Mom?

1290
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,991
I was born when she was 16 or 17.

1291
01:21:41,658 --> 01:21:43,325
You're 54 now.

1292
01:21:44,658 --> 01:21:46,116
I'm only 53.

1293
01:21:46,241 --> 01:21:50,200
-You're still very young, then!
-She's so insolent.

1294
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:10,450
-What is it? Tell me!
-What happened to you, brother-in-law?

1295
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:18,200
I didn't like the tea.

1296
01:22:18,283 --> 01:22:20,116
Oh, no. Here. Sister, have tea.

1297
01:22:23,241 --> 01:22:24,200
Shall we leave?

1298
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:28,741
-How long are you going to sit here?
-How could I forget that she's my aunt?

1299
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,575
How am I supposed to face her now?

1300
01:22:31,658 --> 01:22:35,491
Forget about it. I was the only one who
saw you. I doubt, she'll tell anyone.

1301
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:38,616
She has a bad character, I'm telling you.
I always knew it.

1302
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:41,950
She is good at heart.

1303
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,658
She's not like the other aunts.

1304
01:22:45,283 --> 01:22:47,366
-Do you mean my mother?
-That's not what I meant.

1305
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:50,325
I mean, she's not the person
you think she is.

1306
01:22:52,616 --> 01:22:54,866
Seema is very pure.

1307
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,866
Did you smoke hash this morning?

1308
01:22:59,366 --> 01:23:01,741
She's our aunt.
Don't think about falling for her.

1309
01:23:02,991 --> 01:23:06,658
Sometimes, I feel like hugging her
and showering her with love.

1310
01:23:06,741 --> 01:23:09,200
-Are you crazy--
-Whom do you want to hug?

1311
01:23:12,991 --> 01:23:13,866
This one.

1312
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:18,575
What's going on?

1313
01:23:19,075 --> 01:23:20,866
Brother Samay, let's go home.

1314
01:23:21,325 --> 01:23:23,200
Let's leave the two lovebirds alone.

1315
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:24,283
Let's go!

1316
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:25,741
-Take your hands off me!
-You're looking beautiful.

1317
01:23:25,825 --> 01:23:28,658
-All right, calm down.
-Hey, why do you misunderstand me?

1318
01:23:28,741 --> 01:23:32,033
The tea is ready. You can have it.
Hope it doesn't get cold.

1319
01:23:32,116 --> 01:23:33,325
You are funny!

1320
01:23:33,741 --> 01:23:37,158
Seema, come! Will you have some tea?

1321
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:40,783
-Sure, I'll make it.
-The tea is ready. Here you go.

1322
01:23:41,241 --> 01:23:44,658
Check if there's enough sugar.
We have added very little sugar in it.

1323
01:23:45,283 --> 01:23:48,991
Sister-in-law, can you please pass me
the biscuits? Auntie is feeling dizzy.

1324
01:23:49,075 --> 01:23:50,783
-What happened?
-Relax. Sit down.

1325
01:23:50,866 --> 01:23:53,200
-Be careful!
-Have a seat.

1326
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:55,450
-Have some water.
-Yes. Give it to me.

1327
01:23:55,533 --> 01:23:57,533
You'll feel better in no time.

1328
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,033
And what about--

1329
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:01,491
Seema, you woke up late today.

1330
01:24:02,075 --> 01:24:03,991
Yes, I had a headache.

1331
01:24:04,075 --> 01:24:05,658
Take care of yourself.

1332
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:09,783
It's so cold and your room
is on the terrace.

1333
01:24:09,866 --> 01:24:12,991
-Yes.
-Nishant slept downstairs with Mom.

1334
01:24:13,075 --> 01:24:15,658
-Oh, really?
-Check if the stove is vacant.

1335
01:24:15,783 --> 01:24:18,450
Make some ginger tea.

1336
01:24:18,533 --> 01:24:19,700
-Yes.
-Sure.

1337
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:23,825
-I'll make it.
-Do you know how to make tea?

1338
01:24:24,116 --> 01:24:27,033
Auntie, Seema cooks really well.

1339
01:24:27,116 --> 01:24:30,491
Really? How would I know?
I've never tasted her food.

1340
01:24:30,825 --> 01:24:33,741
My husband's been unwell
since he got up today.

1341
01:24:33,825 --> 01:24:35,366
-What's wrong?
-The usual.

1342
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:38,658
-Oh, you mean cold?
-Yeah, it's freezing outside.

1343
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:39,575
Right.

1344
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,991
Listen, add some black pepper to the tea.

1345
01:24:43,075 --> 01:24:47,075
-All right.
-And some cinnamon, as well.

1346
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:50,450
Also, add a few tulsi leaves
and ginger powder.

1347
01:24:50,533 --> 01:24:55,408
-Should we also fry it with cumin?
-You're so cheeky.

1348
01:24:55,491 --> 01:24:57,616
Auntie, you carry on. I'll get the tea.

1349
01:24:58,116 --> 01:24:59,200
All right.

1350
01:24:59,283 --> 01:25:02,908
-Will you manage, or should I help?
-Be careful.

1351
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:06,783
Are you staying, Seema?

1352
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:08,825
Yes.

1353
01:25:10,033 --> 01:25:13,325
Good. Otherwise,
things would have gotten worse.

1354
01:25:15,075 --> 01:25:16,533
I hope, you're not mad at me.

1355
01:25:17,908 --> 01:25:18,950
No, sister-in-law.

1356
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:22,408
She's moody.

1357
01:25:26,616 --> 01:25:29,575
-Give me the newspaper.
-Yes, even I want to read it.

1358
01:25:30,575 --> 01:25:34,075
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

1359
01:25:36,616 --> 01:25:39,658
-There are always people around--
-Someone's here.

1360
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,658
There's no one here.

1361
01:25:45,325 --> 01:25:46,616
Happy New Year, sister-in-law.

1362
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,283
Come… sit down.

1363
01:26:01,325 --> 01:26:03,825
You're wearing Dad's jacket, right?

1364
01:26:04,741 --> 01:26:07,075
-Mom gave it to me.
-Yeah, right!

1365
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:11,075
Everyone's already started
cleaning out stuff. So shameless.

1366
01:26:42,116 --> 01:26:45,325
Hey, what are you doing?

1367
01:26:46,241 --> 01:26:48,616
-Hey, wait!
-I'm leaving. Bye.

1368
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,575
What's with these tantrums?
Give me a kiss!

1369
01:26:52,866 --> 01:26:54,325
-What happened?
-Nothing.

1370
01:26:57,658 --> 01:26:59,866
Go away. Go!

1371
01:27:00,283 --> 01:27:01,283
I'll see you tomorrow.

1372
01:27:06,783 --> 01:27:07,825
Auntie!

1373
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,991
Why aren't you sleeping?

1374
01:27:16,783 --> 01:27:19,200
Everyone's asleep, so I thought
you must be sleeping as well.

1375
01:27:24,825 --> 01:27:27,283
It's so cold out here.

1376
01:27:35,241 --> 01:27:38,283
They'll be dividing this house very soon.

1377
01:27:38,825 --> 01:27:39,783
You should sell it.

1378
01:27:40,658 --> 01:27:41,991
No one has offered to help you.

1379
01:27:42,408 --> 01:27:46,991
No. Actually,
Nishant had asked me to stay with him.

1380
01:27:47,908 --> 01:27:49,616
So, why don't you go with him?

1381
01:27:50,366 --> 01:27:51,866
How can I go with him, brother?

1382
01:27:52,866 --> 01:27:54,991
Seema's there with him.

1383
01:27:55,283 --> 01:27:57,241
Seema and sister-in-law never got along.

1384
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,616
Then, take turns.
Stay wherever you feel happy.

1385
01:28:01,741 --> 01:28:04,325
Your other daughters-in-law are nice.

1386
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,200
They're just show-offs, brother.

1387
01:28:08,991 --> 01:28:10,741
They're nice, but only from a distance.

1388
01:28:11,283 --> 01:28:17,241
You're right. Now, look at us.
Who bothers to come and see us?

1389
01:28:17,575 --> 01:28:20,075
They just call me
and say, "I love you, Mom!"

1390
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:21,908
Don't go on about yourself!

1391
01:28:24,825 --> 01:28:26,908
Tell me. What will you do now?

1392
01:28:29,325 --> 01:28:30,200
I don't know.

1393
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:35,908
I never imagined I'd be so alone.

1394
01:28:37,616 --> 01:28:40,491
It hasn't even been
13 days since he died…

1395
01:28:41,866 --> 01:28:43,658
and they're already squabbling.

1396
01:28:46,825 --> 01:28:48,491
Sometimes, it feels as though…

1397
01:28:50,866 --> 01:28:56,033
they're celebrating a marriage
or a happy occasion.

1398
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:01,450
Just because you're offering flowers or…

1399
01:29:01,991 --> 01:29:06,533
lighting a lamp in front of his
picture, doesn't mean you're grieving.

1400
01:29:08,533 --> 01:29:12,158
I'm not saying that they
should cry for 13 days…

1401
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:17,616
but at least, they should
not forget why they're here.

1402
01:29:20,491 --> 01:29:22,241
They shouldn't forget whom they've lost.

1403
01:29:22,366 --> 01:29:26,575
I know what they've been doing.

1404
01:29:27,408 --> 01:29:29,283
They're constantly talking
about the things…

1405
01:29:29,533 --> 01:29:31,700
they've done for you and their father.

1406
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:34,366
Have they no shame?

1407
01:29:34,575 --> 01:29:38,866
Did you ever make a list of
the things you've done for them?

1408
01:29:40,866 --> 01:29:46,033
All his desires were crushed under
the burden of our responsibilities.

1409
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:51,450
But he never complained to anyone.

1410
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:56,075
He kept himself happy
by playing the piano.

1411
01:29:56,783 --> 01:29:57,741
He'd say…

1412
01:29:59,408 --> 01:30:03,033
"I could make these musical
instruments sound melodic,

1413
01:30:03,533 --> 01:30:09,116
but I couldn't bring harmony
in the lives of my children."

1414
01:30:11,741 --> 01:30:15,408
I never really understood
what he meant then.

1415
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:19,533
I'm sorry I couldn't help you, Laali.

1416
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:23,741
They're just ungrateful.

1417
01:30:25,241 --> 01:30:26,866
It's not their fault.

1418
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:32,741
I guess, our parenting was wrong.

1419
01:30:35,075 --> 01:30:39,033
We never taught them…
to be grateful for anything.

1420
01:30:40,533 --> 01:30:43,700
We always take our near
and dear ones for granted.

1421
01:30:44,116 --> 01:30:46,325
We never thank them…

1422
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:50,200
or apologize to them.

1423
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:55,491
We think it's their duty
to do things for us.

1424
01:30:56,325 --> 01:30:59,241
We forget that they are just helping us.

1425
01:31:06,533 --> 01:31:08,158
Would you please sign that?

1426
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:10,116
You're having an abortion… why?

1427
01:31:10,533 --> 01:31:12,075
Because I want to.

1428
01:31:18,325 --> 01:31:21,116
We must thank them…

1429
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:25,075
before it's too late.

1430
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,783
<i>How did your hand</i>

1431
01:31:31,325 --> 01:31:34,491
<i>Slip out of my hand?</i>

1432
01:31:34,575 --> 01:31:35,616
Thank you.

1433
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:40,575
<i>You were never so unfeeling</i>

1434
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:44,533
<i>Toward us</i>

1435
01:32:07,158 --> 01:32:11,616
<i>I have always yearned to pause</i>

1436
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:15,616
<i>The time in my hands</i>

1437
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:21,700
<i>Time that just slipped away</i>

1438
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:26,950
<i>Never to be shackled</i>

1439
01:32:27,033 --> 01:32:30,741
<i>Take me in your arms today</i>

1440
01:32:31,325 --> 01:32:35,908
<i>So that I fall asleep</i>

1441
01:32:37,283 --> 01:32:39,533
<i>Without you by my side</i>

1442
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:44,283
<i>My sleep has evaded me for many nights</i>

1443
01:32:52,116 --> 01:32:53,075
Uncle!

1444
01:32:54,825 --> 01:32:57,950
I hope you'll come out today! Are you
planning to catch the train from in there?

1445
01:32:58,033 --> 01:33:00,408
Check once if he's got
down at the last station.

1446
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,991
Just check. Oh, he's come out.

1447
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:07,700
You're a pain in the neck! Should I
just flush myself down the toilet?

1448
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:10,450
-Help me wash my hands.
-There's such a long queue.

1449
01:33:10,533 --> 01:33:12,825
-No one lets him take a dump in peace.
-Here's the towel!

1450
01:33:12,908 --> 01:33:14,783
-What are you doing--
-Take the towel.

1451
01:33:15,075 --> 01:33:16,741
-What about the bucket?
-Oh, right.

1452
01:33:16,825 --> 01:33:18,158
-Here it is.
-Hey…

1453
01:33:18,241 --> 01:33:19,408
-take it from him.
-Move aside!

1454
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:20,825
-The water's hot.
-Step aside!

1455
01:33:20,908 --> 01:33:22,908
-Come on, take it.
-Move out of the way!

1456
01:33:23,283 --> 01:33:25,450
-Take the towel.
-Here, take it.

1457
01:33:26,116 --> 01:33:27,575
Take a shower out here now.

1458
01:33:28,325 --> 01:33:31,825
I've ironed your kurta.
Put it on after taking a shower.

1459
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:34,200
Listen…

1460
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,158
thank you.

1461
01:33:49,116 --> 01:33:51,575
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking a selfie.

1462
01:33:52,116 --> 01:33:53,200
Stupid!

1463
01:33:53,825 --> 01:33:55,908
Tell him it's not done!

1464
01:33:56,616 --> 01:33:58,033
What-- No!

1465
01:33:58,241 --> 01:33:59,533
Don't do that!

1466
01:34:00,075 --> 01:34:00,991
Don't!

1467
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:08,950
What are you doing here? Come on.

1468
01:34:09,033 --> 01:34:11,366
-Don't you understand why you're here?
-Let's take a photo.

1469
01:34:12,658 --> 01:34:14,325
-We also want to join!
-Yes!

1470
01:34:17,075 --> 01:34:19,825
Auntie, can you move a little bit?
Yes, thank you.

1471
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:21,033
Rahul.

1472
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:24,908
Go!

1473
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:34,575
Hey, can you please pass the sabzi?

1474
01:34:35,616 --> 01:34:36,908
We want some more.

1475
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:51,491
Hey, have some more.

1476
01:34:51,575 --> 01:34:54,325
Yes, sure. Wait.

1477
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:03,325
-You're looking nice.
-Thank you.

1478
01:35:36,783 --> 01:35:41,908
<i>The people we thought of as our own</i>

1479
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,283
No more puris are left.

1480
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:49,908
-Did the kids have their breakfast?
-Give them something.

1481
01:35:51,741 --> 01:35:57,741
<i>To imagine we had to explain to them</i>

1482
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:03,241
<i>The meaning of rituals</i>

1483
01:36:09,866 --> 01:36:13,491
<i>The roads, the alleys, and every corner</i>

1484
01:36:13,741 --> 01:36:17,366
<i>Of the house were left behind</i>

1485
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:23,158
<i>Who could say that I once lived here?</i>

1486
01:36:25,075 --> 01:36:28,158
<i>The garland of breathes is now undone</i>

1487
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:31,866
<i>How to weave it together again?</i>

1488
01:36:32,283 --> 01:36:35,575
<i>No one listens to the old songs</i>

1489
01:36:36,033 --> 01:36:39,033
<i>We once sang</i>

1490
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:49,116
-Are the rituals done? Is anything left?
-All done.

1491
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,450
-Can we get up?
-Sure!

1492
01:36:50,533 --> 01:36:52,158
-Let's get up then.
-Let's have some food.

1493
01:36:52,241 --> 01:36:53,491
-Where's Uncle?
-Hey, watch out!

1494
01:36:53,575 --> 01:36:56,908
-Oh, no! Be careful!
-Brother!

1495
01:36:56,991 --> 01:37:00,241
-This means, Dad has left the house.
-What happened?

1496
01:37:00,741 --> 01:37:04,325
How could he just leave?
He hadn't even eaten yet.

1497
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:07,908
The soul does not care for food.
It's free from all the things.

1498
01:37:07,991 --> 01:37:12,783
-So, does the soul go away hungry?
-This ritual is for his salvation.

1499
01:37:13,116 --> 01:37:18,075
Laali, now,
it's our duty to release his soul.

1500
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:22,491
So that when the soul is
freed, it can find peace.

1501
01:37:22,575 --> 01:37:23,783
-Right, Panditji?
-Yes.

1502
01:37:24,075 --> 01:37:26,866
After a year, you'll have to repeat
the same ritual.

1503
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:28,741
-You'll have to come back.
-Everyone?

1504
01:37:28,825 --> 01:37:31,033
-Yes, everyone.
-But why everybody?

1505
01:37:31,533 --> 01:37:34,283
What if someone can't come back?

1506
01:37:34,825 --> 01:37:36,741
Then, let's complete
that ritual today itself.

1507
01:37:38,825 --> 01:37:43,325
-That ritual can only happen after a year.
-Okay, let's complete it today.

1508
01:37:43,783 --> 01:37:46,616
-Sister--
-I want to set him free…

1509
01:37:47,741 --> 01:37:49,200
as soon as possible.

1510
01:37:49,283 --> 01:37:51,241
-But Mom--
-Brother, listen.

1511
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:52,325
Come on.

1512
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:53,991
-Sit down.
-She's right.

1513
01:37:54,075 --> 01:37:54,950
Okay, then. Sit.

1514
01:37:55,033 --> 01:37:57,533
-What are you doing, sister-in-law?
-Please, sit.

1515
01:38:47,991 --> 01:38:49,116
Careful.

1516
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:54,450
Look after your mother, son.
She's all alone now.

1517
01:38:54,533 --> 01:38:55,950
I'm still here, Laali!

1518
01:38:57,241 --> 01:38:58,450
Let's go.

1519
01:38:59,741 --> 01:39:01,075
Brother, drop them off carefully.

1520
01:39:02,408 --> 01:39:03,575
Thank God, they're gone.

1521
01:39:04,033 --> 01:39:05,908
Let's go. They're gone.

1522
01:39:06,075 --> 01:39:06,991
Let's go, Mom.

1523
01:39:07,075 --> 01:39:08,533
-That's mine.
-This is yours.

1524
01:39:08,616 --> 01:39:09,450
Hi!

1525
01:39:10,033 --> 01:39:11,450
You're glowing in pink.

1526
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:14,575
-Are you leaving, Rahul?
-No, I just got here.

1527
01:39:23,741 --> 01:39:24,575
Take this.

1528
01:39:27,366 --> 01:39:28,575
We look nice together, right?

1529
01:39:30,825 --> 01:39:33,450
-When will you come back again?
-I don't know.

1530
01:39:35,991 --> 01:39:38,325
Hey, stop it! Are you crazy?

1531
01:39:38,408 --> 01:39:39,700
-I love you, Rahul.
-What?

1532
01:39:40,158 --> 01:39:41,283
I'm in love with you.

1533
01:39:41,825 --> 01:39:42,783
It's true love.

1534
01:39:44,075 --> 01:39:46,825
Before you go, just tell me
what you think of me!

1535
01:39:46,908 --> 01:39:48,575
-Bittu!
-I'll wait for you.

1536
01:39:48,658 --> 01:39:49,908
-What are you doing?
-Just tell me, Rahul--

1537
01:39:49,991 --> 01:39:50,991
What should I say?

1538
01:39:52,783 --> 01:39:54,783
Have you lost it? Grow up.

1539
01:39:55,658 --> 01:39:58,158
We're friends with benefits.
Do you understand what it means?

1540
01:39:58,783 --> 01:40:01,908
I'll see you if I come back,
but not every time.

1541
01:40:03,158 --> 01:40:04,116
What?

1542
01:40:05,283 --> 01:40:07,908
Why are you staring at me
as if I've betrayed you?

1543
01:40:07,991 --> 01:40:10,741
Two people just celebrated
the New Year's Eve together. End of story.

1544
01:40:11,241 --> 01:40:12,991
What's the big deal?

1545
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,116
Leave. Don't chew my brains.
I don't have time for this.

1546
01:40:23,533 --> 01:40:25,366
This time, the <i>laddoos</i> weren't that good.

1547
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:29,200
Last year, they were just delicious.

1548
01:40:29,283 --> 01:40:30,991
I'd got them made under my supervision.

1549
01:40:31,075 --> 01:40:34,366
-Let me see.
-How can I eat them, then?

1550
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:36,075
-What?
-They're too hard.

1551
01:40:36,908 --> 01:40:37,908
No problem.

1552
01:40:38,408 --> 01:40:41,116
When it'd be your turn,
we'll get the better ones.

1553
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,991
-Oh, no.
-So, are you waiting for me to die?

1554
01:40:44,075 --> 01:40:45,158
I didn't mean that.

1555
01:40:45,491 --> 01:40:46,908
-But--
-Look at yourself!

1556
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,866
You may die before me.

1557
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,575
-Is your packing done, sister-in-law?
-Sulekha, listen.

1558
01:40:56,408 --> 01:40:59,283
I'm glad you're here.
What should we do about Mother-in-law?

1559
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:00,991
Our husbands haven't decided anything.

1560
01:41:01,116 --> 01:41:04,533
We'll have to decide.
These brothers are totally useless.

1561
01:41:04,616 --> 01:41:06,033
-True.
-Isn't it their responsibility?

1562
01:41:06,116 --> 01:41:07,325
Must we do everything?

1563
01:41:08,116 --> 01:41:09,283
We're the daughters-in-law.

1564
01:41:09,450 --> 01:41:11,491
People will say that we
abandoned our mother-in-law.

1565
01:41:11,575 --> 01:41:14,825
Now, we'll have to look after
our husbands and their mother.

1566
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:19,408
Listen, let's work it out over the phone.

1567
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:22,491
-All right.
-Whoever has the time,

1568
01:41:22,825 --> 01:41:25,658
-can spend a few days here.
-I don't even have a minute to spare.

1569
01:41:25,825 --> 01:41:28,825
I can't have my children miss
school, and sit here.

1570
01:41:29,116 --> 01:41:32,408
As though I have time.
You know my husband's condition, right?

1571
01:41:32,491 --> 01:41:34,991
So, do you think I have
all the time in the world?

1572
01:41:35,116 --> 01:41:37,533
What about the fourth daughter-in-law?

1573
01:41:43,283 --> 01:41:46,408
Listen, what should we
do about Mom's loan?

1574
01:41:49,575 --> 01:41:52,700
Our parents never gave
us any responsibility.

1575
01:41:53,783 --> 01:41:56,325
That's why, even we never
shouldered any responsibility.

1576
01:41:57,366 --> 01:41:59,616
For the first time,
we're getting to behave like adults.

1577
01:42:00,491 --> 01:42:01,825
We shouldn't miss this chance.

1578
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:05,783
We will… always be there for her.

1579
01:42:06,741 --> 01:42:07,700
Let's go.

1580
01:42:08,283 --> 01:42:10,033
-Let's go.
-Give that to me.

1581
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,908
Pay your respects to your aunt.

1582
01:42:56,241 --> 01:42:57,366
-No, it's fine.
-Hurry up.

1583
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:59,408
Take him with you.

1584
01:42:59,533 --> 01:43:02,783
He keeps talking about you.

1585
01:43:03,283 --> 01:43:04,408
Do you want to go with her?

1586
01:43:04,658 --> 01:43:07,658
Seema, call us whenever you
get time from the shoot.

1587
01:43:07,741 --> 01:43:09,700
-Yes.
-Don't feel bad.

1588
01:43:10,033 --> 01:43:11,700
-Don't lose heart.
-We'll meet again soon.

1589
01:43:12,325 --> 01:43:14,283
-Goodbye.
-Yes, I have told him.

1590
01:43:14,366 --> 01:43:16,616
-Come for my birthday next year.
-Sure.

1591
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:19,075
-Visit us in Agra.
-Keep in touch.

1592
01:43:19,158 --> 01:43:21,366
-We'll show you around.
-You packed everything, right?

1593
01:43:22,033 --> 01:43:23,908
-Yes.
-Now, I'll directly come to your wedding.

1594
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:27,408
You should also visit
us during the holidays.

1595
01:43:35,741 --> 01:43:37,033
Sorry, Mom.

1596
01:43:38,366 --> 01:43:39,200
Bye, Auntie.

1597
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:40,991
Bye, Paakhi.

1598
01:43:41,075 --> 01:43:43,450
-Hey, Paakhi!
-I'm coming!

1599
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:47,991
Take care of yourself.

1600
01:43:50,825 --> 01:43:53,283
Take care of yourself.

1601
01:43:53,366 --> 01:43:54,575
Yes, I will.

1602
01:44:12,491 --> 01:44:13,741
Keep singing.

1603
01:44:15,075 --> 01:44:16,158
I'll give you a call.

1604
01:44:27,491 --> 01:44:30,533
I'll come back soon, Mom.

1605
01:44:32,616 --> 01:44:33,658
I'm always there for you.

1606
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:44,283
Come on. I'll show you out.

1607
01:44:55,033 --> 01:44:56,033
Mom…

1608
01:45:00,783 --> 01:45:01,616
Mom…

1609
01:45:03,033 --> 01:45:08,033
our shop has been mortgaged,
so we can't sell it.

1610
01:45:09,616 --> 01:45:13,991
So, I was wondering-- In fact,
we all were wondering…

1611
01:45:15,241 --> 01:45:17,866
what if we sell the rest of the house…

1612
01:45:18,491 --> 01:45:21,825
except for this part?

1613
01:45:22,241 --> 01:45:24,116
We'd be able to repay
the loan from that money.

1614
01:45:24,241 --> 01:45:25,158
Yes, Mom.

1615
01:45:27,533 --> 01:45:30,158
You'll get lonely in this big house.

1616
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:34,200
-Yes.
-How will you manage all the cleaning?

1617
01:45:35,158 --> 01:45:36,950
We won't be here to help.

1618
01:45:37,575 --> 01:45:38,533
-Right?
-Mom…

1619
01:45:39,241 --> 01:45:41,700
we can't arrange such
a huge amount in a short time.

1620
01:45:41,908 --> 01:45:44,658
We can't make this decision.

1621
01:45:44,741 --> 01:45:45,825
You must say something.

1622
01:45:46,325 --> 01:45:48,408
Mom, say something.
Why are you so quiet?

1623
01:45:51,408 --> 01:45:52,908
What are you thinking about?

1624
01:46:02,658 --> 01:46:06,741
You all should leave now.
It's time for your train.

1625
01:46:08,533 --> 01:46:11,616
You don't want to miss the train.

1626
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:49,908
How is she going to manage
everything on her own?

1627
01:46:50,283 --> 01:46:51,991
She's hiding something from us.

1628
01:46:55,825 --> 01:46:57,533
She won't say what she feels.

1629
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:06,950
-What's this? Show it to me!
-Hey--

1630
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:13,575
The loan papers?
Are you going to pay it?

1631
01:47:14,033 --> 01:47:16,366
Stop blabbering!
Just have your tea!

1632
01:47:21,033 --> 01:47:23,866
Mom must have hidden
some money somewhere.

1633
01:47:24,033 --> 01:47:26,075
That's impossible!

1634
01:47:26,991 --> 01:47:30,700
Do you think she has a job? Nonsense!

1635
01:47:39,825 --> 01:47:41,366
It's all a sham.

1636
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:44,991
Mom is very cunning.

1637
01:47:45,908 --> 01:47:47,700
She's kept her children in the dark.

1638
01:48:52,241 --> 01:48:53,116
Did you fix it?

1639
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:55,366
Yes.
One chord was faulty.

1640
01:48:55,450 --> 01:48:57,950
I fixed it and it's playing well.

1641
01:48:58,283 --> 01:49:00,450
Great! Play something for me.

1642
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:23,533
<i>Our life is like the seven musical notes.</i>

1643
01:49:23,991 --> 01:49:27,408
<i>You have to find the note</i>
<i>that suits you fine.</i>

1644
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:33,366
<i>When you find the note,</i>
<i>your life will become easy.</i>

1645
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,283
<i>This life belongs to you.</i>

1646
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:39,158
<i>So, the musical notes</i>
<i>should belong to you as well.</i>

1647
01:49:39,241 --> 01:49:45,241
RAMPRASAD MUSIC SCHOOL

1648
01:49:48,366 --> 01:49:49,908
Welcome!

1649
01:49:51,241 --> 01:49:53,783
Namaste. Please come in.

1650
01:49:54,908 --> 01:49:57,533
Why didn't you come yesterday?

1651
01:49:57,950 --> 01:49:59,991
Namaste, my child.

1652
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:04,033
Namaste.
