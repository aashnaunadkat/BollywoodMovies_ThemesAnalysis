1
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,078
Sabarwal International school..

2
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:26,039
..is one of the top five schools in India.

3
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,169
 Straight  and one..

4
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,670
Our teachers are not just from India..

5
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,680
..they come from abroad too.

6
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,139
 Very good  now put your hands down.

7
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,640
The motto of our school is..

8
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,719
Education is the Birth Right of every Child.

9
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,659
Very nice. - But..

10
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,590
I cannot help you with your nephew's admission.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,500
I mean...

12
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,229
Look at this.

13
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,730
You can forget about fifth grade.

14
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,569
According to our school standards..

15
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,659
..we cannot admit him in second grade either.

16
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,629
Look at him.

17
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,730
He's only interested in playing video-games.

18
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,079
 Sorry  sir.

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,580
Whenever Bittoo's nervous  he starts playing.

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,580
Since his parents demise  he's got only two supports.

21
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,639
 Rimpi  and that PSP.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,198
He's completely addicted to it.

23
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,699
 But  don't worry.

24
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,629
I'll personally do his homework and projects.

25
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,629
Like all other parents.

26
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,550
Just.. admit him in your school  Mr. Principal.

27
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,149
What's this?

28
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,650
Gift for sister-in-law. - What nonsense!

29
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,629
Get out! Get out!

30
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,569
 Not out  look in. In!

31
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,680
There's more.

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,620
Rascal!

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,168
You dare try to do a Sting operation on me.

34
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,669
You think you're some kind of a hero.

35
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,550
Who sent you?

36
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,138
 You will be the star tomorrow  sir.

37
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,639
When you'll have more media people running after you..

38
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,680
..than Aamir Khan.

39
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:21,629
'Kabootar'! - 'Kabootar?'

40
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,509
 Hey  what are you doing?

41
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,629
 Good morning  sir.

42
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,680
Good morning.

43
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,699
Why do you follow me? Why do you pull me back?

44
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:03,669
 Why are you after me?

45
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,650
Come face me  and I'll slap you hard.

46
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,599
 Everyone say with me.

47
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,569
 Play on.

48
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:23,509
 Play on.

49
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,579
 You'll face the music.

50
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:34,529
 Yes  you'll face the music.

51
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,620
 You eat my bread and snap at me!

52
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,610
 You look like a dog.

53
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,550
If you come back  I'll slap you again.

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,540
 Everyone say with me.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,500
 Play on.

56
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,579
Girlfriend tells her boyfriend to quickly remove her top.

57
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,208
Boyfriend says okay.

58
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,709
Play on. - And then girlfriend tells her boyfriend..

59
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:04,589
..to now remove her skirt.

60
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,639
Boyfriend says okay.

61
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,540
Girlfriend scolds and says... Dare you wear my clothes again!

62
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,730
It's either this guy or that.. just play on.

63
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,600
 Play on.

64
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,670
 Here or there  just play on.

65
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,680
 Play on.

66
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,670
It's either this guy or that.. just play on.

67
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:44,629
 Here or there  just play on.

68
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,560
 Play on.

69
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,709
 Play on.

70
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,550
Sukhi!

71
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,550
Did you get admission? When are the exams?

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,028
Sooner than you expect

73
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,529
The principal's right behind us with the exam sheets.

74
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,509
Let him come.

75
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:43,629
Balloo. Gun!

76
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,629
Is he a principal or a shooter?

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,500
Balloo!

78
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,699
 Sukhi  are you having fun?

79
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,720
It's just like when we used to..

80
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,529
..flee from Agarwal's house with the noodles.

81
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,550
 But  Agarwal never fired at us.

82
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,589
This way. - Stop.

83
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,610
 Stop  you rascals.

84
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,109
 There you go  mom.

85
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,610
Our local cable's ready to broadcast breaking news.

86
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:26,629
Shall I press the button? - No  'Kabootar'.

87
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,519
This game's all about 'timing'.

88
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,720
This goes on air only when I get the message from Ballu.

89
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,730
Wait.

90
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,699
Rascals! Come out!

91
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,560
You think you can make breaking news out of me.

92
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,569
Rascals!

93
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,550
You don't know who I am.

94
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:53,649
 Mr. Sethi  we're your true admirers.

95
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
 And  we want to make you famous.

96
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,730
If you don't believe us  call your wife. - Wife?

97
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,198
What did you two did with my wife?

98
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,699
Lover-boy. When you don't do anything with your wife..

99
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,589
..what do you expect us to do? Dance?

100
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:11,509
Stop firing. It'll just make things worse.

101
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,509
Call your wife.

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Hello. - Hello. Pammi.

103
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,699
How are you? - What's wrong with me?

104
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,569
Nothing. I was worried.

105
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,550
Okay  I'll call you later. - Okay.

106
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,138
Listen. - Yeah.

107
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,639
I love you. - I love you too  baby.

108
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,600
Lover-boy. Ask your wife to switch on the local news.

109
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,639
Pammi  switch on the television. - Okay.

110
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,710
Just a minute.

111
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:45,679
Sabarwal International school..

112
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,690
 Oh  my God!

113
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,048
You never told me..

114
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,229
..that your interview's coming on television.

115
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,730
 Oh  so exciting.

116
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:55,679
 I've to tell my friends  okay.

117
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,570
 Okay  bye.

118
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,700
Rascals. What's this nonsense?

119
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,509
Come out. I'm throwing down my gun.

120
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,730
 Fine  we'll stop this nonsense.

121
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,590
You can ask your wife to check again.

122
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,649
What do you want? - 500 million.

123
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,580
500 million? - In cash.

124
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:20,219
I don't have that kind of money.

125
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,720
You rob the parents in the name of education.

126
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,610
And now you say you don't have the money.

127
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,590
You guys must have made around 700-800 million..

128
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,649
..with admissions and donations alone.

129
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,590
We're only asking for 500.

130
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,639
Please believe me.

131
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,559
I might have around 150 to 200 million  in cash.

132
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,700
300 million  final. - Look..

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
That's a small price for Sabarwal's reputation.

134
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,559
Yeah.

135
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,509
And  the admissions are still going on now.

136
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,549
This scandal can cost you dearly.

137
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,580
What's the guarantee that you won't make copies?

138
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,610
Mister. You think we're selling you water-pump..

139
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,509
..that you're demanding guarantee.

140
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,138
We aren't putting a bullet through your head.

141
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,639
Consider that a guarantee.

142
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,679
Fine. When and where do you want the money delivered?

143
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,659
Come to Hyder Kholi  Chandni Chowk by 1 pm.

144
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,730
And wait for our call.

145
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,580
You think Rs.2000 is a measly amount.

146
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,519
Tell me.

147
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,620
 Forgive me  sir.

148
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,529
It was a mistake.

149
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,639
Your existence is the biggest mistake.

150
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,700
Fool!

151
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,659
 Take a look  Mr. Sethi.

152
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,710
He's apologising after losing Rs.2000.

153
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,730
You know what it's worth when you try to earn it.

154
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,559
 So  what brought you here?

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,500
I..

156
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,710
 Actually  I...

157
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,600
You didn't visit the school for a long time.

158
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,509
So  I just wanted to make sure everything's fine.

159
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,720
What's wrong with me?

160
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,580
The Yoga teacher in school..

161
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,690
..has made me fit.

162
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,549
Everything's okay.

163
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,148
Hello.

164
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,649
 Not a rupee less  understand?

165
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:38,649
Who are you  madam.. - I'll do the talking.

166
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,629
And  listen carefully  I am not going to repeat it. - Yes.

167
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:45,649
Keep the bag of money at Bashir Miya's shop..

168
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,590
..which is exactly opposite Nandu bread-maker.

169
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,229
Yes.

170
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,730
Then go to Nandu's shop and say..

171
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,610
..Three radish stuffed bread  with extra butter.

172
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,199
That's your codeword.

173
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,700
 Say that  and he'll give you the PSP.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,189
What's my account?

175
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,690
The total's 460.

176
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,539
Give me another box and a betel leaf.

177
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,620
The total then comes to 500.

178
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:23,629
Yes  mister. What do you want? - Nothing.

179
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,509
Nandu Bread-maker.. - That's the one. Right there.

180
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,639
That one? - Yes.

181
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,128
 Come one  come all.

182
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,629
'Aalu Paratha  Gobi Paratha  Paneer Paratha'.

183
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,119
 Pour me some more gravy  son.

184
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,620
Aunt  do you want to bathe in the gravy?

185
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,600
There you go  aunt. - That's not your problem  son.

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,500
 'Aalu Paratha  Gobi Paratha.

187
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,509
Yes  mister 'Aalu Paratha  Gobi Paratha  Paneer Paratha'.

188
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,730
Three Muli Paratha's with extra butter. - Okay.

189
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,710
Three Muli Paratha's...and extra butter..

190
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,590
Smeared or poured?

191
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:03,629
Smeared. - Okay.

192
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,690
Smeared with extra butter. - Some more gravy  son.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
 Here you go  aunt.

194
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,580
What's this?

195
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,629
Rascal. What's this nonsense? - Quiet.

196
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,580
What's going on? - Quiet.

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,089
Where's my tape?

198
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,590
Let go my collar.

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,500
I was told whoever orders three Muli Parathas..

200
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,690
..smeared with extra butter  give this calculator to him.

201
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,580
That's what I did.

202
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,610
Oh no!

203
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,559
Move back! Move back! Move back!

204
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,659
Move back!

205
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,519
What's your name? - Bashir Miya.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,209
 What's wrong  sir?

207
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,710
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

208
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,639
Did you find the bag? -We've found the bag.

209
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,720
Where?

210
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:16,639
Next to Bashir Miya Paan Centre at Chandni Chowk.

211
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:19,509
 Yes  it's a black bag.

212
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,229
Move back!

213
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,730
Move back!

214
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,639
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

215
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,720
Bomb!

216
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,209
Who are you?

217
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,710
I am the principal.

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
School? - Yes.

219
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:47,649
 Principal sir  please move back.

220
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,710
Let the police do their job.

221
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,109
Move back.

222
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,610
Move back.

223
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:54,549
Two more bags found in the middle of the road.

224
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:58,679
Please repeat the location.

225
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,580
Mid chowki  we've found two more bags here.

226
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,539
It's a serial bombing matter.

227
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,590
 We'll be right there  over.

228
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,620
Harbat.

229
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:12,639
Move.

230
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,509
Bomb! Bomb!

231
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,509
Take the car at the back.

232
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,600
Hello. - Hello.

233
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,559
Are you Jasveer Baweja.

234
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,730
Yes.

235
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,690
Where's your son Sukhwinder.

236
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,539
He's gone out for some important work.

237
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
 Please  come in.

238
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,639
What are you two doing here?

239
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:00,639
Did you diffuse the bomb on the road?

240
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,629
The bomb's exploding in here.

241
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,509
This suit's hot like an oven.

242
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,639
My leg's completely cooked.

243
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,089
Take a look.

244
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,199
Food's the only thing on your mind.

245
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,700
Take a look yourself.

246
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,509
You should've seen the look on the principal's face.

247
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,679
He couldn't understand..

248
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,539
..why the police's taking his 300 million?

249
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,690
Whose plan was it after all?

250
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,620
Ballu the great  with my aunt's blessings.

251
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,730
By the way  did you take a course in acting as well?

252
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,710
You see  when your life's on the line..

253
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,549
..the worst actor can give the best performance.

254
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:33,639
 Don't worry  brother. I am there.

255
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,509
The 'Biryani's' ready. Please taste it.

256
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,730
The one for tonight? - Yes.

257
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:42,549
The rice is not completely cooked. - Okay.

258
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,600
Let it steam for another 15 minutes. - Okay.

259
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,690
 Leave that here  I'll finish it.

260
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,710
Let it be  you don't need to take the trouble.

261
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,660
Look.. - My son  Sukhi.

262
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,509
And they are his friends. - Hello.

263
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,519
Hello  sir. - Hello. Hello.

264
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,618
I'm getting a call.

265
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,519
Jeet.

266
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,680
Here's your treasure.

267
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,189
 You see  aunt.

268
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,690
He installs the connections..

269
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,640
..and makes us hold the set-top boxes.

270
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
Hold it.

271
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,640
Goodbye. - Bye.

272
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,549
See you again. - Okay.

273
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,670
Sukhi.

274
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,549
 Mintu  what a twist.

275
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,179
We're in a big mess.

276
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,680
70 people have filed a case against us.

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,500
If we don't return them their money..

278
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:01,199
..our house will be auctioned.

279
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,700
They can't auction our house.

280
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,539
Who do they think they are?

281
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,599
Sukhi.

282
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,579
It was an order for a grand wedding.

283
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,710
The food was so delicious  I brought it for you.

284
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,650
The mince-meat's really tasty. - Yeah.

285
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,690
Kailash kept stirring it for two hours.

286
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,630
You know. It's still a little uncooked.

287
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,519
Should've let it cook some more.

288
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,619
Nonsense.

289
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,710
Thank God! We were successful in our plan.

290
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,710
And it was a big victory too.

291
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,720
We got the money  and video evidence against Sethi.

292
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,519
After all  who made the film? - The film's yet to be made  son.

293
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,670
We just managed to sum-up 300 million.

294
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:51,589
We need 1.2billion more.

295
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,650
Think.

296
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,680
I know you don't like this.

297
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,509
If you were alive  you wouldn't have let us do this.

298
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,670
Remember  you would always catch me cheating in rummy.

299
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,660
 But  Mr. Baweja..

300
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,549
..some mess can be cleaned only by crooked ways.

301
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,559
We don't have another choice.

302
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,519
Ravinder Baweja's an asset for our bank.

303
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,199
He's our pride.

304
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,700
Mr. Baweja.

305
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,650
On this occasion  I would like to say that..

306
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,579
..I want this bank to be for the middle-class  and common man.

307
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,660
Where they can keep their money safe..

308
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:56,589
..and earn good profit.

309
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,189
Thank you.

310
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,690
 Sir  according to this scheme..

311
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,500
..how can we give 15% for three months of cash deposit?

312
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,640
Don't worry about the interest.

313
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,670
Try to lock as many people you can in this scheme.

314
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,700
What if someone wants to pay by cheque?

315
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,549
No  Saira. This scheme's for the lower-income group.

316
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,680
 And  most of their income's in cash.

317
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,690
This is why Mr. Sabharwal's opened..

318
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,660
..a separate title account for this scheme.

319
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,730
And  you two are the signing authorities.

320
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,730
 Here you go  Mr. Baweja.

321
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,680
I had a small flat in Dwarka.

322
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,650
I sold that and brought 900 000 for you

323
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,630
These are some of my savings.

324
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,179
Take these.

325
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,680
The scheme certificate.

326
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,500
Saira Madam. What can be a bigger assurance..

327
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,670
..than Mr. Baweja himself.

328
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
The scheme's doing really well.

329
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,539
Mr. Gupta  these are the investor's money.

330
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,519
Tally them and keep them safely.

331
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,640
So  what were you up to till 4 am in the morning?

332
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,519
Nothing. I've nothing to do.

333
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,650
Is this the time to come home?

334
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,559
If only you had approved my loan..

335
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,680
..I would've come home on time.

336
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,700
You're drunk. Go on.

337
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:21,609
Get some sleep. - No  I want to say this.

338
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,640
If he had approved my loan..

339
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,640
..I wouldn't be installing cable-connections in Dariyaganj

340
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,690
I'll hang you by those cables wires. Useless.

341
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,710
Drunkard.

342
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,559
I will. I will drink every day.

343
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:37,609
I don't want to do this job anymore.

344
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,229
You can do anything you like.

345
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,730
But don't ever come back to this house drunk again.

346
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,720
Fine  I'm leaving Delhi. - Stop  son.

347
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,559
Don't go. Sukhi.

348
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,660
You had to say it.

349
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,088
Sukhi. My son.

350
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,219
He'll be back soon.

351
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,720
She's pampered him too much.

352
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,219
 Hello  uncle. Hello  aunty

353
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,720
Diwali's here.

354
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,720
Come. - Happy Diwali.

355
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,559
Don't eat all of them.

356
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,670
Happy Diwali. - Happy Diwali.

357
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,519
Happy Diwali. - Happy Diwali.

358
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,700
 Come  sit

359
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:12,509
Aunt.

360
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,509
Happy Diwali. - Bless you.

361
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,700
She's made my Diwali sad.

362
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,690
She's been upset since Sukhi left.

363
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,559
Sukhi will be back soon.

364
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:27,589
He's not left home for the first time.

365
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,579
Where is our money?

366
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:33,189
Will we get our money or not?

367
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,690
We want to know.

368
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,559
Mr. Baweja  what should I do with this?

369
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,690
It's been five months.

370
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,619
When will we get our money?

371
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,670
Mr. Chadda  please calm down. - Why?

372
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
The bank will return everyone's money  with interest.

373
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,579
 Interest? No  no  no..

374
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,660
We don't want any interest.

375
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,670
We just want our money back.

376
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,730
Has the cat got your tongue?

377
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,599
Just tell us..

378
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:59,519
Sir  you're handing us over to the police.

379
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,549
We deposited 1.5 billion of the investors..

380
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,589
..in the title account  on your orders.

381
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
What money? What title account?

382
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:12,519
 What are you saying  Mr. Baweja?

383
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,700
Mr. Gupta  why don't you say something?

384
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,529
You know I gave you the money.

385
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,159
 Yes  Mr. Gupta. Go on.

386
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,660
 Sir  he didn't give me any money.

387
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,710
Sir  they are lying. - What?

388
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,710
 Baweja. Fraud  cheating with the bank.

389
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,730
I've been serving this bank for 30 years

390
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,569
You know my honesty.. - Shut up!

391
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,720
You can say whatever you want at the police station.

392
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:37,149
Take them away.

393
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,650
Come on. - Listen to us  sir.. - Come on.

394
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,068
What's going on here?

395
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,199
Why are you making a racket?

396
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,700
 Mr. Sabharwal. Hello  sir

397
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,660
My employees Baweja and Saira swindled your money.

398
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:14,209
You won't get them back..

399
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,710
..by making a racket in the bank.

400
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,559
I want you to go and lodge an FIR against them at the station.

401
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,710
But  still.. - Our money..

402
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,569
Quiet!

403
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:30,589
Come on. - Leave.

404
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,589
Who's going to return our money now? - Yeah  Who?

405
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:48,549
The bank has washed their hands from this matter. - Right.

406
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,619
Where's our money?

407
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,179
They can't just disappear.

408
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,680
My name's Chadda. - We will not let take our money. Look. There he is.

409
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,690
Here comes the thief's son.

410
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,500
Okay. - Let him come.

411
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,509
We'll make him pay. - Right.

412
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,098
We gave him our hard earned money.

413
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:07,599
They can't take our money.

414
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:50,569
 I am sure  Mr. Baweja.

415
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,660
You didn't do anything wrong.

416
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,509
 Mom  I want to say something.

417
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,539
I never said this before..

418
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,619
..how much I loved him.

419
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,579
I know he always yelled at me.

420
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,680
But  I always respected his principals.

421
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,690
 By God  we'll clear his reputation.

422
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,670
Cheers for marriage  health and wealth. - Cheers.

423
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,670
I've made the best arrangements for the wedding.

424
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,509
 Mr. Sabharwal  I feel that's expected.

425
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,700
 You see  today's television star..

426
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,720
..and the future film star  that's my son Aman. Right?

427
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,690
Mr. Sabharwal  I feel like you've found a gem.

428
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,500
Do you see the ethics I imbibed in him?

429
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,529
I asked him to get married  and he said yes instantly.

430
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,670
You see  he has 2000 friend requests pending on Facebook.

431
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,650
 And  from girls.

432
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,078
 But you see  brother.

433
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,579
I will fulfill my promise.

434
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,710
 Reception  in Taj Mumbai.

435
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,229
Honeymoon in Europe.

436
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,730
 And  1.5 billion  they're all ready.

437
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:28,068
You've just one daughter.

438
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:29,569
 You're bound to do that much  right?

439
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,710
Yes.

440
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,569
You're right.

441
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:35,509
Once daughter's married..

442
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:38,599
..then  I've a few more responsibilities.

443
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,599
Once they're dealt with..

444
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,509
..life will be really peaceful.

445
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,700
 Sabharwal  don't worry.

446
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
We still have a long way to go?

447
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:52,519
Which way? Shall I get the car?

448
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,509
Why don't you explain him?

449
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,650
Try to understand what I am saying.

450
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,539
You didn't hear what I said.

451
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:02,599
 You see  I am trying to say..

452
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,640
..once my sister becomes the cabinet minister..

453
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,579
 ..then  just watch.

454
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:09,529
I'll get that bank case dismissed completely.

455
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,710
As far as your files are concerned.

456
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,660
I'll get them cleared in a snap.

457
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,720
You.. made me so happy by saying that.

458
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,169
Really..

459
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,670
 On that note  he'll tell you a joke.

460
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,690
Go on.

461
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,619
 Sir  which one?

462
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,700
Just tell him a joke. - Yes.

463
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,660
Message..

464
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:43,569
Boyfriend to his girlfriend.

465
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,599
 Sweety  come home in the evening

466
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,088
There'll be no one.

467
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:50,589
Sweety comes home in the evening.

468
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,670
 And  there's no one there.

469
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,710
There's..

470
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,569
That's the joke.

471
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,509
What a joke..

472
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,710
 Yes  it's true. That's nothing.

473
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,660
There's more. - Stop it  Aman.

474
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,660
 I am going to die laughing

475
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,680
You will really get along with papa. - I see.

476
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,680
You've got a wicked sense of humour.

477
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:24,599
But  you had this innocent look on the reality show.

478
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,720
 You see  baby.

479
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,539
That was Aman's strategies to win the reality show.

480
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,640
It's called 'Mind Games' sweetheart.

481
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,579
'Mind Games.' -'Mind Games!'

482
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,730
You smoke? - Of course.

483
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,680
 When Aman's happy  he smokes.

484
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,660
But  aren't you doing an anti-smoking campaign on television?

485
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,700
 Image  baby. Image.

486
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,229
One has to do it.

487
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,730
 And anyway  I charge for it.

488
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,730
You charge for it? - Of course. I'm a celebrity.

489
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,509
 Wow! Now  that is hot.

490
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,609
Stop leaching. - I am not leaching..

491
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,730
I'm just admiring the beauty.

492
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,690
What's the time? - Are you getting late?

493
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,589
Yeah! It's time to hit the gym.

494
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,529
Come.

495
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,189
What? - The cable rent.

496
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,690
You charge full rent  but always show half movie.

497
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:42,569
The rest of it is wasted in ads.

498
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,509
So  we don't make them at home. - Yes  you do.

499
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,690
Do you see her attitude? - Always complaining.

500
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,650
Here you go. Get lost.

501
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,730
No need to come next month.

502
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,720
They think they own us along with the connection.

503
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,690
Sukhi. - Hello.

504
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,730
Hello.

505
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:06,519
You don't show English movies at night.

506
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,660
Okay  we'll show one at the weekend. - Okay.

507
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,579
You've really grown up.

508
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,630
These beggars don't have a connection. - Hold on  Sukhi.

509
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,599
They're watching C.I.D. mom's favourite serial.

510
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,730
What the.. They're stealing our connection.

511
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:46,509
Wait.

512
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,720
Who are you? - No need to get personal.

513
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,539
 Sukhi  from Jasbeer Cable.

514
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,630
We don't want a connection.

515
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,710
Don't you see that doorbell?

516
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:57,609
Why were you pounding on the door? - This is just the beginning.

517
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,189
What's going on inside?

518
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,690
'Chikni Chameli's dancing.'

519
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,199
Do you have a problem?

520
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,700
I know you're watching CID.

521
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:07,569
I can have you jailed for illegal cable connection.

522
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,139
Where are you going?

523
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,640
Stop. Stop.

524
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:12,108
You don't own it.

525
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:13,209
 Let's settle it over something

526
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,710
Corruption's in your blood.

527
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,720
We're decent people. - We're no thieves either.

528
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,710
So  you are watching CID. - Yes.

529
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,630
 Preeto  move aside. Let me watch CID.

530
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,700
Who are you? - Sukhi  from Jasbeer Cable.

531
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:31,599
Preeto. Move aside. The criminal's about to be caught.

532
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,199
You can watch the repeat.

533
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,700
They've a lot of those.

534
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,539
First  how long have you been watching cable for free?

535
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:39,549
Since they tried to kill Daya for the first time. You calculate. Move aside.

536
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:44,589
Attack on Daya.. - Five months.

537
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,500
Sorry. We've been watching since five months.

538
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,549
Since five months. Rs. 1000 for the connection..

539
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:52,549
 ..and 250 a month  adds up to Rs.2250.

540
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,700
Are you going to pay here or at the police station?

541
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,630
How about a concession?

542
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,509
We can't give you any concession.

543
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,549
You will have to pay 2250.

544
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,720
We make an honest living.

545
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,500
We still have honest people amongst us.

546
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,500
I've only 150.

547
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,690
I'll adjust the 100 in next month's rent.

548
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,609
Sukhi from Jasbeer Cable.

549
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:29,509
Tomorrow if you close shop  we'll lose 100 rupees.

550
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:32,569
 Fine  I'll have it sent tomorrow.

551
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,670
We won't close down business for 100 rupees.

552
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,589
Send the rest tomorrow.

553
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:47,509
What else do you want?

554
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,670
Let's go. What are you looking at?

555
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:03,088
You haven't finished your second drink yet.

556
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:04,139
I already finished my third.

557
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,640
What's wrong with you? - Make me another.

558
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,640
By the way..

559
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,510
You know that milk factory job?

560
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,570
I've stationed Kabootar there.

561
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,218
Its done?

562
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,719
You're the best 'Make-shifter' in this world.

563
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,679
No! I've told you many times.

564
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,670
Come after 10 am. - It's Sukhwinder Baweja.

565
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,559
Cable-guy.

566
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:01,519
Did you stand out here all night? - No.

567
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,570
I couldn't sleep all night.

568
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,579
I had to refund your 100 rupees.

569
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,710
And  my mom says loan is the biggest burden.

570
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,690
Fine. Then  lighten your burden. - Yeah.

571
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,530
Sorry. I've only 50.

572
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,590
I think I lost the remaining 50.

573
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,539
Can I pay you later?

574
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,639
Yes. Of course.

575
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,610
 But  don't stay up all night.

576
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,699
What now? - I found 20 more.

577
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,590
It was in the secret pocket.

578
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:09,719
What's this about? - I've got 10 more.

579
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:13,519
 My beloved.

580
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,650
This time.. I've 500.

581
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,670
Can we go watch the morning show in Saket?

582
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,710
 It's the age of love.

583
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,699
 Girl  you're soft like butter.

584
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,670
 I'm bound to lose my heart.

585
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,530
 It's the age of love.

586
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,209
 Girl  you're soft like butter.

587
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,710
 I'm bound to lose my heart.

588
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,659
 My eyes clicked when I saw you.

589
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,610
 Your image's posted on my heart.

590
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:20,719
My heart's.. filled with only your images.

591
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,590
 Dance with me.

592
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,579
 Give me a dose of your love.

593
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,650
 It's the age of love.

594
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,619
 Girl  you're soft like butter.

595
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,599
 I'm bound to lose my heart.

596
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,539
 My eyes clicked when I saw you.

597
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,500
 Your image's posted on my heart.

598
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,699
 Your eyes spell black magic.

599
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:11,639
 You've made me lose control.

600
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,510
 Your eyes spell black magic.

601
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,710
 You've made me lose control.

602
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,659
Come  let me take you around the world.

603
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,610
Say yes  and we'll fly away on a holiday.

604
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,699
 It's the age of love.

605
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,659
 Girl  you're soft like butter.

606
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:56,639
 I'm bound to lose my heart.

607
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,579
 My eyes clicked when I saw you.

608
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,539
 Your image's posted on my heart.

609
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,550
One  two  three  four.. five.. six.. seven.. eight and again

610
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,500
Oye! Hey Shilpi! - One  two

00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,590

Nice to meet you. - Heard a lot about you.

616
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,650
Do you teach here? - No. I am a student.

617
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,690
 Sir  the lights have been installed.

618
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,229
The stage is set.

619
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,730
 And  I've put up five huge generators.

620
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,570
 And  the dancer.

621
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,530
Let's talk to her right now. - One.. Two.. Three..

622
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,659
Hello. - Hello  Ms. Shilpi.

Sudhir Bagga. - Yes  Mr. Bagga.

625
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,659
You are coming  to teach dancing in the wedding.

626
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,570
I am so sorry  but it's not possible for me at all.

627
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,630
But you said you will. - Right  I did say I will.

628
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,530
But  a personal problem has come up. - What?

629
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:12,559
But  don't worry I'll send you a replacement. - I see

630
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,109
She's a very good dancer..

631
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,610
..and  her charges are lower than mine. - Thank you.

632
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,630
Bye. Bye.

633
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:25,599
It's done. - You did one good thing  Bagga.

00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,630
 And one  two  three  four..

00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,590
Hi  dad. - My doll.

638
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:38,679
Hi  dad. - What's going on?

639
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,590
 Meet Manpreet  our new choreographer.

640
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,218
 By the way  she's fantastic.

641
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:43,719
Hello. - Hi  sir.

642
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,650

 After all  it's my daughter's wedding.

 Definitely  sir.

646
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:54,639
Sir  if you don't mind  can I say something? - Of course.

647
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,659
You don't look like Gudiya's dad.

648
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,550
You've maintained yourself so well. - You don't know  dad.

649
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,570
He does power Yoga every morning one hour. - Wow.

650
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:05,069
Thank you.

651
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,570
You two can continue  we'll leave. - See you  sir.

652
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,699
Bye. - Bye.

653
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,679
Okay  again? - Yes.

00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,530
So and yes..

655
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:19,639
Bye. - Bye.

656
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,500
Preet.

657
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,098
Thanks.

658
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:32,599
Without you.. - No need to say anything.

659
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,639
But  without you.. - I did this for myself  not you.

660
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,599
What? - You won't get it.

661
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,710
But really  if you ever have a problem..

662
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,029
Why are you getting sentimental?

663
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,530
Do one thing  get my granny free life-time cable TV.

664
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,619
Then we're even.

665
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,198
What?

666
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,699
Do you want to get me emotional and get a kiss?

667
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,530
Get lost? - Bye.

668
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:17,559
Thanks.

669
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,579
That Manpreet's a great girl. - Why?

670
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,710
We couldn't come up with an idea..

671
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:24,679
..and she managed to get in Sabharwal's home.

672
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,579
Wait and watch  she'll set things right.

673
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:31,209
Then ask her to do everything.

674
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,710
What are you doing here?

675
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,699
Why? Jealous?

676
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,178
Brother-in-law?

677
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:42,679
Tell us which is real? - Rascals.

678
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,730
You're drinking beer  and offering me milk.

679
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,530
 Brother-in-law  just taste it. Please.

680
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,730
 Oh  God! That's too much.

681
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,510
 Brother-in-law  drink the milk.

682
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,699
Bagga. Is it 'Naag Panchami' today?

683
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,579
Sir. Milk is good for health.

684
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,699
I see. Good for health?

685
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:11,699
So  get healthy. Come on. - No  no  no.

686
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,579
Milk doesn't suit me. - Bagga.

687
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,719
Pick up the glass.

688
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,710
Try the first one.

689
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,699
This is real.

690
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,650
No! - No!

691
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,570
This is real.

692
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,670
No! - No!

693
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,630
The third one.

694
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,510
This is real. - Absolutely not.

695
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,710
 Brother-in-law  all of them are fake.

696
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,530
Amazing. The cream's absolutely real.

697
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,610
We've stumbled upon an amazing chemical.

698
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,530
Not just cream  but milk  butter  butter-milk  all A-1.

699
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:14,559
We'll produce the milk  and you can take the cream.

700
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,049
 And  the real one.

701
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,550
Now  we don't have to mix fake products with the real ones.

702
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,510
We'll now supply them completely fake products.

703
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,530
We need to make the first delivery in three days.

704
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,550
 After that  we'll be rolling in money.

705
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,610
 And  swimming in cash.

706
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,510
And you know  they keep their money in the fridge.

707
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:43,209
What the..

708
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,710
If they keep the money in the fridge..

709
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,690
..where do they keep the curd?

710
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,710
 So  let's make things sour for them..

711
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:50,699
..with cream on top.

712
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,610
 Play on.

713
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,619
 Play on.

714
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,550
Sir  come. Madam. - Who is it?

715
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,699
Ministry of Health and Food..

716
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,670
Our madam.

717
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,500
We'll have to seal your dairy. - You..

718
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,559
We've information that you make adulterated milk here.

719
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:30,699
And  you're drinking liquor here as well.

720
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,129
No shame at all.

721
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,630
Get up. Get up. - Get up.

722
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,189
Where's the processing unit? - Come on.

723
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,690
Inspector Chaudhary  start the proceedings..

724
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,650
..and seize their licence. - Ok  madam.

725
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:41,178
Madam  listen.. - Let's go..

726
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:42,679
Madam.. - Open the door.

727
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,630
Where are you going? - So  Milkmaid  show me your licence.

728
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,690
Adulteration with milk. - Milk  without a cow.

729
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,109
Rascal.

730
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,610
Take a picture.

731
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:00,719
Sir. Can I make a call?

732
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,699
I see.

733
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,500
'Praise be to Lord Shiva!'

734
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:24,679
'Praise be to Lord Shiva!'

735
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,699
Yes. - Brother-in-law  there's a problem.

736
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:28,719
There's been a raid at the dairy.

737
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,610
 Don't know  some lady officer.

738
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,550
Handle the situation at any cost.

739
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,550
If Gudiya's father-in-law finds out  he'll cancel the wedding.

740
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,690
Get the cash out of the dairy.

741
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:43,639
 And  send that dairy to Jenny.

742
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:46,189
Tell her that I sent her a gift.

743
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,690
But  ask her not to open it as long as I don't get there.

744
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,510
Tell her I'll be at her place tonight.

745
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,500
Are you Mr. Sabharwal's brother-in-law?

746
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,610
First cousin from mother's side.

747
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,599
Oh Mother.. - What happened?

748
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,539
Don't complain about this to your brother-in-law. - I see.

749
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:10,719
It won't affect this madam.

750
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:12,659
 But  your brother will have me sacked.

751
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,510
Look  please help me out. - Ok.

752
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,630
 You can take this out  if you want.

753
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:21,539
If you want to save your job..

754
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,610
..then  you'll have to save us from your madam.

755
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,530
My madam? - Yes.

756
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:31,679
Shall I get rid of her?

757
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,710
I'll have to bribe everyone. - Just do it.

758
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:40,539
Just get our fridge out of this factory. - I see.

759
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,149
Let's see.

760
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,650
You'll get the job done?

761
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:50,559
Sure?

762
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,539
 Yes  sir. Jai Hind!

763
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:54,679
Inspector Chaudhary  the commissioner's..

764
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:56,719
..summoned me urgently.

765
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,510
Continue your proceedings here  and keep reporting to me.

766
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,670
 Raman  what's wrong with you?

767
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,510
Is this filled with milk or alcohol?

768
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,690
 Here you go  sir. That's one million.

769
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,530
Listen to me carefully. - Yes.

770
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,659
Only one of you will go with the fridge. - Fine.

771
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,619
 And  he'll go along with you.

772
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,699
No problem.

773
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:25,699
Jenny must feel it's a gift  that's what brother-in-law said.

774
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:29,570
When will we send a gift to Jenny?

775
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:31,679
Only when brother-in-law let's go.

776
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,500
Here. Give this to Jenny on my behalf. - Fine.

777
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,229
Let's go.

778
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:38,730
Come on.

779
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,510
Careful. Don't worry. - Okay.

780
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,519
All the best.

781
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,610
Jenny. - Raman?

782
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,699
 Hi  Jenny.

783
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,570
This is brother-in-law's gift for you.

784
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:11,229
This is from my side.

785
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,730
Oops. Sorry.

786
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:15,189
Thank you.

787
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,690
 Fridge? But  I already have a fridge.

788
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,550
No  no  there's a big surprise. - Surprise?

789
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,510
Brother-in-law will tell you later.

790
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,630
He'll come at night.

791
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:26,539
Please don't open.

792
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:28,639
 Hello  lady. Myself Jogi.

793
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:31,619
How's your day? - Hi. I am okay.

794
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,590
 Shall we go  sir?

795
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:45,659
 Hello  lady. Jogi again.

796
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,730
Remember.

797
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,619
Actually  we gave you the wrong fridge.

798
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,530
So  we've got you the new fridge. Look.

799
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,690
This has more features.

800
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,550
Colour. Wonderful.

801
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:03,619
Hi. - Who are you?

802
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:06,559
I.. am Jogi.

803
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,510
Aren't you Mr. Sabharwal? - Yes.

804
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:11,719
Mr. Sabharwal! You've two factories. I know it.

805
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,599
You've many other factories.

806
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,670
 You have schools  bungalows. Right?

807
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,049
 Hold on  I am getting a call.

808
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,550
I get nervous.

809
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,670
Hello. I'm with Mr. Sabharwal.

810
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,650
I'll be right there. Okay?

811
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,138
Of course. We'll definitely meet.

812
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:32,639
Who was he? - Raman came with the fridge  so he was with him.

813
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:36,559
And  those two guys are exchanging the fridge right now.

814
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,510
I never ordered any replacement.

815
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,579
Who is it? - They're there in the kitchen?

816
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,579
Where?

817
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,550
Who is it?

818
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,519
Hey!

819
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:52,539
Close the door.

820
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:56,169
Hey!

821
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,670
Open the door.

822
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,579
Thank God!

823
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:13,559
Brother-in-law!

824
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,149
Yes.

825
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,650
Rascals. I would've lost 500 million because of you.

826
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,510
I've delivered your fridge  with balloon.

827
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:23,699
Shut up! Balloons!

828
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,610
The raid on the dairy was a fake. - What? Fake?

829
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,619
Find out who they were?

830
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:32,659
No wonder Sood left so soon.

831
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:35,519
What's happening?

832
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:44,519
Yes.

833
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,500
Yes.

834
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,670
But.. the money's safe.

835
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:51,619
 But  what's happening with me?

836
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,550
You're going through a bad phase.

837
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,690
The planets are not in your favour.

838
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:58,559
 Do something  please.

839
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:01,599
Stay quiet until Gudiya's marriage.

840
00:52:03,139 --> 00:52:04,198
The wedding day's auspicious.

841
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:05,699
Arrange for a feast and donation to 101 Brahmins before the marriage.

842
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,550
You'll be rid of all problem's  Sabharwal.

843
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:12,699
Okay.

844
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,650
 Mom  I did tell him that..

845
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,690
..you trust that Manpreet too much.

846
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,579
Mintu was right there. Ask him.

847
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:32,610
 Ballu  shut up.

848
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,138
I wonder how Sabharwal turned up there.

849
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:36,639
Otherwise  we would've finished the job.

850
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,630
What do you mean how?

851
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,610
Whose job was it to keep an eye on him?

852
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,730
She was given just one job.

853
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,049
 But  she couldn't do that either.

854
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,550
Let's forget what happened?

855
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,630
At least we got our hands on 1.5 million.

856
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,530
You can use that to buy stuff for your catering business.

857
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,710
That's what it's good for.

858
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,510
 And him  lover boy.

859
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:58,579
 She'll set things right.

860
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,530
Do you see now?

861
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,570
I say chuck Manpreet out of this plan.

862
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:05,209
Why chuck her out?

863
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,710
Calm down! Calm down!

864
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:09,619
We need to think what next?

865
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,730
What else? I'll round up some boys.

866
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,530
We'll rob the rascal at gunpoint. - No abusing here.

867
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,510
Are you crazy? - Why?

868
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:20,679
Because  we aren't professional dacoits.

869
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,699
Taking our own money is not stealing.

870
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,218
Like this?

871
00:53:24,219 --> 00:53:25,719
 And  what if we're jailed after this.

872
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,189
Who is going to explain him that?

873
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,690
Okay  then you can do whatever you think is right.

874
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:32,699
I am going.

875
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,500
Ballu. Stop  son. - Bye!

876
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,500
Ballu.

877
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,510
Inspector Valli called today.

878
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,500
The investors are after our lives.

879
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,519
If we don't return them our money..

880
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,510
..then we'll all be out on the streets.

881
00:53:48,139 --> 00:53:49,639
Nonsense!

882
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:02,610
Look.

883
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:05,639
Don't worry.

884
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:07,719
Everything will be fine.

885
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,619
I'm only worried about aunt.

886
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:17,710
 Look after her  please.

887
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:22,659
And..

888
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,539
..you too.

889
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,510
Saira.

890
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:40,539
I'll get you out of here soon.

891
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,630
You two only find faults with me.

892
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:57,650
What about Sukhi  who's ruining the entire plan..

893
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,690
..for the sake of love?

894
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,650
No point in fighting amongst ourselves  Ballu.

895
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,610
We'll be on the losing end.

896
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,500
The court has issued orders.

897
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,570
If we don't repay them in two weeks..

898
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,500
..aunt loses everything.

899
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:25,719
We're in a big mess.

900
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:27,710
 Don't worry  mom.

901
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,630
Mintu will show me how to crack the safes.

902
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,670
You don't understand. Ballu has to be with you.

903
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:35,599
He won't take a second to crack Sabharwal's safe.

904
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:40,650
 Yeah  we did have an argument.

905
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,690
Stop fighting. Bow down.

906
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,690
Ballu's calling.

907
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,619
Hello. - Hello  aunt. Balwant speaking.

908
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:28,198
 Hello  son.

909
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:29,699
Pardon me  I walked out in a fit of rage that day.

910
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,579
 But  don't worry.

911
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,029
We will win in the end.

912
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,530
Ballu. I was just talking to Sukhi about you.

913
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:39,679
Look  you two shouldn't argue amongst yourselves.

914
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,570
After all you're brothers.

915
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,650
I just prayed for everyone at the 'Gurdwara'.

916
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:48,719
Why don't you ask the Lord to join our team as well?

917
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,619
All our problems will be cleared.

918
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:56,209
 Right  son.

919
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,710
Listen. - Yes.

920
00:56:58,099 --> 00:56:59,599
Come home in the evening. - Okay  see you.

921
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,650
Bye  son. - Bye.

922
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:03,659
Ballu's agreed. He's coming home in the evening.

923
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:06,719
 Let's go  son.

924
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:32,138
 Okay  everyone.

925
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:33,639
 Five  six  seven  eight start..

926
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,510
 He's hiding.. behind her glares.

927
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,530
 Sometimes peers from above.

928
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:46,599
 Or spies from below.

929
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:48,679
 He's hiding.. behind her glares.

930
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,710
 Sometimes peers from above.

931
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:55,539
 Or spies from below.

932
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,500
 Steals my heart.

933
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,730
 Steals my heart.

934
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,650
 With an arrogant style.

935
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,730
 Your mischievous eyes.

936
00:58:12,219 --> 00:58:13,719
 Your mischievous eyes.

937
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:18,559
Your mischievous eyes. - Papa.

938
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,699
Look at papa.

939
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:23,619
Your mischievous eyes. - Papa  you're looking so funny.

940
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,610
Uncle  try to feel the words and beats of the song.

941
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,198
That's what I'm trying to do.

942
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:30,699
Am I doing it fine? - You're better than Malaika.

943
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,590
I was talking about uncle.

944
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,049
It's very simple.

945
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,169
Give me your hands. Okay.

946
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,670
 Back  back  now come ahead.

947
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,599
Yes. Right. - Papa. This looks like gym class.

948
00:58:43,179 --> 00:58:44,679
Manpreet  can you give papa some simple steps?

949
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:47,699
 You shut up  dear.

950
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:49,619
Manpreet's popular in Delhi. she is fantastic - I know.

951
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,699
Just watch  she'll turn me into Hrithik before the cocktail party.

952
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,730
Hrithik.

953
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,619
Gudiya  I think you're making him conscious.

954
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,510
You just go  I'll help him practise. - Please.

955
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,500
Alright. I'll go. I'm famished anyways.

956
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,138
Thank you. - Let's go.

957
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:06,639
Ma'am  shall we stay here. - No  take them outside.

958
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,550
Help them rehearse. - Yes.

959
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,500
 You know  uncle. You're too stiff.

960
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:14,579
Just loosen up.

961
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,500
Loosen up.

962
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:18,599
You need to practise hard to dance like Hrithik.

963
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,590
I can dance all night if you like?

964
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:24,719
Do you have the stamina  uncle? - Try.

965
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,500
 But  don't call me uncle.

966
00:59:29,059 --> 00:59:30,559
Call me  Mohan. - Okay  Mohan.

967
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:32,719
Shall I play the music? - Yes.

968
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,699
Sir.

969
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,550
The food's served.

970
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:44,630
Gudiya's saying if you could join her..

971
00:59:47,059 --> 00:59:48,559
No?

972
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:50,639
 Manpreet  let's eat.

973
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:52,719
 Carry on  Mohan. I'll join you.

974
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:55,539
Waiting. - Yes.

975
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,670
Don't.. you understand I'm rehearsing.

976
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,519
Bagga. The kebabs.. superb.

977
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:07,530
Superb. - They are world famous.

978
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,510
 Hello  ma'am.

979
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:28,659
Hello.

980
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:30,178
The dress really suits you.

981
01:00:30,179 --> 01:00:31,679
You're looking nice.

982
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:34,559
 Amazing  our tastes are so similar.

983
01:00:37,059 --> 01:00:38,109
 You're having salad  so am I.

984
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,610
I believe in eating light.. - Mohan.

985
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:41,699
I believe you can eat all you want.

986
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,218
But exercise double.

987
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:45,719
That's what Salman says as well.

988
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,559
Oh  Salman says that. - Yes.

989
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,530
Then  we must have soup and starters along with it.

990
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:51,719
Hey.. - Mohan.

991
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:53,599
I don't want to sound rude.

992
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:55,530
But your arrangements are so classy..

993
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,570
 ..but  the food's so middle-class.

994
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,550
 So  the salad.

995
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,590
I think.. you should arrange for something better.

996
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:05,178
I hope you didn't make the same arrangements..

997
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:06,679
..for the marriage and reception.

998
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,690
Bagga. - Sir.

999
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,570
Yes  sir. - With whose permission did you make this arrangement?

1000
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,639
Were the caterers your relatives?

1001
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:19,229
Who did you ask?

1002
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:20,730
Sir  you approved ten items.. after that it was a go ahead.

1003
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,058
I.. - So..

1004
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:27,559
 Don't argue  Bagga.

1005
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,519
Manpreet says the food's rubbish.

1006
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:32,209
Rubbish. - Mohan.

1007
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,710
According to your class and style..

1008
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:36,699
..I think you should try Modern Caterers and Decorators.

1009
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:39,670
Remember the wedding  of the Diwan's? - Yes.

1010
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:41,209
They handled the catering there.

1011
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,710
I was the main choreographer there.

1012
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,590
The food was so tasty  and so expensive  oh God.

1013
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,500
I see. Bagga. Call Modern Caterers.

1014
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:52,639
Sir  what about the commitment you made to them.

1015
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:56,530
Manpreet's saying it. So  it's final Bagga.

1016
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:00,579
Address? - Find it  Bagga..

1017
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:02,719
Dictionary? - Yes  go.

1018
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:07,710
Do you need salt in the salad? - Do I need salt?

1019
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:19,218
 Hold on  I'll find out.

1020
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:20,719
Sir  it's the Agriculture Minister on line.

1021
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,579
Yes.

1022
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,559
 No  no  we're heavily packed.

1023
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,098
Not a chance.

1024
01:02:27,099 --> 01:02:28,599
We can't cancel our prior commitments for the Minister.

1025
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,610
Yes?

1026
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,530
I am Bagga.

1027
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:41,639
On behalf of Mr. Sabharwal's..

1028
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:44,719
His daughter's getting married.

1029
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,619
So  I need to discuss the catering order.

1030
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:51,619
Who's the boss?

1031
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:55,539
 Obviously  me.

1032
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:58,118
Good.

1033
01:02:58,119 --> 01:02:59,619
So  Mr. Sabharwal's a renowned industrialist.

1034
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,530
Her daughter's getting married to that boy..

1035
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,530
 ..serial superstar  Aman Kapoor.

1036
01:03:11,179 --> 01:03:12,679
The boy's family demands..

1037
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:15,639
..they want only Modern Caterers.

1038
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:20,149
 I said  it'll be done.

1039
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,650
 And  here I am.

1040
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:23,650
Was I right?

1041
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,730
What's he saying?

1042
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:29,699
Seems like a genuine client.

1043
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:31,679
And  he's got a strong reference as well.

1044
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:33,730
I think we should do it.

1045
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,109
Thank you very much.

1046
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:37,610
If it wasn't for you  things would've gotten difficult for me.

1047
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:40,579
That's okay. You're a genuine guy.

1048
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:43,519
And  you're paying double. - Right.

1049
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,650
We've to look after you as well.

1050
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:48,209
I had a question.

1051
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:49,710
That small boy looks after your business.

1052
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:52,710
He's our younger brother.

1053
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,619
10 years ago  mom found him crying outside the bungalow.

1054
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,129
She brought him home.

1055
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,630
He's very lucky for the business. - Oh my God.

1056
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,599
You made an orphan your brother.

1057
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,690
He's no orphan  he means more than a brother.

1058
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,500
Sorry for hurting your feelings.

1059
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:14,579
Very few people respect others.

1060
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:28,559
 Play on.

1061
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,710
 Play on.

1062
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,679
Modern Caterers and Decorators.

1063
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:45,158
Quality and Quantity.

1064
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,659
We offer the best. - Since summer of '69.

1065
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,189
Good.

1066
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,690
Bagga. That's called class.

1067
01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:53,599
Five star service right at home. - Yes.

1068
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:56,659
Thanks  Bagga. - My pleasure  sir.

1069
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,500
Tell Manpreet about this. - Yes.

1070
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,550
 Wonderful  teacher..

1071
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,650
You're making Sabharwal dance to your tunes.

1072
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:08,149
 Right  Ballu.

1073
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,650
Yeah. She's a dance teacher after all.

1074
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:12,530
You would know better.

1075
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,610
But  I shouldn't have been on the team  right Sukhi.

1076
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,500
No. You see  Ballu's always short-tempered.

1077
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:21,659
Forgive and forget. - Hey. Don't ruin things for me.

1078
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,590
If Sabharwal gets a whiff  it'll spoil our plan.

1079
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,630
Stay away from each other.

1080
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:31,699
Stay away.

1081
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,550
 He's hiding.. behind her glares.

1082
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:42,590
Sometimes peers from above. Or spies from below.

1083
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,630
 Don't worry  Mr. Bagga.

1084
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,169
Ballu's made arrangements for the dais..

1085
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,670
..decoration and conveyance.

1086
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:51,209
I see. - Yes.

1087
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,710
There's nothing other than that  right?

1088
01:05:53,019 --> 01:05:54,178
I was really worried.

1089
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:55,679
But  with you around I've nothing to worry.

1090
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:57,510
You can forget all your worries. - No..

1091
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,500
Get up. - Oh no.. - No  son..

1092
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,579
Sorry  sir. - It's okay.

1093
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:05,198
Everyone makes mistakes.

1094
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:06,699
 And anyway  the kebabs are cold.

1095
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:10,659
You should always serve hot fresh kebabs to the guest.

1096
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:13,610
I'm sorry  sir. - Get fresh kebabs from the oven.

1097
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,550
 I will just get them. Sorry  sir.

1098
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:19,619
 Wow! That's amazing  brother.

1099
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,500
You treat your staff so nicely.

1100
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,690
Mr. Bagga  the staff is the foundation of our business.

1101
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,690
Not the boss.

1102
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:31,670
And  if we don't respect them  they'll spoil our business. - Great.

1103
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:36,579
And  there's something called humanity.

1104
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:39,639
Great.

1105
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:41,710
 Really  great.

1106
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:43,550
She's hot-headed  and she's having a tiff with me.

1107
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:47,630
 She's insane  and in a bad mood.

1108
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,730
She's hot-headed  and she's having a tiff with me.

1109
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,610
 She's insane  and in a bad mood.

1110
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:01,519
She's hot-headed  and she's having a tiff with me.

1111
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:05,590
She's hot-headed  and she's having a tiff with me.

1112
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,730
 Loves to have an affair.

1113
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,510
 Tries to convince me.

1114
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,579
 Loves to have an affair.

1115
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:15,599
 Tries to convince me.

1116
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,619
 Teases me slowly-slowly.

1117
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:22,699
 Your mischievous eyes.

1118
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,690
 Your mischievous eyes.

1119
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,539
 Your mischievous eyes.

1120
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:34,639
 Your mischievous eyes.

1121
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,500
 Wow  Mohan. What a performance.

1122
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:41,510
I am impressed. - All because of you.

1123
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,550
First of all  your suggestion Modern Caterers..

1124
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,650
..saved my reputation  their food was simply delicious.

1125
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,610
 And  the way you made me dance.

1126
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,500
I mean  the entire party.. - Anything for you.

1127
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:55,539
I think you're getting late.

1128
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:58,590
Bagga. Bagga. - Sir.

1129
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:01,559
Sir. - Drop madam home.

1130
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,530
 Of course. Madam  just two minutes.

1131
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,218
There's chaos at the parking space.

1132
01:08:06,219 --> 01:08:07,719
I'll just deal with that and be right back.

1133
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,719
Are you mad?

1134
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,670
Will you decide what you're going to do?

1135
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:15,719
Who's your boss?

1136
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,209
Who's your boss?

1137
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:18,710
It's my order.

1138
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,550
Say yes. - Yes.

1139
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,139
You will drop her.

1140
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,640
Say yes. - Yes. Yes.

1141
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:26,569
What happened  papa? - Nothing.

1142
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,720
Okay.

1143
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:33,539
 Yes  madam. Please.

1144
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:36,630
He's in a bad mood.

1145
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,500
Bro  what can a poor servant do when the boss yells at him?

1146
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:45,630
 Don't worry  I'll drop her.

1147
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:47,699
I'll drop her. - I.. I..

1148
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,158
Just relax. I'll drop her.

1149
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,659
Come. Come with me. - Thank you.

1150
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,600
Bagga. Bagga. - Yes.

1151
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:57,539
Don't mind but  such small things often happen in a party.

1152
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,099
Come on.

1153
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,600
How about a lovely-lovely.. for a change of mood?

1154
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:11,670
Bagga. Have one more.

1155
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:17,539
Okay.

1156
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:19,659
Sukhi.

1157
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:24,579
You're like my brother.

1158
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:28,569
You know how to give respect.

1159
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,510
And then there's that..

1160
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:37,699
Sabharwal.

1161
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,560
I've been with him since 20 years.

1162
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:47,729
Forget about respect.

1163
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,520
He keeps abusing..

1164
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:55,689
..and humiliating me all day.

1165
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,569
 Relax  bro. You're drunk.

1166
01:10:02,109 --> 01:10:03,609
Sabharwal's the one who's high.

1167
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,510
I said..

1168
01:10:12,109 --> 01:10:13,609
Please admit my daughter in your school.

1169
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:21,729
He says..

1170
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:24,619
Your daughter won't become a doctor or engineer?

1171
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,600
Get her admitted in a public school.

1172
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,500
And be grateful.

1173
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,640
And I was so hurt hearing this..

1174
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,600
I just can't tell you.

1175
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,640
 And  then there's you.

1176
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:01,710
You're showering that orphan with love.

1177
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:07,699
Raising him like family.

1178
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:13,609
God gives everyone a chance.

1179
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:16,689
You too.

1180
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:22,569
Out with it.

1181
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:31,670
This farm house is more like a fortress.

1182
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:34,550
I'm tired  but couldn't find the stash anywhere.

1183
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,219
There's just one place left now.

1184
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,720
His bedroom. - You didn't check his bedroom yet.

1185
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:44,659
He doesn't allow anyone in there.

1186
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,560
What now?

1187
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,600
Tomorrow's 'Mata Ki Chowki' (prayer ceremony).

1188
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:53,659
That's when I'll get the opportunity.

1189
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:56,158
Fine. Careful.

1190
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,659
 Hail the Goddess.

1191
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:59,729
 Glory to the Mother Goddess.

1192
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,500
Wow. It's so amazing.

1193
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,500
See I told you. - And  I told you.

1194
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,228
Don't drink too much.

1195
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:11,729
If brother-in-law finds out we're drunk..

1196
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,510
..he won't spare us.

1197
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:17,659
We can't even walk.

1198
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,510
How can we run?

1199
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,179
I..

1200
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,680
Why did you bring her here? - Brother-in-law!

1201
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,710
She wanted to see Indian culture.

1202
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,579
So we said we'll take you to 'Mata's Chowki'.

1203
01:12:33,029 --> 01:12:34,529
This way  we can do two things at one time.

1204
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,228
 We're the Goddess's super fans.

1205
01:12:49,229 --> 01:12:50,729
The One with the red veil and black eyes.

1206
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:52,670
 We're dear to the Goddess.

1207
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,600
 We'll serve you day and night.

1208
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:00,510
 I love You.

1209
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,590
 I sing your praises.

1210
01:13:05,229 --> 01:13:06,729
O Goddess. - Glory to You.

1211
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,680
 Bless us with Your grace.

1212
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,510
Give us Your blessings. - Glory to You.

1213
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:17,699
 Alleviate our pain.

1214
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:21,590
 O Goddess.

1215
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,680
Bless us with Your grace. - Glory to You.

1216
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,680
Don't let the night pass away. Don't let this bond break.

1217
01:13:30,069 --> 01:13:31,569
 We'll sit all night at your feet.

1218
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,680
 O Goddess.

1219
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,520
 O Goddess.

1220
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,640
 O Goddess.

1221
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,590
 Hurry up  we don't have time.

1222
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,550
Yea. Open it.

1223
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:54,619
 Shower us with wealth.

1224
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,560
 Solve our problems.

1225
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,640
O Goddess. - Glory to You.

1226
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,510
 Come here  take a look.

1227
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,710
Look there.

1228
01:14:11,069 --> 01:14:12,569
 Make this plan perfect.

1229
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,699
 O Goddess. We request you.

1230
01:14:21,079 --> 01:14:22,579
Don't let the night pass away. Don't let this bond break.

1231
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,089
 We'll sit all night at your feet.

1232
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,590
 O Goddess.

1233
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:31,710
 O Goddess.

1234
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:35,539
 O Goddess.

1235
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,179
Come here. Here.

1236
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:39,680
It's empty. - Nothing here.

1237
01:14:42,109 --> 01:14:43,609
Look there. Come on.

1238
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:45,689
How much?

1239
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,680
I said it once..

1240
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:53,579
I'm disconnecting.

1241
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:55,729
Mohan. - You?

1242
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,640
Actually  I had a request. - Yes. Tell.

1243
01:15:05,189 --> 01:15:06,689
Not here. - Let's go in the room.

1244
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,500
 No  let's go in the balcony.

1245
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,600
Come on. - Yes. - Come on.

1246
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:14,659
 You are great.

1247
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:16,659
We sing Your praises  You're truly amazing.

1248
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,510
We come to Your threshold  for Your blessings.

1249
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:23,689
Your grace is true  we're your children.

1250
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,579
Every Saturday  is an auspicious day for us.

1251
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,710
 Everyone sing with me..

1252
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:35,510
Don't let the night pass away. Don't let this bond break.

1253
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:37,129
You sing very well.

1254
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:38,630
 We'll sit all night at your feet.

1255
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,500
Don't let the night pass away. Don't let this bond break.

1256
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,670
Remember my friend Shilpi.

1257
01:15:47,069 --> 01:15:48,569
The one who recommended me.

1258
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,158
Yes.

1259
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,659
We're inaugurating our dance academy day after tomorrow.

1260
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,108
In Kalkaji.

1261
01:15:54,109 --> 01:15:55,609
 And  I want you to be the chief guest.

1262
01:15:58,199 --> 01:15:59,699
Me  chief guest? - Please. Don't say no.

1263
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:06,659
If you say so.. - Thank you.

1264
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:10,539
 By the way  Manpreet..

1265
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:12,619
..this dress really suits you. - Oh.

1266
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,219
Sir!

1267
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,720
Come quickly.

1268
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,600
Raman and Pawan are troubling the lady singer.

1269
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,219
Come quickly.

1270
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,720
If you don't come Goddess will get angry.

1271
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,590
It's nothing. They're just children  playing along..

1272
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:31,619
Wait  I am coming. - Come.

1273
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:34,659
I'll be right.. - Yes.

1274
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:38,659
Don't you have any manners?

1275
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,600
How could you say that in front of Manpreet?

1276
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,529
They're troubling the lady openly  and I can't say it.

1277
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:45,579
Look.

1278
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,640
Get lost.

1279
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,510
 O Goddess.

1280
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:55,539
 O Goddess.

1281
01:16:59,229 --> 01:17:00,729
Please do something.

1282
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,659
I know something can be done.

1283
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:05,659
Look  I know Mr. Baweja was an honest man.

1284
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,680
 But  I cannot do anything now.

1285
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,659
The orders are from the court.

1286
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,670
You have only 5 days left.

1287
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,630
Try to convince the investors to withdraw the case.

1288
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,500
 Otherwise  I'll have to do my duty.

1289
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,510
Just a minute.

1290
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,550
Hello. - Aunt. Balwant here.

1291
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:35,689
There's no money anywhere.

1292
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,659
I don't thing Goddess is supporting us.

1293
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:41,710
Now you do something. - Fine.

1294
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,680
 Play on.

1295
01:18:19,149 --> 01:18:20,649
 Play on.

1296
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,550
 Play on.

1297
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,560
Excuse me. - Sir.

1298
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,670
Sir. - Who's your senior manager? Call him right now.

1299
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,659
 Tell me  sir. I am here for you.

1300
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:55,720
I ordered for soya sauce 15 minutes back.

1301
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:58,590
How do you expect me to eat my sushi?

1302
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:00,569
Sir  we're expecting a special guest.. - So?

1303
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,520
There she is.

1304
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,680
 Hello  ma'am. So pleased to see you.

1305
01:19:08,029 --> 01:19:09,179

..of our hotel especially for you. Please  come. - Come.

1307
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:13,529
Hello. Hello  Mrs. Mehta. Good to see you.

1308
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,680
After a long time.

1309
01:19:17,029 --> 01:19:18,529
Where were you? - I was off to Milan  for the power project.

1310
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,188
 And  how's your party doing?

1311
01:19:24,189 --> 01:19:25,689
It's running on your funds.

1312
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,500
Don't embarrass me  I trust your party.

1313
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:31,569
Thank you  ma'am. - Thank you.

1314
01:19:32,029 --> 01:19:33,529
Allow me.

1315
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,640
Thank you.

1316
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,699
 Excuse me  sir.

1317
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,118
That's the limit.

1318
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:48,619
 I ordered for soya sauce  what's this?

1319
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:50,569
Sir  this is a bottle of rare wine from Mrs. Hansal Mehta.

1320
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,500
Especially for you.

1321
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,600
Mrs. Hansal Mehta. If you don't mind  can I ask a question?

1322
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,659
What do you do?

Hansal Plaza  Hansal Mall  Hansal Arcade.

1326
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,720
You're well known from Gurgaon to Delhi to Noida.

1327
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:26,510
 It's my pleasure to meet you  madam.

1328
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,590
 Likewise  my pleasure.

1329
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:32,590
It's great meeting Aman Kapoor  the big star.

1330
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,520
I wish Sailja was here. - Who?

1331
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:39,710
My daughter  Sailja. - I see.

1332
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,670
She's a big fan of yours.

1333
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:43,569
In fact  both my children are big fan of yours.

1334
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:46,729
They don't miss a single episode.

1335
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,560
Sailja even records all your episodes.

1336
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,560
I see.

1337
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,600
So  you're here on a shoot. - No  no.

1338
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:58,699
 Actually  Aman's getting married.

1339
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,600
Mr. Sabharwal's daughter.

1340
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,108
What was her name? - Gudiya.

1341
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:04,609
Gudiya.

1342
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,560
I'm sure you know him.

1343
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:11,579
Actually  Mr. Sabharwal bought the land..

1344
01:21:13,149 --> 01:21:14,649
..for his bank and school from Hansal Real Estate.

1345
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,600
 But  the payment's still due.

1346
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,520
Shut up. Let's not talk about it. - Sorry.

1347
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,550
Congrats in advance  son. - Thank you so much.

1348
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,659
 Excuse me  ma'am.

1349
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,158
This is the limited edition watch..

1350
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:32,659
..the one you ordered for your son.

1351
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,500
It's come.

1352
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:52,510
Wow. That is classy.

1353
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:54,720
Fabulous. - You like it?

1354
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:58,118
Keep it.

1355
01:21:58,119 --> 01:21:59,619
Your wedding gift. - No.

1356
01:22:00,109 --> 01:22:01,228
What no?

1357
01:22:01,229 --> 01:22:02,729
You shouldn't say no to your elders.

1358
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,699
Take it. She's giving it with love. Keep it.

1359
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,560
Take it. - Thanks.

1360
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,630
Instead of Mrs. Hansal Mehta  can I call you aunt.. - Stupid.

1361
01:22:18,029 --> 01:22:19,529
She's like your aunt.

1362
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,500
And she has to attend your wedding.

1363
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,520
Otherwise  we won't take this gift. Give it back.

1364
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,539
 Are you coming  or not?

1365
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:33,590
Check that.

1366
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,720
Excuse me. I'll be right back from the restroom.

1367
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,520
Okay. Come back soon.

1368
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:44,659
Hello!

1369
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,710
 No  no. No  Mr. Sabharwal.

1370
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:49,550
I've told you so many times stop calling madam.

1371
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:53,510
We're not interested in doing any business with you.

1372
01:22:56,119 --> 01:22:57,619
 Ok. And  please don't call again.

1373
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:13,590
 Son  what are you doing?

1374
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:15,649
So many brownies? Tell me what's bothering you. - You know it  dad.

1375
01:23:18,109 --> 01:23:19,609
When Aman's stressed  Aman eats brownies.

1376
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:21,630
 Yeah  but what's the problem.

1377
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:23,560
 That Sabharwal  he's a big time fraud.

1378
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,500
And  you brought this proposal. - Yes  I did.

1379
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,500
You needed 1.5 billion to launch your future film.

1380
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,148
 But  what's wrong?

1381
01:23:32,149 --> 01:23:33,649
Once the marriage is done with. - Yes.

1382
01:23:34,029 --> 01:23:35,529
And refuses to give the money at the reception? - No.

1383
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,500
That's not possible. - I'm telling you  dad.

1384
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,680
Don't take a risk.

1385
01:23:43,029 --> 01:23:44,529
 And anyway  I've decided.

1386
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,729
Decided what?

1387
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:49,510
 First the money  then the marriage.

1388
01:23:52,029 --> 01:23:53,529
Listen to this. - Go ahead.

1389
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:56,659
Boyfriend: If I kiss you what will you think of me?

1390
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:03,510
Girlfriend: Stupid.

1391
01:24:04,119 --> 01:24:05,228
Why?

1392
01:24:05,229 --> 01:24:06,729
Girlfriend:

1393
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,520
If you taste only pickle  instead of the entire plate..

1394
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:11,579
..then you're stupid.

1395
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,640
Your phone.. - Hello. - Mr. Sabharwal.

1396
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:21,179
Yes.

1397
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,680
I had to say something important. - Go ahead.

1398
01:24:25,109 --> 01:24:26,609
The dowry amount  that was decided between us..

1399
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:30,569
..we want them before the marriage. - What's wrong?

1400
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:34,670
 Nothing  it's a personal requirement.

1401
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,630
I'll tell you later. - But  Mr. Kapoor  we had agreed that..

1402
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:42,710
..the money will be given in Mumbai during the reception.

1403
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:45,550
 No  we want it before the wedding.

1404
01:24:46,029 --> 01:24:47,529
Just make the arrangements. Yes.

1405
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:49,539
Listen..

1406
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:51,510
Okay?

1407
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:53,729
Now you acted more like Aman's dad.

1408
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:57,729
I'm your father after all.

1409
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,640
Fool.

1410
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,600
There's a problem. - Go ahead.

1411
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:19,539
I had an agreement with Tej Kapoor..

1412
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:21,520
..that the dowry money will be given at the reception  in Mumbai.

1413
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,550
 But  he's gone back on his words.

1414
01:25:25,109 --> 01:25:26,609
 He wants the money first  only then..

1415
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:28,710
..will he go ahead with the marriage.

1416
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:30,710
So.. please arrange the bank money that I kept with you..

1417
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,550
..I'm coming to get them.

1418
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,510
Stay there. - Why? What happened?

1419
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:39,659
Saturn's fury is at its last stage.

1420
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,720
I don't want any obstructions in Gudiya's marriage.

1421
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,720
Make preparations for the steps I told you to take..

1422
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:51,649
..to escape Saturn's fury.

1423
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,630
I'll get the money personally.

1424
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,500
Bagga. Have you arranged for 100 Brahmins..

1425
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:03,699
..before the wedding? - Yes.

1426
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:05,699
All the arrangements have been done.

1427
01:26:07,149 --> 01:26:08,649
What's wrong?

1428
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:20,049
The money's reached the farmhouse.

1429
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,550
I'll return you every penny.

1430
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:24,590
With interest.

1431
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:26,640
Just have faith.

1432
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:37,630
Why the long face?

1433
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:39,590
Make a happy face. You're getting married today.

1434
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:41,710
So what if I'm getting married.

1435
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,179
That cheat Sabharwal said..

1436
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,680
..the groom will descend in a helicopter. Where's the helicopter?

1437
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,520
Superstar Aman's riding on a peacock shaped chariot.

1438
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:50,609
I won't step inside without seeing the money.

1439
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:53,510
Tell me this. When I didn't get married without seeing the money..

1440
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:56,689
..I won't let you either. Don't worry.

1441
01:26:58,039 --> 01:26:59,539
Once you get the money  buy yourself a helicopter. Okay?

1442
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,590
 Now  smile.

1443
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,510
Come on. Start playing.

1444
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,600
I think I've seen them before.

1445
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:56,659
I just..

1446
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,500
Sabharwal. Congratulations.

1447
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,640
Congratulations. - Congratulations to you too.

1448
01:28:10,229 --> 01:28:11,729
Let me introduce you.

1449
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:13,590
She's Mrs. Hansal Mehta from Hansal Group of Companies.

1450
01:28:15,149 --> 01:28:16,649
She's like family.

1451
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,209
Special guest.

1452
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,710
Come in. Come. - Come on.

1453
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:22,510
Dad.

1454
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,550
Sabharwal  I forgot to say something. - Yes.

1455
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:27,710
Aman wanted to see the bride once.

1456
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:31,720
Son  you can't before the marriage.. - No!

1457
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:34,659
 Sabharwal  you didn't get it.

1458
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,710
Bride.. - Okay  come in.

1459
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:40,068
Come. Come. - Come in.

1460
01:28:40,069 --> 01:28:41,569
Come on.

1461
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:43,729
Come on.

1462
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:46,539
 There you go  bro.

1463
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,600
 You see  Sabharwal.

1464
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:51,510
I want to tell you something personal.

1465
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,600
If it wasn't an emergency  I wouldn't have troubled you.

1466
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,720
Sir  this is no trouble at all. - Yes.

1467
01:28:58,069 --> 01:28:59,569
Whether you slit the hen at the shop or the jungle.

1468
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:02,539
 But  its fate decided.

1469
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:04,158
 Sorry  sorry.

1470
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,659
Son-in-law. The money isn't going anywhere.

1471
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:08,590
The money's safe here.

1472
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,089
Not to worry. - Yes.

1473
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,590
Bagga. Tell him a new joke.

1474
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,630
He's a good man.

1475
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:16,630
You've trained him well.

1476
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:18,520
You just snap your fingers 'Bagga.. Bagga..'

1477
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,500
 Kapoor  he's the dog that never barks.

1478
01:29:22,039 --> 01:29:23,539
Only cracks jokes.

1479
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:27,510
Tell us.

1480
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,158
Come on.

1481
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:30,659
Tell us.

1482
01:29:31,029 --> 01:29:32,529
Stop. Stop.

1483
01:29:33,149 --> 01:29:34,649
You start instantly.

1484
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,600
 You see  Sabharwal.

1485
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:38,550
It's my son's wedding  you think we're here to listen to jokes.

1486
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:41,209
Not at all.

1487
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:42,710
Bro  I've arranged a wonderful program for you.

1488
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:46,619
You'll be amazed.

1489
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:49,630
You're going to have fun. Let's go. - Come on.

1490
01:29:51,029 --> 01:29:52,529
 Bagga  wait here.

1491
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:04,710
 Night of bliss.

1492
01:30:07,149 --> 01:30:08,649
 Beloved's hot-hot.

1493
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:12,510
 Night of bliss.

1494
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,228
 Beloved's hot-hot.

1495
01:30:14,229 --> 01:30:15,729
I'm capturing my beloved's image through my eyes.

1496
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:19,619
 I'll sway  play hard to get.

1497
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,500
 I'll sway  play hard to get.

1498
01:30:25,149 --> 01:30:26,649
 Beware my beloved.

1499
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:30,118
Sukhi..

1500
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:31,619
 I'll do the serpent.. serpent dance.

1501
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:38,619
 I'll do the serpent.. serpent dance.

1502
01:30:58,109 --> 01:30:59,609
 The shiny nose-ring pin.

1503
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:03,510
 The danglers in my ears.

1504
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,710
 The shiny nose-ring pin.

1505
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:08,710
 The danglers in my ears.

1506
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,640
Are only for you  they stole your heart.

1507
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,510
 Beloved  my plan is.

1508
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,670
 Beloved  my plan is.

1509
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,550
 I won't let go of you so easily.

1510
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:26,550
 I'll do the serpent.. serpent dance.

1511
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,560
 I'll do the serpent.. serpent dance.

1512
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,560
 Gulp down that drink.

1513
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,670
 And groove on the floor.

1514
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:54,520
 Dance with me  darling.

1515
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:57,640
 Now get up from that seat.

1516
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,640
 Or I won't spare you  I'll bite you.

1517
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:05,590
 Or I won't spare you  I'll bite you.

1518
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,720
 I won't step back.

1519
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:15,659
 I'll do the serpent.. serpent dance.

1520
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:22,659
 I'll do the serpent.. serpent dance.

1521
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,659
 I'll do the serpent.. serpent dance.

1522
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:36,710
 I'll do the serpent.. serpent dance.

1523
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:44,539
 ..serpent dance.

1524
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:47,710
Thank you.

1525
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:50,550
Do give your blessings.

1526
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:52,550
Thank you.

1527
01:32:55,029 --> 01:32:56,529
Come on. Please.

1528
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:58,510
Keep moving.

1529
01:33:13,149 --> 01:33:14,649
Mr. Aman Kapoor. Call for you.

1530
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:18,108
Who is it? - Don't know.

1531
01:33:18,109 --> 01:33:19,609
But he says it's important. It's urgent.

1532
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,720
Hello. - Praise the Divine Mother!

1533
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,670
You're being fooled. - What?

1534
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,510
What nonsense.

1535
01:33:32,029 --> 01:33:33,529
And  who are you? - I am Obama. Listen to me carefully.

1536
01:33:35,229 --> 01:33:36,729
You've been duped big time.

1537
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:38,619
The money  for which you're getting married..

1538
01:33:39,149 --> 01:33:40,649
..has disappeared from the bag.

1539
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:42,219
Forget the movie.

1540
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:43,720
You can't even make an ad film now.

1541
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:47,630
Check the bag before the nuptials.

1542
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:49,640
 Otherwise  you'll be the loser.

1543
01:33:50,109 --> 01:33:51,609
Hello.

1544
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:53,520
Hello.

1545
01:33:57,189 --> 01:33:58,689
What's wrong? - What happened?

1546
01:34:00,039 --> 01:34:01,078
What happened? - What happened?

1547
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:02,579
It's nothing. I'll be right back. Wait here.

1548
01:34:03,159 --> 01:34:04,659
What did he say? - What?

1549
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:06,720
 Listen to me  son.

1550
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:12,699
What happened? Who was it? - Don't know.

1551
01:34:18,189 --> 01:34:19,689
Dad. Stop this sham.

1552
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:22,680
They take us for fools.

1553
01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:27,219
 What's this  uncle?

1554
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:28,720
What is all this?

1555
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:30,520
See. The money has disappeared from the bag.

1556
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,640
And.. these papers..

1557
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,680
What do you want me to do with them?

1558
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,520
I warned you. They're frauds. - Hey!

1559
01:34:40,189 --> 01:34:41,689
 Mr. Sabharwal  what's this?

1560
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,078
Where's the money?

1561
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:45,579
 Where's the money  Sabharwal?

1562
01:34:46,109 --> 01:34:47,609
 Hold on. Hold on  Mr. Kapoor.

1563
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:49,510
Even I would like to know where my money is.

1564
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:54,670
Let's go inside and talk.

1565
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:56,510
 Sabharwal  let's talk here.

1566
01:34:58,090 --> 01:34:59,129
In front of everyone.

1567
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:00,630
And  where's the money? - The money..

1568
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:03,510
 You saw the money yourself  and..

1569
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:05,630
Bagga!

1570
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:07,680
Bagga!

1571
01:35:08,199 --> 01:35:09,699
Bagga!

1572
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,500
Bagga! Where's he?

1573
01:35:13,229 --> 01:35:14,729
He was supposed to look after the money. Where is he?

1574
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,659
What's happening with me?

1575
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,600
 Don't act innocent  Sabharwal.

1576
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,520
You wanted to trick us into the marriage..

1577
01:35:24,130 --> 01:35:25,630
With your average daughter.. - Hey!

1578
01:35:26,109 --> 01:35:27,609
Shut up!

1579
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,680
Don't you dare say a word about my daughter.

1580
01:35:33,079 --> 01:35:34,579
Or I won't spare you. - Brother-in-law's right.

1581
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,640
We've seen many TV stars like you.

1582
01:35:39,069 --> 01:35:40,569
No need to endure anymore humiliation  brother-in-law.

1583
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:42,710
 Hey you  TV Star.

1584
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:44,609
You and your guests just get the hell out of here!

1585
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:46,670
Stop this nonsense.

1586
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,500
Enough of this sham.

1587
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,209
 Dad  the wedding's cancelled.

1588
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:51,710
Get out of here. - Wait. The wedding's definitely cancelled.

1589
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:54,710
Let me talk to him.

1590
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:56,640
Sabharwal. Hansal Mehta had already told me..

1591
01:36:00,189 --> 01:36:01,689
..that you're a big fraud.

1592
01:36:02,119 --> 01:36:03,619
But  I cannot believe you can stoop so low..

1593
01:36:07,159 --> 01:36:08,659
..and cheat in your own daughter's wedding.. - Shut up!

1594
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:11,659
 Rascal! Shut up  you rascal!

1595
01:36:13,159 --> 01:36:14,659
Shut up!

1596
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:16,550
Do you know who you're talking to?

1597
01:36:17,109 --> 01:36:18,609
Sabharwal! This is my empire!

1598
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:20,619
Who's this Mrs. Hansal?

1599
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,500
Tell me. Who knows me better? Who is it?

1600
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:24,569
Tell me.

1601
01:36:28,109 --> 01:36:29,609
I am not Mrs. Hansal Mehta.

1602
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:34,539
Who are you? - Jasbeer Baweja.

1603
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,640
Ravinder Baweja's wife.

1604
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:41,680
 Oh? Can't understand  Sabharwal?

1605
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:45,590
 Wait a minute  aunt.

1606
01:36:46,029 --> 01:36:47,529
We'll explain him with little jolts.

1607
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,659
We tricked the principal of your school Sethi..

1608
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:53,520
..and robbed you of 300 million.

1609
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:55,729
'What brings you here?'

1610
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,680
'You didn't visit the school for a long time..'

1611
01:37:00,069 --> 01:37:01,569
'..so  I just wanted to see if you're okay.'

1612
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:05,640
And then  we raided your dairy as well.

1613
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,630
 'Brother-in-law  there's a problem.'

1614
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:12,680
'There's been a raid at the dairy.'

1615
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,619
The video-recording has already been delivered to the police.

1616
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:17,710
And then  we made you dance to our tunes..

1617
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:20,600
..to take your money.

1618
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,500
Manpreet!

1619
01:37:24,119 --> 01:37:25,619
Rascals. You don't know who I am.

1620
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:29,579
We know who you are.

1621
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:32,520
My father lost his life because of you.

1622
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:35,659
And sister-in-law Saira's still in jail.

1623
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:38,550
I am Sukhwinder Baweja  Ravinder Baweja's son.

1624
01:37:41,109 --> 01:37:42,609
I swore to restore my father's reputation.

1625
01:37:45,229 --> 01:37:46,729
Just like you robbed the investors..

1626
01:37:50,069 --> 01:37:51,569
..and put the blame on Mr. Baweja.

1627
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:53,560
Similarly  we robbed you of your money.

1628
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,500
Robbed my money.

1629
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:01,590
Just try to take that money out of Sabharwal's house.

1630
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,500
The money's already left the farm house.

1631
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:08,680
 And  you've personally returned..

1632
01:38:10,069 --> 01:38:11,569
..the investors their money with interest.

1633
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:13,550
Fool.

1634
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:18,579
'Come on. Please.'

1635
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,560
'Keep moving.'

1636
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,500
Sir.

1637
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:30,560
How about a joke?

1638
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,670
Forget it.

1639
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:35,579
 Today  you're the joke.

1640
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:39,600
 Bagga  you..

1641
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,720
You betrayed your own employer.

1642
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,520
And yes  Sabharwal's killed many Bawejas  and now..

1643
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,520
Papa. - Gudiya  move.

1644
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,560
Move aside. Move!

1645
01:38:59,159 --> 01:39:00,659
That's enough.

1646
01:39:02,199 --> 01:39:03,699
I could never imagine..

1647
01:39:06,029 --> 01:39:07,529
..you could do such a thing.

1648
01:39:12,069 --> 01:39:13,569
After mom's death  you were everything for me.

1649
01:39:18,039 --> 01:39:19,539
My hero.

1650
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:22,640
But you hurt me.

1651
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:25,619
Go away from here.

1652
01:39:28,149 --> 01:39:29,649
Please go away.

1653
01:39:36,039 --> 01:39:37,539
 This had to happen  Sabharwal.

1654
01:39:41,069 --> 01:39:42,569
You can't get a bigger punishment.

1655
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:47,579
Mr. Baweja's soul is finally at peace now.

1656
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:02,729
In view of all the statements and witnesses..

1657
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:05,680
..the court sentences Mohan Sabharwal..

1658
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:08,520
..to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment.

1659
01:40:16,109 --> 01:40:17,609
'Life didn't stop with Sabharwal's punishment.

1660
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,520
Sukhi and Manpreet got married.

1661
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:23,579
Granny got her free cable TV connection.

1662
01:40:24,189 --> 01:40:25,689
Mintu's seen less cooking and more in religious parties.

1663
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:28,640
Ballu was always a fixer  and he still is.

1664
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:31,670
Kabootar got admission  without the donation.

1665
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,560
And  Bagga found a big family to tell his jokes.

1666
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:38,520
 But  our mom's truly amazing.

1667
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,560
We've seen many super-heroes..

1668
01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:42,659
..but  not a super-heroine like our mom.

1669

 And a bad heart.

1687
01:42:04,229 --> 01:42:05,729
When someone pollutes the world  we calm him down.

1688
