00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,550
Hello.

2
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,590
This is Kalpana Chawla 
welcoming my viewers from Tundla.

3
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,800
The wedding preparations 
that you can see behind me...

4
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,960
...is for the richest man in the city 
Chironjee Lal's daughter Kusum Kali.

5
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,710
Yes...

6
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,500
He's hired the best cooks 
from around Uttar Pradesh...

7
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,420
...and he's booked, Arena Grande 
and also invited Madhuri Dixit.

8
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,130
Madhuri Dixit is my favourite too

9
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,800
I've also heard that the bride's 
gown costs at least 10 million.

10
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,710
Hey, mister...

11
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Who are you?

12
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,750
Gullu...

13
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,840
...the name must ring a bell.

14
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,750
Sir, you?

15
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,550
I rob every individual weddings and party.

16
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,630
Today is your lucky day.

17
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,250
Grab the camera.

18
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,460
No, please! Listen to me...

19
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,500
This is the biggest 
wedding in Tundla to date.

20
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,710
There'll be no screaming, 
yelling or shouting.

21
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,710
Take out all your gold 
and put it in this bag.

22
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,380
Be warned that 
I am just not a murderer...,

23
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,250
but a very merciless one.

24
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,340
You all have just 10 to12 minutes.

25
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,550
Come on.

26
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,170
Take it all off. 
I said take it off.

27
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,550
Hey...uncle.

28
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,630
Come here.

29
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
I said come here.

30
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,340
Stand in front.

31
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,630
- What are you hiding in the pocket? 
- Nothing, son.

32
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,550
Raise your hands.

33
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,590
- But son... 
- I said raise your hands.

34
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,130
Why are you carrying sweets?

35
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,170
The pocket is torn, son.

36
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,000
Get lost.

37
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,630
Out of my sight.

38
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,710
Someone bring some 
acid to wash my hands.

39
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,170
Police?

40
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,630
- Boss, there's a way out this side. 
- Sir, it's the Gullu Gang, sir.

41
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,920
You two, keep an eye.

42
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,670
Come on.

43
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
Afzal. We're leaving now.

44
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,090
As planned, 
meet me behind Hanuman temple.

45
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,710
From there we'll head 
to the railway station.

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Has sir arrived?

47
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Yes, he's on the way.

48
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,710
Aladdin's lamp.

49
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,380
Chotu, what are you doing?

50
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,920
The genie will appear...

51
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,420
The genie will appear 
and double this gold.

52
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,250
Ok, carry on.

53
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,300
What's happening?

54
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,050
I told you.

55
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Go on. Go on.

56
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,920
What's going on?

57
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,460
Good day.

58
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,500
My name is Chulbul Pandey.

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,630
Aka Robin Hood Pandey.

60
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,840
Welcome me.

61
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,000
Get me down.

62
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,960
- Boss... 
- Yes...

63
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
Catch him.

64
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,300
Pick it up. Pick it up.

65
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,550
Grab the loot.

66
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,710
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

67
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,500
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

68
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,300
Hands up.

69
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,590
"Khatna" (Circumcision)!

70
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,250
Get lost.

71
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,880
Good gracious!

72
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,460
Mr. Gullo.

73
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,090
Don't you read the statuary warning?

74
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,420
Cigarette and Tobacco 
are injurious to health.

75
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,090
- Welcome to... 
- The new SP Chulbul Pandey...

76
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,000
- Welcome to... 
- The new SP Chulbul Pandey...

77
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,550
- Long live... 
- The new SP Chulbul Pandey...

78
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,050
- Tiwari, and Chaubey. 
- Yes, sir.

79
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,670
- And Pichkari too. 
- Yes, sir.

80
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,000
Ask him about his case history?

81
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,590
So Gullu, what did you before getting 
into looting and plundering?

82
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,250
Before that, I was a thief.

83
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,420
Has he ever done a decent job?

84
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,630
Sir, no one's a born criminal.

85
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,340
I used to be part of a wedding band.

86
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,380
- Band... 
- I honestly did, sir.

87
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,220
- That's our tune, sir. 
- Yes...

88
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,140
"I have my pledges..."

89
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,220
"...and my choices."

90
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,180
"I have my pledges..."

91
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,850
"...and my choices."

92
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,600
"I've my own style..."

93
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,220
"...my own foundation."

94
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,890
"I've my share of darkness..."

95
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,550
"...and my own tales."

96
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,180
"I am a free man..."

97
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,220
"...a follower of my God."

98
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,890
"I am fearless...fearless...fearless..."

99
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:25,300
"I am fearless...fearless...fearless..."

100
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,890
"Fearless one..."

101
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,510
"Fearless one..."

102
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,220
"Fearless one..."

103
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,720
"I am fearless...fearless...fearless..."

104
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,800
You tell, sir.

105
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,800
Not up to the mark, sir. 
Not working.

106
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,010
Really?

107
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,470
Then look at this.

108
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,510
"A true friend to for his friends."

109
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,350
"A sword that slays his enemies."

110
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,930
"The lion doesn't blink when 
his prey is in sight."

111
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:26,470
"When God's my benefactor, 
the world's at his feet."

112
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,220
"I've my own shores..."

113
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,930
"...and waves of my own."

114
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,600
"I am a free man..."

115
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,550
"...a follower of my God."

116
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,220
"I am fearless...fearless...fearless..."

117
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,640
"I am fearless...fearless...fearless..."

118
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,180
"Fearless one..."

119
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,970
"Fearless one..."

120
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,640
"Fearless one..."

121
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,300
"I am fearless...fearless...fearless..."

122
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,480
Can't you see the water's overflowing? 
Don't you have sense?

123
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,270
Without water, no one will survive.

124
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,940
Plants and trees will die.

125
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,980
Without plants and trees, 
we'll have no oxygen.

126
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,400
And without oxygen, 
there will be no H2O.

127
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,100
Meaning 3rd World War.

128
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,350
Don't you watch the news?

129
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,350
Hey...

130
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,100
Do you all want a beating as well?

131
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,350
Come on.

132
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
She's absolutely right.

133
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,150
You're absolutely right, 
sister-in-law.

134
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,900
"Fire burns in his heart."

135
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
"He's an unsung melody."

136
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,560
"Everyone screams his name 
when he enters the battlefield."

137
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:10,770
"Anyone who challenges him, 
doesn't live to tell the tale."

138
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,900
"I've my own abode..."

139
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,480
"...and my own spring."

140
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,150
"I am a free man..."

141
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,190
"...a follower of my God."

142
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,900
"I am fearless...fearless...fearless..."

143
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,900
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

144
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,560
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

145
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,190
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

146
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,940
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

147
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,650
"Your bewitching eyes..."

148
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,690
"...makes my heart skip a beat."

149
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,690
"...steal my heart's bane."

150
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,850
"Your bewitching eyes..."

151
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,770
"...makes my heart skip a beat."

152
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,190
"Your bewitching eyes..."

153
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,060
"...makes my heart skip a beat."

154
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,560
- Thief. Thief. 
- You can't win.

155
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,310
- Bittu. 
- Thief. Thief. Thief.

156
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,650
What happened?

157
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,600
- What happened? 
- Nothing.

158
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,730
And even my moustache is safe.

159
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,940
Mr. Pandey, you to much.

160
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,980
Mr. Pandey...

161
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,060
Our son is playing cops and robbers.

162
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,310
Can I teach you something?

163
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,980
At this age.

164
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,900
Learning has nothing to do with age.

165
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,190
I see.

166
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,600
Hey Ram...

167
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,560
"I wanna jalwa"

168
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,690
With that sunflower brand grown 
on your head...

169
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,270
...and in this age of global warming, 
why are you secretly watching...

170
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,270
...husband and wife's romance.

171
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,650
I am taking lessons, sir.

172
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,350
I'll try it when I go home.

173
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,150
Unnecessarily, 
You're making my wife conscious.

174
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,480
- Get lost. 
- Sir...

175
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,820
Okay, sir.

176
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,450
- So what do you think? 
- Enjoy, sir.

177
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,990
Mr. Pandey, I'm very busy right now.

178
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,450
I've to get Bittu ready for school.

179
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,780
Where is Makkhi?

180
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,820
Where is Makkhi?

181
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,110
Don't worry, I am wearing shorts.

182
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,610
- Thief. Thief. 
- Time out.

183
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,070
- ...Sixty-four. 
- Caught you.

184
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,200
I've to go. It's urgent.

185
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,990
...Sixty-five...

186
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,110
Come on, Makkhi.

187
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,700
...Sixty-six...

188
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,530
My son.

189
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,030
- Papa, let me go. 
- ...Sixty-seven...

190
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,900
Go on.

191
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,360
...Sixty-eight...

192
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,700
Fifty-nine...

193
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,200
...Fifty-nine.

194
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,900
- Sixty... 
- ...Sixty...

195
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,030
Chulbul, stop troubling him.

196
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,030
Don't worry Papa, I feel 
like an older brother around him.

197
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,030
Brother, you got me confused.

198
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,360
...Sixty-one...

199
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,400
Do you see papa how Makkhan 
Singh Pandey's maintained himself?

200
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,700
Thank you, brother.

201
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,700
I am working really hard.

202
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,070
My almonds.

203
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,400
...Sixty-three.

204
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,700
- I'm feeling embarrassed watching... 
- ...Sixty-four

205
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,780
...your hard work.

206
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,530
- But why are you working so hard? 
- ...Sixty-five...

207
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,110
To stay fit.

208
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,860
Milk too.

209
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,780
Fit India Movement.

210
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,860
But why do you want to stay fit?

211
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,110
It boosts confidence, 
and morale.

212
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,700
Dates...

213
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,990
Makkhi uncle, come quickly.

214
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,900
Makkhi, I guess is a big job for you.

215
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,950
Inside the house.

216
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,780
Go on.

217
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,400
Uncle, take the hose and clean it.

218
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,610
I just pooped.

219
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,650
You're 7-years-old.

220
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,280
Why can't you clean it yourself?

221
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,860
I can...

222
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,150
If you can, then why don't you?

223
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,280
Because...I like your moustache.

224
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,450
If you like my moustache so much...

225
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,490
...then give me a job 
that suits me.

226
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,820
I can utilize this time 
to apprehend a criminal.

227
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,990
Go on.

228
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,280
I've to go too.

229
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,570
Should I wait to clean after you?

230
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,950
Or can you do it yourself?

231
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,700
Get lost.

232
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,860
Mom...

233
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,820
Get out. Get out.

234
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,610
Shit. Bull shit.

235
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,530
What was that terrible smell?

236
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
Rajjo.

237
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,860
Where is my toothbrush?

238
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,780
You're using my toothbrush to put 
drawstring in whose petticoat?

239
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,450
Whose?

240
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,700
Mine.

241
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,900
Why are you using my toothbrush to put 
a drawstring in my wife's petticoat.

242
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,030
Try to remember where Chhedi Singh 
and Bacha Singh's hid their money.

243
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,400
Chhedi? Baccha?

244
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,360
Who are they?

245
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,740
Otherwise, I'll put so many holes...

246
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,450
Aah... I don't want any 
holes in my petticoat.

247
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,610
- I'll put so many... 
- Aah...

248
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,400
Come along and bring the petticoat.

249
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,070
Mr. Chulbul Pandey is putting 
drawstring in his wife's petticoat.

250
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,530
Papa, I've seen you 
wash mom's petticoat...

251
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,700
...and even wear it.

252
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,570
How romantic, papa.

253
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,860
Rajjo.

254
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,900
Rajjo.

255
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,000
Amazing.

256
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,960
Officer... Where's the officer?

257
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,750
There.

258
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,090
Delicious.

259
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,210
Sir...

260
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,710
Some guys kidnapped us...

261
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,550
...so they can sell... 
Sir, please help us.

262
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,380
Sir...

263
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,460
Yes...

264
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,670
Don't be afraid.

265
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,300
Now tell me about your case in detail.

266
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,340
Sir, some people kidnapped 
us from various places...

267
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,590
...so they can sell us.

268
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,880
- "Get down...come on..." 
- "Please let us go home."

269
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,170
They beat us and torture us.

270
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,960
I'll show you...

271
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,500
She's got an attitude.

272
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,500
Sir, please do something immediately...

273
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,380
...otherwise they will take 
the girls away.

274
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,550
Their lives will be ruined. 
Please, sir.

275
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,000
I won't let their lives be ruined.

276
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,050
I am here.

277
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,590
Come with me. Come on.

278
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,460
Hey...

279
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,210
Stop whatever you're doing here!

280
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,340
You won't take a 
single girl out of here.

281
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,130
If you don't have a death wish...

282
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,840
...then surrender right now.

283
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,460
'So many of them.'

284
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,000
'Scr***'

285
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,880
Brother, 
I'll deal with these two jokers.

286
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,250
No, Makkhi.

287
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,250
Brother, I am confident.

288
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,800
Okay.

289
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,630
Why you...

290
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,420
Brother!

291
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,630
What are you doing?

292
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,920
You'll get dizzy.

293
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,670
What are you doing?

294
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,710
Brother...

295
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,210
Kill him.

296
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,050
Let's go.

297
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,630
Come on.

298
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,090
Let me go.

299
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,710
Stop this charade. 
I've seen enough.

300
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,000
My girls aren't going anywhere.

301
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,630
The name's Chinti Walia... 
the entire city knows me as Chinti walia

302
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,380
- Chinti Walia's my name. 
- Come on...

303
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,000
How dare you touch me?

304
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,920
I'll strip these uniforms off you.

305
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,210
Great.

306
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,670
What's great?

307
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,340
Even I'm known for raising my hands hard,

308
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,090
Unfortunately due to cultural norms...

309
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,460
...I don't hit women.

310
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,710
So...

311
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,210
Why did you hit me?

312
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,050
Why did you hit me? 
You said you don't hit women.

313
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,840
When a woman doesn't 
respect other women...

314
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,420
...and hands them over to monsters 
for her personal benefit...

315
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,500
...forces them into prostitution 
instead of a good institution...

316
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,670
...in my opinion...

317
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,300
My opinion?

318
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,840
Who am I?

319
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,550
...cannot be a woman.

320
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,420
Am I not a woman.

321
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,840
Don't I look like a woman to you?

322
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,340
If you have the guts, 
then hit me again.

323
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,960
Hit me!

324
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,210
You have guts, brother.

325
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,630
Makkhi says I do...

326
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,000
I have guts.

327
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,130
You're definitely going to jail.

328
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,670
And even if you get bail... 
by mistake

329
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,130
...and if I catch you doing 
something like this again,...

330
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,250
I'll turn this huge body of 150 kgs into 
100 gms and fit it in a small cup,

331
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:40,000
...drown it in some drain.

332
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Makkhi.

333
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,250
Come on. Makkhan Chand Pandey will 
tell you about women empowerment.

334
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
I'll show you... 
I'll show all of you...

335
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,800
There are cops...

336
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,500
...and outlaws.

337
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,050
I am the outlaw cop.

338
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,460
There's good news for all of you.

339
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,630
And the good news is that this is 
the end of bad news for all of you.

340
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,960
You can all go home, 
without any inquiry.

341
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,840
Thank you, sir.

342
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,840
Thank you so much, sir.

343
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,500
God bless you.

344
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,590
Let's go.

345
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,670
- Thank you so much, sir. 
- Thank you so much, sir.

346
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,840
But sir, if these girls go home...

347
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,250
...how will we make a case?

348
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,800
And sir, what about our promotion?

349
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,920
Oh no...

350
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,460
- Promotion? 
- Yes, sir.

351
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,090
Does anyone else 
have a similar thought?

352
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,800
Never, sir. Not at all, sir. 
Not in even in my dreams, sir.

353
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,750
I love you, sir.

354
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,340
I love you too.

355
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,800
I love you too, sir.

356
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,420
Take Tiwari to the hospital...

357
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,300
- Yes, sir. 
- ...and record his statement.

358
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,920
Some goon shot him.

359
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,710
Yes, sir.

360
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,000
Chaubey, come fast.

361
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,090
Looking for promotion.

362
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,840
"It's Friday night.."

363
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,000
Brother.

364
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,630
Brother.

365
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,590
Some guys are here to bail them out.

366
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,840
My people are here to bail me out. 
What will you do now?

367
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,420
What can you do now? 
I am leaving. I am leaving.

368
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,340
Stop.

369
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,500
These are their bail papers.

370
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,130
Now let our men go.

371
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,340
And them too.

372
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,840
Them?

373
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,670
Who them?

374
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,840
Gals.

375
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,090
Gals?

376
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,170
Item.

377
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Item...!

378
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,210
Are you stupid?

379
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,630
Keep calling for little things.

380
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,630
Learn to handle on your own.

381
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,420
This officer is trying 
to show off his power.

382
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,380
Things have turned serious.

383
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,420
Look...

384
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,090
Give the phone to that rascal.

385
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,210
Yes, boss.

386
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,340
Hey...

387
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,670
Don't make me come there 
and show you who's boss.

388
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,590
You have a handsome face. Why 
don't you join the theatre instead?

389
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,670
Sycophant, huh.

390
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,050
I can see it pretty clearly.

391
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,300
Just clear whether you're 
teaspoon or tablespoon.

392
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,380
Wait... Just wait.

393
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,130
- Hello, boss. 
- Get lost.

394
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,460
I'll show you whose boss.

395
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,630
Just wait. I'll show you. 
In 2 minutes I will show you

396
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:27,920
Hey...

397
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:28,800
Yes...

398
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,090
Boss...

399
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,210
Boss...

400
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,340
The officer at Papadganj 
has taken our girls in his custody.

401
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,750
Boss...he's the new SP.

402
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,380
Now you deal with him.

403
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,500
Dhakkad Chand Pandey.

404
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,000
We'll meet.

405
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,800
Chulbul.

406
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,590
She's a very nice girl.

407
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,670
Wants to become a doctor.

408
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,750
And she will make 
a good daughter-in-law.

409
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,880
I'll ask for a big fat dowry.

410
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,210
I am confused.

411
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,840
- She feels more like a sister to me. 
- Makkhi, you're crazy.

412
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,550
Like a sister...

413
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,840
Let me see why she seems 
like a sister to you.

414
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,630
Hello.

415
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,750
I'll tell you why...

416
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,300
...she seems like a 
sister to you, Makhi.

417
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,210
Because she seems like my wife to me.

418
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,210
We'll have to find someone for Makkhi.

419
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,050
You'll either elope with someone or 
romance someone and have a love marriage.

420
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,960
This is why I am saying, mother.

421
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,380
I am in love.

422
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,880
You want to get married.

423
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,460
You have no job, 
no reputation, nor money.

424
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,880
But I do.

425
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,170
How much?

426
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,300
83,350

427
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,050
Mom...

428
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,960
Why should I tell you? 
It's my hard earned money.

429
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,420
No manners also how 
to talk to your father.

430
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,420
And you don't know 
how to behave either.

431
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,630
What do you have? hmm

432
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,420
I have a mother.

433
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,130
Makkhi has a mother and a father.

434
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,050
His father's factory.

435
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,670
A factory that makes money.

436
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,550
Money that brings respect. 
And respect that brings reputation.

437
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,300
Young man, he's far better than you.

438
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,920
Papa, let brother get married first.

439
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,050
- Makkhi. 
- Let's go.

440
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,840
Once he gets married, his 
mental condition will become stable.

441
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,880
Come on.

442
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,790
Won't you welcome us?

443
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,290
Is this courier?

444
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,660
Courier?

445
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,290
We're the Pandey Family.

446
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,080
To talk about our son's marriage.

447
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,120
Marriage?

448
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
Marriage...

449
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,080
Brother...you tell them.

450
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,200
Yes...

451
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,580
Khushi isn't our daughter...

452
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,910
...she is our niece.

453
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,120
I am her uncle, and she is her aunt.

454
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,290
We brother and sister 
have raised her together.

455
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,790
Tell us something about your son.

456
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,120
Hello...

457
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,330
Shall we leave?

458
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,000
I am here, don't worry.

459
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,790
The name Dhakkad perfectly 
fits his personality.

460
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,370
He's a fearless boy.

461
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,830
He's short-tempered and also jovial.

462
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,790
Not afraid to slap 
someone when he's angry.

463
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,250
Sacrifices his own interest 
for the benefit of others.

464
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,000
Washes plates, pounds millet, 
irons, can fix bikes and cars.

465
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,540
Even looks after his mother 
and presses her feet.

466
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,500
He has all these qualities.

467
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,160
And these days it's hard 
to find someone with such qualities.

468
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,410
But we weren't looking 
for anyone like him.

469
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,660
Let's go.

470
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,750
Listen...

471
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,870
Give us some time to think.

472
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,500
Yes, of course.

473
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,330
But before you give me a thought...

474
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,870
...you must decide about the dowry.

475
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,660
- Dowry. 
- Look at his face.

476
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,540
Who's going to offer him dowry?

477
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,700
Your daughter will soon turn 18.

478
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,790
She wants to become a doctor.

479
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
The studies will 
take at least 5 years.

480
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,370
Meaning at least 5-6 million rupees.

481
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,250
Who will give this money?

482
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,660
You or us?

483
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,700
Mister, I think you're 
in the wrong place.

484
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,330
- Let's go. 
- Mom...

485
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,790
Please sit.

486
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,500
We're in the right place.

487
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,120
You're getting us wrong.

488
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,830
We'll give dowry.

489
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,540
You'll give dowry?

490
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,580
Why would you?

491
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,000
I've already accepted your daughter.

492
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,750
It's my duty now.

493
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
She's going to study 
for five more years...

494
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,790
Till then I will...

495
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,910
I'll need at least that much 
time to arrange for the money.

496
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,370
As soon as she becomes a doctor,

497
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,450
I'll marry her.

498
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,660
Until then...

499
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,910
...I am her guardian.

500
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Right.

501
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,700
Bravo, son.

502
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,330
What now?

503
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,290
He wears his heart on his sleeve.

504
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,580
Absolutely.

505
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,660
I really like the boy.

506
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,540
Yes.

507
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,120
Khushi.

508
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,410
Do you play chess?

509
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,950
Yes. It's what I won 
all these trophies for.

510
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,950
Do you play too?

511
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,330
I...

512
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,790
I play snakes and ladders.

513
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,910
And I am champion at it.

514
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,950
Six.

515
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,450
Khushi, whatever is happening, I hope 
your will is involved in this decision too.

516
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,750
DDLJ.

517
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,830
So, other than me...

518
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,160
...what else do you like.

519
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,540
Other than you, 
I like my uncle, aunty...

520
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,620
...and my friend Rajeshwari.

521
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,000
And?

522
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,410
And?

523
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,620
And...

524
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:29,040
...cycling in the rains, Ramleela 
at Gandhi Maidan, Police, Doctor...

525
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,620
...and bulls.

526
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,040
Bulls?

527
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,660
Yes... Bulls.

528
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,120
He's so hard working... 
in the fields

529
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,290
In the fields, the refinery...

530
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,330
What do you do?

531
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,160
I...

532
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,450
I haven't done anything 
significant yet.

533
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,290
But I will now...

534
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,200
Look after you.

535
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,660
Dhakkad, are you planning 
on moving in with her...

536
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,450
...or will come home with us?

537
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,830
Dhakkad?

538
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,620
That's my name.

539
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,790
Why? Don't you like it?

540
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,370
Yes.

541
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,950
But, doesn't suit your personality.

542
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,910
So...what name suits my personality.

543
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,870
Shobha?

544
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,160
Never.

545
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,790
You are very quirky.

546
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,000
So something quirky...

547
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,620
Why not Chulbul?

548
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,660
Chulbul?

549
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,870
'I hated it when my mom 
used to call me by this name.'

550
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,870
'And now...' Chulbul.

551
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,120
Chulbul...

552
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,160
Is it okay?

553
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,290
It's nice.

554
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,290
Nice to meet you.

555
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,290
I am Chulbul Pandey.

556
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,200
Chulbul.

557
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:23,750
"First time...I've been in love."

558
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:29,120
Chulbul for omen, please have a sweet

559
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:38,000
"Without you, 
the world means nothing."

560
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,660
"You're the reason I exist."

561
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:53,500
"The prophet praying to the Lord."

562
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,800
"My sweetheart has an innocent face."

563
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,000
"I don't know about the norms..."

564
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,050
"...nor do I know about the culture."

565
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,000
"I am naive."

566
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,870
"My poor heart..."

567
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,830
"...my heart keeps searching for you."

568
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,540
"My vagabond..."

569
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:34,870
"My vagabond heart 
keeps looking for you."

570
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:57,330
"Not for a couple of days or years..."

571
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:02,040
"...you're mine for generations to come."

572
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:12,540
"All my prayers and my love is 
for you, beloved."

573
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:18,040
"Whenever I pray..."

574
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,330
"...you are all I ask for."

575
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:31,500
"My love for you will never lessen."

576
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:43,620
"My vagabond heart 
keeps looking for you."

577
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,000
I am not addicted to violence...

578
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,210
...unfortunately, has to be done.

579
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,300
Khushi, forget him.

580
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,130
- He's bleeding. 
- It's a Police case.

581
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,130
What is this?

582
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,050
Mister. Mister.

583
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,000
Khushi, forget him. 
We'll get in trouble.

584
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,590
The poor guy will die.

585
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,340
He'll be dead.

586
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:11,800
Call the ambulance.

587
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,000
We're leaving.

588
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,210
You can come later.

589
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,340
What happened?

590
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,170
Listen...

591
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,500
Mister...

592
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,090
Listen...

593
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,800
Mister...

594
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,300
Mister, open your eyes.

595
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,800
You'll be fine.

596
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,130
Brother, 
you made such tall claims.

597
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,340
How will you arrange 
for so much money?

598
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,920
Makkhi, even God supports a good cause.

599
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,590
Hey you... 
Out of the way.

600
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,880
Move... Move... 
Out of the way.

601
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,170
Brother, is everything okay?

602
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,420
Can I still become an uncle?

603
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,130
Yes, I'll make you an uncle, 
and those idiots a lesson.

604
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,460
Help me get up.

605
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:08,460
Makkhi, look at that.

606
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,630
Leave the bike at the 
garage and hurry back.

607
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,630
I'll fix them until then.

608
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,050
Hey...

609
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,300
Who's there?

610
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,460
Dhakkad Chand Chulbul Pandey.

611
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,340
Chulbul Pandey.

612
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,420
Get out of here.

613
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,460
Otherwise, I'll put so many holes in 
your body that you'll be confused...

614
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,210
...which one is for breathing, 
and which one's for farting.

615
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,590
That was a nice one.

616
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,340
I'll definitely use it somewhere.

617
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,250
But after I misuse you.

618
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,630
They are my brothers 
from another mother.

619
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,750
They can even die for me.

620
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,590
They can shoot you.

621
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,710
I teach a lesson who bark too loud.

622
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,840
Brother, he called you a dog.

623
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,750
Dog?

624
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,250
When did I?

625
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,960
Bite him... I mean kill him.

626
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,920
Give that back.

627
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,210
What can you do to me with that?

628
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,460
But I can do this...

629
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,960
Tell your men to sit down.

630
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,340
Do as sir says?

631
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,300
Let me sit.

632
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:14,750
Dhakkad...Chand...Chulbul Pandey.

633
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,840
Mr. Dhakkad Chand Chulbul Pandey.

634
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,130
They listen, don't they?

635
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,170
Curly hair and short hair.

636
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,340
Come forward.

637
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,460
Pull curly hair's 
underwear over his head.

638
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,130
Forgive me.

639
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,420
Bend. Bend.

640
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:58,880
Now pick him up and 
make him lie down there.

641
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,420
You two get up...

642
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,300
Stay in one place 
and keep beating each other.

643
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,210
You stand up.

644
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,210
No violence, sir.

645
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,090
I'll entertain you in another way.

646
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:31,750
How?

647
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,880
"The heart...doesn't listen."

648
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:45,130
"The heart...never listens."

649
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:55,500
"Love isn't easy..."

650
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:59,840
"...but the heart doesn't agree."

651
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:08,000
"The heart...doesn't listen."

652
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,210
Now...kill each other.

653
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,300
Run!

654
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,960
He's not our brother.

655
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:30,000
Come on.

656
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,710
Who did this?

657
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,420
Dhakkad Chand Chulbul Pandey.

658
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,090
10 million...

659
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,380
As I said...

660
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,840
...even God supports a good cause.

661
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,750
Let's go.

662
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,460
Wow...

663
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,130
Such grand arrangements.

664
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,340
One gets to see this only at weddings.

665
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,050
Is Baali sir getting married?

666
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,750
Does the bride's family know?

667
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,090
When Baali's fallen 
in love with someone...

668
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,340
...its a 90% yes.

669
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,170
Oh, God.

670
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,630
100%

671
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,050
Congratulations on the wedding.

672
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,190
Hello.

673
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
Greetings.

674
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,730
Dhakkad speaking.

675
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,060
Can I talk to Khushi?

676
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,850
She's visiting her aunt, son.

677
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,310
So can I request you for her number?

678
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,350
Wow...

679
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,690
Look, mom, 
Khushi is such a fast learner.

680
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,400
That's a good thing.

681
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,190
Soon she will have to learn 
to take care of her home.

682
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,310
Not for a couple 
Of more years, aunty.

683
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,690
Until I finish my studies.

684
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,060
Your husband's so nice.

685
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,560
He'll let you study, 
pay your fee...

686
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:39,900
...and make you a doctor.

687
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,270
In fact, he'll give dowry 
instead of demanding one.

688
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,150
It's hard to find guys 
like them these days.

689
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,940
I wish I find someone like him too.

690
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,940
You will.

691
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,270
Listen...

692
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,770
Find someone similar 
for our daughter as well.

693
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,560
You don't need to say it twice.

694
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,020
Just wait and watch, we'll find 
someone just like him for Rajjo.

695
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,440
Be right back.

696
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,150
Coming. Coming.

697
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,100
Hello.

698
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:19,230
Hello.

699
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,190
Dhakkad Chand Pandey speaking.

700
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:22,940
Wow...Dhakkad.

701
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,650
You're going to have a long life.

702
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,480
We were just talking about you.

703
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,600
Thank you.

704
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,190
Is Khushi around?

705
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,810
We've lots of it here.

706
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,060
Khushi.

707
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,270
It's him on the line for you.

708
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,350
Hello.

709
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,400
Mr. Chulbul.

710
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,270
Mr. Chulbul...

711
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,770
Khushi...

712
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:47,560
Yes...

713
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,310
The good news is...

714
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:53,980
I've arranged the money 
for your studies.

715
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:57,600
Now you're going to study 
and become a doctor.

716
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,190
And after that, we'll get married.

717
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:09,150
What's more, in case you don't want 
to change your surname after marriage...

718
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,150
...I am okay with it.

719
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,770
Okay...

720
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,560
Okay, I'll hang up now.

721
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,560
See...

722
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:05,230
"She's conveyed her feelings..."

723
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,560
"...by skirting her eyes."

724
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:11,770
"As she looked straight at me..."

725
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,600
"...with a smile on her face."

726
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:20,690
"I froze in my place."

727
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,560
"As my eyes met with her..."

728
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,730
"...I couldn't look away."

729
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,850
"...I couldn't look away."

730
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,980
"...I couldn't look away."

731
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:37,100
"...I couldn't look away."

732
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:40,230
"...I couldn't look away."

733
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:43,480
"...I couldn't look away."

734
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,690
"...I couldn't look away."

735
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,810
"...I couldn't look away."

736
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,190
"...I couldn't look away."

737
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:54,720
Congratulations.

738
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,600
Your admission is done.

739
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,470
She can join college from today.

740
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:04,640
And you can collect the receipt 
of the fee from the office.

741
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,720
- Good luck to you. 
- Thank you.

742
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,800
Dhakkad. Take a look.

743
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:16,640
Dhakkad, my name is Baali Singh.

744
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,390
I love Khushi.

745
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,640
Come on...

746
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,680
Come and see what happens 
when love turns to hatred.

747
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:22,970
Chulbul.

748
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,600
Aunty.

749
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,390
Please...

750
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,350
No!

751
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,550
How does that matter?

752
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,470
Huh...?

753
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:24,850
I love her and she loves you.

754
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,180
Even if you leave, 
she won't stop loving you.

755
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,510
That's the problem.

756
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,260
I don't want this love.

757
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:55,720
So I am sacrificing my love...

758
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,470
...save your love if you can.

759
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:48,990
I thought I was fearless...

760
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,990
Right in front of my eyes...

761
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,700
I was right there... 
in my presence

762
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,610
And I was helpless.

763
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,320
I couldn't save anyone.

764
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:14,820
Mr. Pandey, all that happened...

765
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,320
...why didn't you share it with me?

766
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:21,030
I didn't know that Seema aunty 
was your mother.

767
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:23,610
I can share my joys...

768
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,030
...but my sorrow is for me only.

769
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,740
Why should I make anyone else sad?

770
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,320
After that, I was arrested.

771
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,200
I had to face trial 
instead of Baali Singh.

772
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,820
Dhakkad doesn't want to meet anyone.

773
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,570
Life is strange.

774
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,450
Just when I had lost everything... 
then one day

775
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,400
I deal with criminals only every day.

776
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,150
I can tell the good from the bad.

777
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,650
Everyone knows that 
Baali Singh framed you.

778
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,110
He's a powerful man.

779
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,990
First, you need to be bailed 
out of this case...

780
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,990
...and I'll help you do so.

781
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,740
Some of Baali's 
men have been arrested...

782
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,490
...and they are prepared 
to be our approver.

783
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,070
From this point, 
you must choose a new path.

784
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,820
And that path will take 
you to your destination.

785
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,150
In the light of no evidence...

786
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,860
...the court acquits 
Dhakkad Chand Pandey.

787
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,650
Where is my son?

788
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,990
No one gives me a proper answer.

789
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,650
He's been acquitted, 
but he hasn't returned home yet.

790
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,570
I am his mother.

791
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:49,490
At least tell me the truth.

792
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:52,610
Your son insisted 
that I won't tell anyone.

793
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:56,490
He's chosen a new path for himself.

794
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,860
"Fearless one..."

795
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:21,320
"Fearless one..."

796
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,820
"Fearless one..."

797
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,650
"Fearless one..."

798
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,240
Your son isn't just 
Chulbul Pandey anymore.

799
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:32,030
He's Inspector Chulbul Pandey.

800
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:48,650
My son? Police Officer?

801
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,570
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

802
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:54,070
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

803
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:56,570
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

804
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:59,320
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

805
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,030
Where is he now?

806
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,240
He's on the battlefield.

807
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:07,700
After annihilating his enemy, 
he will return victorious.

808
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:10,490
I thought I had closed 
Baali Singh's chapter.

809
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,570
But he has returned.

810
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,570
What now?

811
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,530
What else, father?

812
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:23,860
This is personal.

813
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,700
I will get my revenge.

814
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,400
Go on.

815
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:30,610
Go and get your revenge.

816
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,240
You have nothing to lose.

817
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,610
But he has everything.

818
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,570
Go now and take your revenge.

819
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:40,070
What are you saying?

820
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:41,320
What else should I say?

821
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,820
I've already lost too much in life.

822
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,530
Mom, dad, brother, friend.

823
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,030
I don't want to lose this family.

824
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,280
For Bittu and my sake... 
make a promise

825
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,820
...you'll stay away 
from violence and anger.

826
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:13,990
I promise

827
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,450
I am here to share your pain.

828
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:10,280
"Beloved's eyes..."

829
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:12,070
Try our Bhang, sir.

830
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:14,320
Large, medium, 
small, Baby, super sexy.

831
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,990
Which one would do you want?

832
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,400
Give us something that 
suits our personality.

833
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,820
Baby for me, and for her...

834
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,900
...super sexy.

835
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:37,530
"Deceiving..."

836
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:56,360
"He secretly heard what 
my heart had to say."

837
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:02,780
"And eventually stole all my nights."

838
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:09,200
"You drew me..."

839
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:15,490
"You drew me close pretending 
to love me"

840
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,400
"Beloved's eyes..."

841
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,900
"...turned out to be deceiving."

842
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:25,200
"Deceiving..."

843
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,070
"Deceiving..."

844
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:41,970
"Your eyes conspired..."

845
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:48,430
"...and stole my heart."

846
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:57,760
"Believe me..."

847
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:01,010
"...but God knows...

848
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,390
you're my benefactor."

849
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:10,600
"You're deceitful, 
and so am I..."

850
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:14,180
"Don't love me so much..."

851
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:17,930
"...that I am scared of life."

852
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:25,850
"You drew me..."

853
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:32,510
"You drew me close pretending 
to love me"

854
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,640
"Beloved's eyes..."

855
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,430
"...turned out to be deceiving."

856
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:40,640
"Deceiving..."

857
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,510
"Deceiving..."

858
01:20:56,470 --> 01:21:00,260
Baali Singh confirms his 
association with Lok Satta Party.

859
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,970
Welcome. Welcome, Makkhanchand.

860
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:16,600
Welcome.

861
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,350
- Hello, Minister sir. 
- Hello.

862
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:20,220
Thank you for letting my people go.

863
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:22,720
I could get them out because my 
brother wasn't in the Police Station.

864
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,930
All good, Chinti Walia.

865
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,640
All good.

866
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:30,680
Chinti Walia can never be 
in trouble while you're around.

867
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:32,760
What?

868
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:33,600
Shall I order tea?

869
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,890
Order three cups of tea.

870
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,930
Makkhanchand, your brother 
Chulbul Pandey is a difficult man.

871
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:41,510
Three cups of tea.

872
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,300
I mean...does violence beget anything?

873
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:48,050
He's hot-headed. 
He loses his temper very quickly.

874
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,600
What now?

875
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:51,720
What about me?

876
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,800
Order one for yourself.

877
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:53,640
All right.

878
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,930
Makkhanchand, 
you're a useful man for us.

879
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,640
- You should me... 
- Four cups of tea.

880
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,720
- I mean... 
- Half a cup for me.

881
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,300
A quarter-pound of milk, 
with extra tea leaves.

882
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,720
- Bali Singh... 
- Sugar on the side.

883
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,220
Use the floral cups.

884
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,510
Two biscuits, on my special plate.

885
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,100
Understood.

886
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:21,430
You should definitely meet 
my friend and partner, Baali Singh.

887
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:22,680
Of course.

888
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,930
We'll all work together.

889
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,430
What is it now?

890
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,470
Spoon on the side or inside the cup?

891
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:32,600
Spoon...

892
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:33,930
What spoon?

893
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,430
You've been ranting about the spoon?

894
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,300
On the side, inside the cup... 
How does it matter?

895
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:38,300
Shut up?

896
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,350
Bloody sycophant.

897
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,680
Stupid sycophant.

898
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:49,720
Sorry for his stupid 
sycophant behaviour.

899
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,550
It's alright.

900
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,720
So sad.

901
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:54,970
As I was saying, Bali Singh 
will be really pleased to meet you.

902
01:22:55,640 --> 01:23:00,470
Once you two start to get along, 
you'll have nothing to worry about.

903
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,100
He handles everything... Yes...

904
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:04,930
I've had an old association with him.

905
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,510
And I want you to have 
a good rapport with him too.

906
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,640
"Love... Love... Love... "

907
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,300
"For me... For me... For me..."

908
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,050
"My love... love... love..."

909
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,930
"...for you... for you... for you..."

910
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:30,720
"You're the one..."

911
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,850
- "...that rules my heart." 
- I will call you back.

912
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:36,640
- So sweet. 
- "Your love's...has become my life."

913
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,510
"Your heart's all mine now."

914
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,640
- "There's nothing more I want." 
- Die.

915
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:00,930
I am here because 
I understand your pain.

916
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,550
I didn't understand.

917
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:06,970
He trained you in a way 
that you never understand.

918
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:12,720
Who's been scaring you till 
now with a leash around your neck?

919
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,010
You wanted to be a champion...

920
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,510
...but who was training you 
to be a loser.

921
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,640
Chulbul Pandey.

922
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:27,720
Your brother.

923
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:31,640
Can a brother do something like this?

924
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,970
Yes, he can.

925
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:39,640
A step-brother.

926
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:44,720
But now the leash 
will be around his neck.

927
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,390
How?

928
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,390
Because the entire 
game is about power.

929
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,510
If you join hands with me, 
then I'll give you that power.

930
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,220
Now think...

931
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:06,350
...would prefer to be my friend, 
and be powerful...

932
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:07,970
...or do you want to 
be your brother's lap dog...

933
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:13,720
And my enemy?

934
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,970
Happy birthday.

935
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:31,430
After the death of a student in a blast...

936
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:34,220
...in Tundla city of Uttar Pradesh, 
the people took to the streets.

937
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:37,390
Our correspondent had a word with 
SP Satyendra Singh of Tundla area.

938
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:42,850
Please...I just joined duty as the 
Police Superintendent of Tundla city.

939
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,720
The culprits responsible 
will be dealt with strictly...

940
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,010
Bada Chowraha Bus Depot.

941
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,890
...and the situation 
will be brought under control.

942
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:51,180
- That comes under your jurisdiction. 
- Soon the situation will be under controll

943
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:57,550
Son, we work to eat.

944
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:01,260
We can eat if we work.

945
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:06,930
No need to give me 
that look all the time.

946
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:09,300
I will keep my promise.

947
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,220
Look after the house.

948
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,850
There's tension in the city.

949
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:23,220
Give the phone to Ashok Singh.

950
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,430
He's been transferred.

951
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:25,510
Give the phone to Nadeem.

952
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,850
Sir, he's been transferred.

953
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:28,140
Who is there now?

954
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,350
Ravindra Yadav, sir.

955
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,470
Ranjan, sir.

956
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,680
Give him the phone.

957
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:34,430
Sir, he hasn't arrived yet.

958
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:35,890
- Who is it now? 
- Deepak sir.

959
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:36,970
Give him the phone.

960
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:38,760
Sir, Chulbul Pandey on the line.

961
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:40,470
He's out of his mind.

962
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,260
Tell him to go to hell.

963
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,550
I am not here.

964
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,300
Chulbul.

965
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,930
Don't worry.

966
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:54,600
These poor people fight among 
themselves like dogs and die.

967
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,680
Let them die. 
What is your problem?

968
01:26:56,930 --> 01:27:01,430
I was expecting something disgusting 
from a disgusting face like yours.

969
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:02,100
What?

970
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:08,300
You're lucky that I promised my wife 
that I won't resort to violence.

971
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,470
What?

972
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:12,890
Promised his wife.

973
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,300
No violence.

974
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,640
A husband's promised his wife...

975
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:28,430
...but not a Police officer.

976
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,390
We're public servants, rascal.

977
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:37,050
Our salaries come from 
taxes these people pay.

978
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,850
I joined the Police force 
to lower crime...

979
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,260
...not to encourage it.

980
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,360
Papa, you haven't returned yet. 
Where are you?

981
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:58,070
I am at the market. 
I'll be home soon.

982
01:27:58,150 --> 01:28:01,110
I've kept your food on the table. 
Come home soon.

983
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,360
Has Makkhi returned yet?

984
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:04,360
Makkhi's phone is 
switched off as well.

985
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:07,740
- Where is Chulbul? 
- I tried calling him...

986
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,570
Bittu.

987
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:13,400
Go to sleep.

988
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,450
You've school tomorrow.

989
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:28,450
Who is it?

990
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:30,610
No one.

991
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,240
Papa...

992
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:40,820
Uncle. It's paining a lot.

993
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,490
You will be fine, dear.

994
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,200
- Check his temperature. 
- Here you go, sir.

995
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:48,240
Okay.

996
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,900
I'll go check.

997
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:51,820
Mom...

998
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:55,570
Mom...

999
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:58,610
Mom...

1000
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:00,900
Mom...

1001
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,240
Hey...

1002
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,400
It's okay, Bittu. It's okay.

1003
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:09,320
Break down the door. 
Break it down.

1004
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,400
There she is.

1005
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:11,490
- She is getting away. 
- Catch her.

1006
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,150
- Where did she go? 
- Find her.

1007
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,530
The back door is open.

1008
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:23,530
She must have gone out this way.

1009
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,610
- Check. Hurry up. 
- Mom...

1010
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:26,820
- Run, Bittu. 
- Don't let her escape.

1011
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:27,700
No...

1012
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:28,650
- Mom... 
- That way.

1013
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,360
- Bittu, run. 
- Where did she go?

1014
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:31,530
Check here. Check...

1015
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,030
Where did she go?

1016
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:34,030
Look there.

1017
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:40,700
Mom...

1018
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:43,900
Bittu.

1019
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:46,700
Papa...

1020
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,400
Get up. Why are you crying?

1021
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:39,780
To me, They all seem 
from the same family.

1022
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,700
Imagine how romantic 
their parents must be.

1023
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,700
You should learn from them.

1024
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,150
Unbelievable, Rajjo.

1025
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,820
You're married to a cop.

1026
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:58,740
Should I keep your 
promise or do my duty?

1027
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:04,150
Don't say anything stupid.

1028
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,900
Otherwise, I'll get thrashed.

1029
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:11,070
Come on, Rajjo.

1030
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:17,820
I really love the way 
my name sounds with yours.

1031
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:21,700
Go ahead, perform your duty.

1032
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:23,280
Great.

1033
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,320
Go sit in the jeep...

1034
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:28,820
...and watch a different aspect 
of your fearless husband.

1035
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:38,400
I am not angry because 
you barged in my home.

1036
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:45,240
I am angry because you barged in 
when I wasn't around.

1037
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:56,530
Go.

1038
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:02,610
I may have forgiven you if you had 
brought a full chilled bottles instead.

1039
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,240
Sh**

1040
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:38,570
Nice to meet you.

1041
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,490
I am Chulbul Pandey.

1042
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,150
Your brother broke my home.

1043
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,570
I'll break your head.

1044
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:21,610
What?

1045
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,200
So?

1046
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,610
Bittu, come here.

1047
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,400
You wanted the door, didn't you?

1048
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:03,530
Are you happy?

1049
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:10,900
I promise I'll never 
say anything stupid again...

1050
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:12,740
That reminds me.

1051
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:26,280
I'll never tell you to make 
stupid sentimental promises again.

1052
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,150
Shall we make up?

1053
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:35,780
That's for kids.

1054
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:38,200
I want something else.

1055
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:02,740
"Draping your sari around..."

1056
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:06,820
"...covering your blouse."

1057
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:17,030
"Draping your sari around..."

1058
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,490
"...covering your blouse."

1059
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:24,280
"She stepped out with 
a lot of respect like this..."

1060
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:25,950
"Like this..."

1061
01:35:26,490 --> 01:35:27,610
"Like this..."

1062
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:31,240
"She stepped out 
with respect like this..."

1063
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,030
"Like this..."

1064
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,150
"Like this..."

1065
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:47,240
"My beloved's is very different..."

1066
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:54,650
"...even his anger 
makes me fall in love."

1067
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:01,360
"Your gaze aims straight for my heart."

1068
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:05,030
"And your beauty 
that steals my slumber."

1069
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:11,900
"Showing off belly button..."

1070
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:14,990
"...and hiding his face behind his hands."

1071
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:18,740
"She passed by coyly like this..."

1072
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,530
"Like this..."

1073
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:22,150
"Like this..."

1074
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,820
"She passed by coyly like this..."

1075
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,610
"Like this..."

1076
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,450
"Like this..."

1077
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:36,650
"Looks at me with a smile..."

1078
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:39,950
"...chewing gum all the while."

1079
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:43,700
"He talks to me like this..."

1080
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:45,320
"Like this..."

1081
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,400
"Like this..."

1082
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:03,310
Mr. Pandey.

1083
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:05,350
You cheated me.

1084
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:06,980
Cheat?

1085
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:11,440
You're neither Robin Hood 
or Chulbul Pandey.

1086
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,560
Then who am I?

1087
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:17,520
You are Karu Pandey.

1088
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,900
Karu Pandey.

1089
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,150
Karu Pandey.

1090
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,480
Surya.

1091
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:44,400
Tell Baali sir I said thank you.

1092
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:46,600
He's made my dream come true.

1093
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:49,350
I'll make his dreams a reality too.

1094
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,650
Jai Hind, sir.

1095
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:56,560
Relax.

1096
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:58,940
And I'll prove my worth to him.

1097
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:00,100
Makkhi.

1098
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:05,020
Are you going to a fancy dress 
competition wearing dressed as ASP?

1099
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:09,020
Hello...no more Makkhi.

1100
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:13,020
Call him ASP 
Makkhan Chand Prajapati Pandey.

1101
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:15,650
Now he's at the same level as you.

1102
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:17,690
He'll handle the 
proceedings in here...

1103
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:19,770
...and you'll handle fieldwork.

1104
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:20,730
Understand.

1105
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:25,350
And listen, 
don't try to be over smart.

1106
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,100
Understand.

1107
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:28,310
Head home, 
enjoy your wife's cooking...

1108
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,350
...and exercise.

1109
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:32,560
Go on.

1110
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:06,850
I know you want to bury me alive.

1111
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,730
But now you know how 
humiliating it feels...

1112
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:15,060
...when you get slapped in public.

1113
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:14,810
You should've done this earlier.

1114
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:17,980
You'll make it really big someday.

1115
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,100
There's no place for you in this house 
or in my heart.

1116
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,400
Get out.

1117
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:48,520
Your new home and a new 
Brother is waiting for you.

1118
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:49,400
Come sit.

1119
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:06,900
Hello.

1120
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:34,150
She survived.

1121
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,770
Not even a scratch.

1122
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,900
She's sleeping soundly.

1123
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:51,060
Imagine she finds out that 
her life's headed for chaos...

1124
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:53,480
...could she sleep so peacefully?

1125
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:55,600
Baali Singh, 
if anything happens to my family...

1126
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:59,900
If something happens to my family, 
Then you won't spare me, etcetera...etcetera.

1127
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,650
But what's the point, Chulbul?

1128
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,400
Your family would be dead by then.

1129
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:14,730
There are two types of enmity, 
Chulbul.

1130
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:20,480
Professional and Personal.

1131
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:22,770
And Personal enmity...

1132
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:27,060
...is always fatal for the loved ones.

1133
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:32,850
You've personal experience, 
and even about the pain.

1134
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:45,230
Outlaw Cop Robin Hood Chulbul 
Pandey has nothing to say?

1135
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,060
No dialogue, or counter.

1136
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,810
Neither can he beg, wail...

1137
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,940
...or show attitude.

1138
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:56,940
He can only wait...

1139
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:02,270
...and watch his family die.

1140
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:20,270
One strong advice before I leave...

1141
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:24,150
You must have heard that 
in the battle of good vs evil...

1142
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:26,190
...good always wins.

1143
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:30,400
You heard it wrong.

1144
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:34,900
Evil wins.

1145
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:44,350
Because the good man can never 
stoop as low as evil.

1146
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:04,150
What kind of a list is this? 
Read it yourself.

1147
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:06,110
I won the elections last time.

1148
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,820
But this time my name's been removed...

1149
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:09,490
...and Baali Singh's name 
has been included instead.

1150
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:10,900
- He's a criminal. 
- Sit down.

1151
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:13,860
Look here, Baali Singh doesn't 
have a single charge against him.

1152
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,610
He has a clean record.

1153
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,650
Currently, he's a respectable citizen.

1154
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:21,030
No, he's not. He's a gangster.

1155
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:23,650
Mr. Chandan, 
your anger is unjustified.

1156
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,650
- We'll discuss this. 
- I don't want to discuss.

1157
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:26,990
We'll discuss this later.

1158
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,280
- Let's enjoy now. 
- No, sir.

1159
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,280
Let's go to the party. Come on. 
I'll go with you. Come.

1160
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,400
- You know my family reputation. 
- Don't worry, I'll fix everything.

1161
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:35,240
I want this list altered tomorrow.

1162
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,150
This...

1163
01:44:38,110 --> 01:44:38,950
Mr. Sharma.

1164
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:40,780
Mr. Sharma.

1165
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,820
Mr. Sharma.

1166
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:44,860
Mr. Sharma.

1167
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,650
Who's there?

1168
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:56,070
Baali Singh.

1169
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:17,820
He's getting what he deserves.

1170
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:19,860
He's blossomed into a flower.

1171
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:27,740
It's time to know why the seven 
of you were transferred here.

1172
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:32,740
A truck loaded with money for the elections 
will leave from Bhopal tomorrow.

1173
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,950
After it enters our area...

1174
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:40,650
...it will first pass-through 
Chitraipur Police Station.

1175
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:41,740
Sir.

1176
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:43,950
Then Devkheda.

1177
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:44,650
Sir.

1178
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:46,200
- Then Dadoli. 
- Sir.

1179
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:47,860
Dhirpur.

1180
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:49,110
Anantpur.

1181
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:50,990
Then Amavara.

1182
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,150
And then straight to my hideout.

1183
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,490
That truck...

1184
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,780
...will enter our area tomorrow.

1185
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:12,900
Mom, Khushi...Khushi's uncle.

1186
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,610
Now me.

1187
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,610
Who's next?

1188
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:18,900
Bittu?

1189
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:20,450
Papa?

1190
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:21,990
You?

1191
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:32,700
You two are the most important people 
in my life.

1192
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:36,110
I'll take a transfer from here.

1193
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,240
No...

1194
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:41,650
I said I won't force you 
to make any more stupid promises.

1195
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:46,110
Baali Singh needs to be stopped.

1196
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:52,860
You must end his chapter now.

1197
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:58,530
Now you have Spoken like 
Mrs. Chulbul Pandey.

1198
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:03,240
These rascals have forced me 
to show my despicable side.

1199
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:10,860
Now wait and watch how your husband 
Karu Pandey screws with them.

1200
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,400
F**k him b*****

1201
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,280
Dangerous.

1202
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,360
I will.

1203
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,150
I will.

1204
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:30,200
Since you're not well, 
here's a long distance...

1205
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,990
This is fun.

1206
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,360
Feeling light.

1207
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:02,400
Here comes the truck.

1208
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:03,740
Shambu, open the gate.

1209
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:07,280
Stop.

1210
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:12,070
Suraj. This is Deepak speaking 
from Chitraipur Police Station.

1211
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:14,900
The truck which had to deliver money 
has been hijacked by someone.

1212
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:21,400
Be prepared.

1213
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:26,280
We've set up a barricade 
and waiting for the truck to arrive.

1214
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:33,360
"Beloved's eyes..."

1215
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:35,900
Mr. Pandey, I am waiting.

1216
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:38,740
Coming.

1217
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:49,150
Chulbul.

1218
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:51,150
Such corrupt people.

1219
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:55,240
There are 70 million 
rupees in this truck.

1220
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:58,950
I'll give you a one-time offer.

1221
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,950
For life-long.

1222
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:08,860
This isn't like life insurance which will 
be given to your family after you die.

1223
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:14,570
Its an insurance which you can 
cash-in this offer right now.

1224
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,280
But on one condition...

1225
01:50:20,610 --> 01:50:24,450
You must cut all ties 
with that rascal Baali Singh.

1226
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,740
Loyalty means everything to me.

1227
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:40,780
If you work with me, 
then you'll get an equal post...

1228
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:43,610
...equal respect, and equal opportunity.

1229
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:47,820
Let's see whether you 
guys are enterprising or fools.

1230
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:38,950
"Mr. Pandey's so lost in love, 
he's gone crazy."

1231
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,700
"...gone crazy."

1232
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:42,150
"...gone crazy."

1233
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,990
"You wanted UP, sweetheart..."

1234
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:46,070
"...but I brought the universe 
at your feet."

1235
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:49,860
"Mr. Pandey standing right here 
with his goggles..."

1236
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:53,780
"...chewing his favourite betel leaf."

1237
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:56,530
"Bravo..."

1238
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,990
"The entire city and all the people 
watch in awe."

1239
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:04,740
"Someone ward off 
the evil eye from him..."

1240
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:08,570
"Mr. Pandey standing here..."

1241
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:09,860
"Listen to this..."

1242
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:28,700
"I was innocent, so said, everyone."

1243
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:32,450
"But you spoiled me, sweetheart."

1244
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:33,820
"Sweetheart..."

1245
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:40,070
"I was innocent, so said, everyone."

1246
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:43,780
"But you spoiled me, sweetheart."

1247
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:48,950
"Swirled moustache, 
and deodorant on my..."

1248
01:52:49,030 --> 01:52:53,110
"Goggles on my face, 
and gel in my hair..."

1249
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:58,860
"...everything I did was 
for you, beloved."

1250
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:03,360
"Munna's got infamous..."

1251
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:09,950
"Munna's got infamous, 
darling for your sake."

1252
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:13,610
"Munna's got infamous, 
darling for your sake."

1253
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,610
"Munna's got infamous..."

1254
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:16,900
Nasty...

1255
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:20,860
"They say..."

1256
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:22,950
"Goggles hanging by the collar..."

1257
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:24,780
"...curling my moustache..."

1258
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:28,240
"...I've been chasing after 
you with gel in my hair."

1259
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:31,990
"I've been following 
you everywhere you go..."

1260
01:53:32,070 --> 01:53:35,740
"...and smacked so many for your sake."

1261
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:39,450
"The children in your lane remember 
my bike's number plate..."

1262
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:43,200
"...my family thinks 
their boy's lost his way."

1263
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,860
"Body like a model and yet 
works as a cop."

1264
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:50,700
"...works as a cop."

1265
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:54,400
"He's breaks bones, 
but more interested in singing."

1266
01:53:54,490 --> 01:53:58,360
"...interested in singing."

1267
01:53:58,450 --> 01:54:02,030
"People talk about me all the time, 
from morning to night."

1268
01:54:02,110 --> 01:54:03,950
"It's hard to control one's heart..."

1269
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:05,780
"...when you're around."

1270
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:10,740
"I feel drawn towards you, 
such is your attraction."

1271
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,570
"The song got rewinded..."

1272
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:24,450
"Munna's got infamous, 
darling for your sake."

1273
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:28,030
"Munna's got infamous, 
darling for your sake."

1274
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:29,860
"Munna's got infamous..."

1275
01:54:29,950 --> 01:54:31,610
"Mogambo's...delighted."

1276
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:05,400
"Too many casualties... 
darling for your sake."

1277
01:55:05,490 --> 01:55:09,070
"Munna's got infamous, 
darling for your sake."

1278
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:12,740
"Too many casualties... 
darling for your sake."

1279
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:16,570
"My heart's... 
darling for your sake."

1280
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:24,200
"Salman Khan... 
darling for your sake."

1281
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:31,570
9445437216.

1282
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:33,900
Salman Khan?

1283
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,860
Drop Munni home.

1284
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:40,360
Not like this.

1285
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:42,320
With your eyes.

1286
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:43,650
With your eyes.

1287
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:56,860
What a dance, sir... 
Amazing.

1288
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:58,860
Brother, smile.

1289
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:05,740
Hello.

1290
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:28,530
I just have to take this picture.

1291
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:30,240
I've grown old.

1292
01:56:34,610 --> 01:56:35,610
Hello.

1293
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,280
Baali.

1294
01:56:40,150 --> 01:56:42,780
All Your inspectors are in my custody.

1295
01:56:43,150 --> 01:56:46,900
You have my 50 million 
and I have 14 of your men.

1296
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:58,360
Deliver to me 
by tomorrow morning.

1297
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:02,360
Otherwise, 
you will start losing men one by one.

1298
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:04,030
And you will be responsible for that.

1299
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:09,240
Don't be late, Chulbul.

1300
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:16,400
Baali Singh's raised 
my blood pressure as well.

1301
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:24,320
Sir...

1302
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:26,740
We must head to the bungalow 
for the Durga Puja festivities.

1303
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:34,530
- Hello. 
- Daboo...

1304
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:35,490
Speaking...

1305
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:38,570
Tell the Minister that everything's 
going according to plan...

1306
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:39,610
...and he shouldn't give any statement.

1307
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:41,610
The money for the elections 
are coming back.

1308
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:43,610
And especially stay away from Chulbul.

1309
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:45,740
It's an important message. 
Don't forget to tell him.

1310
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:47,150
Yes, got it.

1311
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:48,490
Daboo.

1312
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:51,570
See you, sir. Goodbye.

1313
01:57:51,650 --> 01:57:52,490
Yes...

1314
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:55,860
Why didn't you tell me he was 
to meet me yesterday?

1315
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:14,650
- Brother-in-law... 
- Tell me about the phone calls today.

1316
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:16,570
He's so forgetful.

1317
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:18,740
The first call was at 9:40 am.

1318
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:20,400
We've to pay 1155 rupees.

1319
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:21,570
For the cable connection.

1320
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:23,070
You can do that yourself.

1321
01:58:26,530 --> 01:58:27,150
Next...

1322
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:30,990
If he wasn't my wife's brother...

1323
01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:31,990
Done.

1324
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:36,030
Brother-in-law, 
your orders are my command.

1325
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,820
Very good.

1326
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,070
Next...

1327
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:43,150
- Makkhan Chand Pandey called. 
- Bring the Minister out.

1328
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:44,200
Where did that stone come from?

1329
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:45,320
Who is throwing stones from outside?

1330
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:48,570
- Check who's throwing stones. 
- Forget them.

1331
01:58:48,650 --> 01:58:49,400
Go.

1332
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:50,570
Makkhan Chand Pandey...

1333
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:52,070
Enough about Makkhan Chand.

1334
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:53,240
My life's in danger.

1335
01:58:54,650 --> 01:58:55,450
Who is it?

1336
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:56,240
Stop it.

1337
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,280
- Brother-in-law... 
- Stop hurling stones.

1338
01:58:58,360 --> 01:58:59,780
Whose the bloody idiot?

1339
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:03,530
- Do you remember anything now? 
- No.

1340
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:04,780
Then keep shouting.

1341
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:07,030
Bring the Minister out.

1342
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:10,990
Bring the Minister out.

1343
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:13,240
Call the Police. Call the Police.

1344
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:16,990
- This is exactly why Makkhan Chand... 
- What Makkhan...

1345
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:23,530
Chulbul.

1346
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,820
Chulbul. 
You'll have a long life.

1347
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:28,070
Look what these people are doing. 
Take a look outside.

1348
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:29,900
I'll take a look outside.

1349
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:32,740
Don't leave me alone.

1350
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:35,990
Sir. Sit here and relax.

1351
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:38,860
And I'll solve this problem with love.

1352
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:39,610
No...

1353
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:40,740
Later. Later.

1354
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:43,450
First, get me out 
of this situation, please.

1355
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,030
In that case...

1356
01:59:48,150 --> 01:59:49,650
Let's go.

1357
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:52,450
The government vehicle's 
parked outside.

1358
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:53,200
Come on.

1359
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:55,280
Now tell me what you wanted to say. 
Say it.

1360
01:59:55,490 --> 01:59:57,150
Makkhan Chand Pandey called.

1361
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:59,150
Everything is going according to plan.

1362
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:01,740
Don't give any statement to anyone. 
No meetings at all.

1363
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:04,740
And especially stay away from Chulbul.

1364
02:00:15,450 --> 02:00:16,950
- Chulbul here, sir. 
- Yes, Chulbul?

1365
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:18,740
The Minister's been kidnapped.

1366
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:20,700
What? 
The Minister's been kidnapped.

1367
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:26,360
- Vishambar speaking. 
- Tell me.

1368
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:28,450
Tell me what I just said.

1369
02:00:28,610 --> 02:00:29,860
But you haven't said anything.

1370
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:32,780
That means you're hearing me.

1371
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:35,070
Tell me what is it.

1372
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,900
I've sent you a text message.

1373
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,320
Check it.

1374
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:44,740
Did you check it, sir?

1375
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:47,200
I was about to, but you called again.

1376
02:00:47,950 --> 02:00:49,820
So sorry, but doesn't matter.

1377
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:52,240
Sir...I've WhatsApped you

1378
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:53,780
More secure.

1379
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:54,900
Please check.

1380
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:55,860
Okay.

1381
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:00,200
Did you check it, sir?

1382
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:03,740
Stop this insanity or else 
I will kill you. Understand.

1383
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:05,650
Tell me what is the matter?

1384
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:11,900
We're having a secret meeting.

1385
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,110
No one should find out.

1386
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:16,700
Sir...

1387
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:22,700
Chulbul has kidnapped the Minister.

1388
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:24,740
They are scheming against you.

1389
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:25,860
Be careful.

1390
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:26,820
Over and out.

1391
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,110
Who is it?

1392
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:36,110
Who is it?

1393
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:00,110
Stop pushing. 
Where are your manners?

1394
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,700
There's a saying...

1395
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:04,360
- No pain, no gain. 
- Yes, sir.

1396
02:02:04,530 --> 02:02:07,240
That was a sound thrashing, 
public servants.

1397
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:07,990
Yes, sir.

1398
02:02:08,070 --> 02:02:09,530
I am going to take a selfie.

1399
02:02:09,610 --> 02:02:11,150
Are you going to cry or smile?

1400
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,530
Smile, sir.

1401
02:02:12,610 --> 02:02:13,610
Then smile.

1402
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:47,110
Let us through.

1403
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:06,110
Mr. Baali Singh.

1404
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:08,400
We're from Crime Branch.

1405
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:10,030
We want to search your home.

1406
02:03:10,530 --> 02:03:12,780
We have a search order.

1407
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:16,320
We found out that you've hidden 
your crimes in your own home.

1408
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,280
And we also have evidence.

1409
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,700
We have court orders.

1410
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:27,450
Hurry up. Hurry up. 
Dig deeper.

1411
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:31,240
Nothing here, sir.

1412
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:32,740
We didn't find anything, sir.

1413
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:33,990
Nothing here, sir.

1414
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:35,400
Nothing here, sir.

1415
02:03:35,490 --> 02:03:38,280
- We didn't find anything, sir. 
- Nothing here, sir.

1416
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:41,570
We didn't find anything, sir.

1417
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:43,610
We didn't find a single dead body, sir.

1418
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:45,530
The information is incorrect, sir.

1419
02:03:45,610 --> 02:03:48,650
(Chanting)

1420
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:51,700
(Chanting)

1421
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:54,820
(Chanting)

1422
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:57,740
(Chanting)

1423
02:03:57,820 --> 02:04:00,860
(Chanting)

1424
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:03,900
(Chanting)

1425
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:06,400
(Chanting)

1426
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,990
I wonder what he's planning to do.

1427
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:11,280
What has he got us into?

1428
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,030
God knows what's going on in his mind.

1429
02:04:13,110 --> 02:04:14,070
Who knows?

1430
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:16,990
We saved the Police officers, sir...

1431
02:04:17,070 --> 02:04:19,740
...unfortunately 
we couldn't save the Minister.

1432
02:04:21,990 --> 02:04:24,450
According to our sources, 
we've learned that...

1433
02:04:24,530 --> 02:04:26,700
...Baali Singh wanted 
to kill the Minister.

1434
02:04:29,490 --> 02:04:30,530
Yes, sir.

1435
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:33,820
What nonsense is this?

1436
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,320
What are you saying?

1437
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:38,070
I'll die later from you bullet, 
I'll die of blood pressure first.

1438
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:41,400
How can Baali Singh kill me 
when I'm with you?

1439
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:01,780
Go on.

1440
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,860
I'll tell you about 
Baali Singh's crimes.

1441
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:09,780
I'll have to if I want to stay alive.

1442
02:05:35,150 --> 02:05:36,110
Ready?

1443
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,240
Action!

1444
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:45,150
Baali Singh is a dangerous criminal.

1445
02:05:47,070 --> 02:05:52,900
He supplies girls to 
influential people of society.

1446
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:55,700
And even to me.

1447
02:05:58,700 --> 02:06:03,900
I am equally involved in 
Baali Singh's illegal businesses.

1448
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:08,110
He even has an illegal 
mining business.

1449
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:11,200
He sends his goons to help me.

1450
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:13,070
During the elections...

1451
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:15,740
He has committed numerous murders.

1452
02:06:16,610 --> 02:06:20,530
He shot many people 
dead in front of me.

1453
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:28,450
He buries people alive 
and builds orchards over them.

1454
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:30,860
He claims that he owns the Law...

1455
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:34,110
...and the government's his puppet.

1456
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:35,700
I know this place.

1457
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:38,280
Its where brother hangs out.

1458
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:49,250
Baali... My friend!

1459
02:06:49,330 --> 02:06:50,500
Save me.

1460
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:54,700
That rascal Chulbul Pandey made 
me confess against you at gunpoint.

1461
02:06:54,790 --> 02:06:56,000
But don't worry...

1462
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:02,950
Brother-in-law.

1463
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:22,910
Baali Singh...just a minute.

1464
02:08:17,330 --> 02:08:18,450
Ram.

1465
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:31,410
- Come on. 
- Where are you taking me?

1466
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:33,910
Come on.

1467
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:35,700
Sit quietly.

1468
02:08:35,790 --> 02:08:37,000
- Don't make a sound. 
- Bittu.

1469
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:38,200
- Papa... 
- Mom.

1470
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:39,370
Grandpa...

1471
02:08:39,910 --> 02:08:41,000
Mom...

1472
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:42,370
Mom...

1473
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:43,450
Chulbul.

1474
02:08:43,950 --> 02:08:46,370
I know where they took her, father.

1475
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:49,120
You cook dinner tonight.

1476
02:08:49,450 --> 02:08:51,200
We're all going to eat together.

1477
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:24,160
Mr. Pandey's here.

1478
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:26,790
With his goggles.

1479
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:30,950
Aren't you going to welcome him?

1480
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:35,290
How do they find such 
places for their grave

1481
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:38,580
Even Vasco Da Gama couldn't 
have found this place.

1482
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
You must have heard a saying...

1483
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:44,620
"Finally you met your match."

1484
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:49,040
If you love proverbs so much, 
then you must have heard...

1485
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:58,370
...when bad luck's smiling on you, 
you get bitten by a Chihuahua.

1486
02:09:59,910 --> 02:10:02,500
The small one...I like it.

1487
02:10:03,870 --> 02:10:07,290
By the way, Mr. Pandey. 
How is your far-sightedness?

1488
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,160
Take a look.

1489
02:10:27,330 --> 02:10:29,500
Now you've made me angry.

1490
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:31,830
Tell me something...

1491
02:10:32,370 --> 02:10:35,750
Why do you rascals, 
like Chhedi, Baccha, and now you...

1492
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:38,620
...why do you all have 
one thing in common?

1493
02:10:38,950 --> 02:10:41,290
Every time, in the end, 
you guys take my wife hostage.

1494
02:10:41,370 --> 02:10:42,910
And now you've hung her.

1495
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:48,790
You see I've been hearing since childhood 
that you'll be hanged, you'll be hanged...

1496
02:10:48,870 --> 02:10:51,500
...but no one's ever done anything.

1497
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,580
What the...

1498
02:10:55,120 --> 02:10:58,580
You should appreciate me, 
Pandey, that I did.

1499
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:09,200
You brothers had a nice plan going.

1500
02:11:09,950 --> 02:11:13,620
But your brother made a small mistake, 
Mr. Pandey.

1501
02:11:40,330 --> 02:11:42,330
For my information, I want to know...

1502
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:45,250
...who are you going to save first?

1503
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:46,910
You must have heard...

1504
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:50,620
...saviour is always 
greater than the killer.

1505
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:55,540
Meaning...I am both.

1506
02:11:56,040 --> 02:12:00,700
Meaning...I'm going to kill you, 
and save them.

1507
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:04,950
But you won't see it.

1508
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:07,250
Your spirit will...

1509
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:10,160
...and won't be able 
to do sh** about it.

1510
02:12:10,410 --> 02:12:14,040
Don't put away your 
tasks for tomorrow.

1511
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:16,910
Now...

1512
02:12:17,250 --> 02:12:18,750
You're talking about the present.

1513
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:20,790
But I've already done it in the past.

1514
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:22,450
Meaning last night.

1515
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:26,790
Why do you think, I am standing 
here with my feet on this mango crate...

1516
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:30,000
...while my wife and 
brother hang in midair.

1517
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,660
You think I am showing off.

1518
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:35,160
Idiot!

1519
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:37,910
Let me show you...

1520
02:12:40,410 --> 02:12:41,750
How I am going to

1521
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:45,200
s**** you.

1522
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:50,410
I killed Khushi because of you.

1523
02:15:54,790 --> 02:15:57,040
I've been living all alone!

1524
02:15:57,790 --> 02:16:01,250
But you got married 
and even had a kid.

1525
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:03,450
A kid.

1526
02:16:06,290 --> 02:16:08,910
You call this love.

1527
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:35,540
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

1528
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:38,040
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

1529
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:40,580
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

1530
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:43,120
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

1531
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:45,830
"Chulbul the Fearless one..."

1532
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:02,160
You were absolutely right.

1533
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:05,040
Evil always wins.

1534
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:12,830
Because for you no one's as bad as me.

1535
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:18,870
If you love someone...

1536
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:22,910
...and she doesn't love you back...

1537
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:26,200
...then you'll rape her...

1538
02:19:28,330 --> 02:19:30,200
Throw acid on her face...

1539
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:32,580
Burn her...

1540
02:19:33,790 --> 02:19:36,160
Kill her...

1541
02:19:36,370 --> 02:19:39,910
I never raped anyone, but...

1542
02:19:40,830 --> 02:19:47,200
...I'll kill, burn and even throw acid.

1543
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:48,660
And now...

1544
02:19:58,750 --> 02:20:00,500
I'll even rape!

1545
02:20:03,330 --> 02:20:05,290
I'll even rape!

1546
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:54,370
You took Khushi from me.

1547
02:20:56,910 --> 02:21:05,660
Impotents like you don't 
belong on earth but under it.

1548
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:26,040
(Chanting)

1549
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:29,120
(Chanting)

1550
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:38,200
(Chanting)

1551
02:21:38,290 --> 02:21:41,290
(Chanting)

1552
02:21:41,370 --> 02:21:44,370
(Chanting)

1553
02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:47,410
(Chanting)

1554
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:50,450
(Chanting)

1555
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:52,830
(Chanting)

1556
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:09,330
Can you hear me?

1557
02:22:12,950 --> 02:22:14,950
Before you go, hear one last thing.

1558
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:17,580
As you sow, so shall you reap.

1559
02:22:19,330 --> 02:22:21,750
What goes around, comes around.

1560
02:22:23,290 --> 02:22:25,790
You had the habit of provoking others...

1561
02:22:25,870 --> 02:22:28,660
- That's why... 
- Mr. Pandey. Will you just keeping speaking?

1562
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:30,620
Save us soon.

1563
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,370
Why were you scared?

1564
02:22:38,290 --> 02:22:41,580
When God's my benefactor...

1565
02:22:41,660 --> 02:22:45,620
...no one can lay a finger on me, 
whether Baali or Bahubali.

1566
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:47,910
Tell me something?

1567
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:49,750
How am I looking from up there?

1568
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:50,950
Fantastic?

1569
02:23:04,250 --> 02:23:06,330
Mom, who is she?

1570
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:10,000
She was my friend, Khushi. 
She was like a sister to me.

1571
02:23:10,910 --> 02:23:13,330
And if she was around, 
then I wouldn't be.

1572
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:15,830
And if I wasn't around, 
then neither would you.

1573
02:23:15,950 --> 02:23:17,790
You would be there.

1574
02:23:18,250 --> 02:23:19,870
And who is he?

1575
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:22,450
He's your father's father.

1576
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:25,290
If he was around, 
then your grandfather wouldn't be.

1577
02:23:25,370 --> 02:23:27,120
And neither would I.

1578
02:23:28,450 --> 02:23:30,200
Don't rack your brains.

1579
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:32,160
You'll understand when you grow up.

1580
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:35,540
It's very complicated... 
Pandey's family.

1581
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:41,540
Now tell me...what was 
that dialogue you used to say.

1582
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:45,830
I am not afraid of getting slapped, 
but love scares me.

1583
02:23:45,910 --> 02:23:47,870
And who did you steal it from?

1584
02:23:48,910 --> 02:23:49,950
Quiet.

1585
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:52,660
My great-grandma used to say it. 
Khushi used to say it as well.

1586
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:57,370
But now I am afraid of both, 
getting slapped and love.

1587
02:23:57,870 --> 02:23:59,500
Why are you scared?

1588
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:04,250
Have no fear, 
when Karu Pandey is here.

1589
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:08,700
Papa...Aasma called.

1590
02:24:10,250 --> 02:24:12,790
She was saying that she got married.

1591
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:17,410
Don't worry, father.

1592
02:24:17,500 --> 02:24:19,330
We'll find someone else for you.

1593
02:24:19,870 --> 02:24:21,540
Brother...

1594
02:24:24,370 --> 02:24:26,620
I guess he got his memory back.

1595
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:30,910
At last, I remember everything.

1596
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,290
Look...

1597
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:37,750
Chedi Singh... 
and this is Baccha Singh's money.

1598
02:24:44,660 --> 02:24:46,660
500 and 1000 rupee notes.

1599
02:24:46,910 --> 02:24:48,000
So...what?

1600
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,790
After demonetisation?

1601
02:24:53,790 --> 02:24:55,660
What will I do with this money?

1602
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:58,250
What will you do now, Chulbul?

1603
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,290
With your permission, papa...

1604
02:25:02,370 --> 02:25:04,830
...I am thinking of quitting 
the Police Force...

1605
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:06,660
...and join Politics.

1606
02:25:06,910 --> 02:25:07,750
Huh?

1607
02:25:11,830 --> 02:25:12,790
Why?

1608
02:25:13,330 --> 02:25:14,250
No?

1609
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:15,830
Think about it.

1610
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:17,580
I will too.

1611
02:25:17,660 --> 02:25:18,250
Goodbye.
