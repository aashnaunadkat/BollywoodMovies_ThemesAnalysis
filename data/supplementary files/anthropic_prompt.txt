You will be given a set of txt files. Each file is named using the IMDb ID of a movie (e.g., tt1234567.pdf) and contains the following information:
1. imdb_id of the movie as imd_id: {imdb_id}
2. the synopsis of that movie
3. subtitles for that movie (this field will be demarcated as SUBTITLES. it may be missing for some movies) 

Your task is to analyze the file to identify whether the movie explores any of the following sociopolitical themes:
- Hindu-Muslim relations
- Gender relations
- Nationalism

Each movie may explore more than one theme. For each theme that is identified, assess the movie’s messaging using four analytical axes:

- Inclusive vs Exclusionary
- Positive vs Negative
- Progressive vs Conservative
- Escapist vs Confrontational

If a theme is not explored in a movie, code the theme as 0 and set all 4 sentiment axes to N/A.

Instructions:
If the file contains fewer than 500 characters, return "Not enough information" in the failure_log column, and set all coded variables to 0 or N/A as required.

The imdb_id must match the imdb ID given in the file at the top exactly.

Include only one row per file in the output.

Output the result as a single row CSV with headers.
