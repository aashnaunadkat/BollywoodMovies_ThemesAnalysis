A tennis player incurs his pushy divorced parents' displeasure when he pretends to fall for a struggling model.

[Wikipedia Plot Synopsis]
Chirag comes from a wealthy background and assists his father, Siddharth Mehra, in managing and maintaining their land. Chirag's parents have been divorced due to incompatibility arising mainly due to his businesswoman mother, Shalini's hatred of tennis, a sport that Chirag wants to play professionally.
Shalini and Siddharth would like to see Chirag married, and accordingly, Shalini picks London-based Kamiah, while Siddharth picks Bathinda-based Manjeet Ahluwalia. Chirag, who sneaks off to practice tennis at night, is asked to make a choice but informs them that he is in love with a model named Anishka. The displeased couple decides to confront and put pressure on a struggling and unknowing klutz-like Anishka to leave their son alone, but they fail.
In the end, Chirag's parents realize their mistake and together attend Chirag's tennis match and give blessings to Chirag and Anishka.
