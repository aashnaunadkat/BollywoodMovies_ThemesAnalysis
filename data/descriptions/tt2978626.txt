The film begins with Akhil Lokhande getting paid for an advertisement, but a fight ensues when he is not given the full amount he was promised. This pattern of underpayment and resulting fights continues through several other assignments. Each fight ends when Akhil receives a phone call, prompting him to leave. He then arrives on a shoot where Saakshi is filming her television series. After her shoot, they go for a walk in the park, observing other couples. At the end of their walk, Akhil proposes to Saakshi. 
Akhil and Saakshi visit her father's house, where her father insists that Akhil must become rich before he can marry Saakshi. Determined, Akhil visits his film-obsessed friend Jugnu's shop and informs him that he is going to visit his father in the hospital due to chest pain. However, Akhil's father, Mr Lokhande, is actually faking his illness and enjoying the hospital's luxury services. Akhil arrives just in time to witness this and goes to confront Mr Lokhande, who reveals that Akhil is adopted. He explains that Akhil's real father was not ready for a child, so Akhil's mother left, only to be killed in a train crash. Akhil survived, and Mr Lokhande adopted him to claim compensation from the railway officers. 
In a fit of rage, Akhil beats up Mr Lokhande. Back at his house, Akhil opens a chest containing love letters from his real father to his mother, along with a locket with their pictures.
