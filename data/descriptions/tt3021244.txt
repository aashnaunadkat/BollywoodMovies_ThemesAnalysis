[Wikipedia Plot Synopsis]
The plot revolves around Neha Malini (Soha), who is a non-resident Indian returning to India in order to start a school in a village in north Bihar. Starting off optimistic and happy about her endeavor, she is unaware of the hardships, obstructions, and risks awaiting her in this small, serene village.
She is pleased after meeting three boys, Awadhesh, Hari and Gorakh but soon finds out that it is the beginning of a nightmare. Being hardcore criminals, these three boys become the center of her activities. After seeing this, she vows to stop the criminal and sexual exploitation of the children in the village.
