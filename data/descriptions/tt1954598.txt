Dimple Chaddha (Parineeti Chopra) is a spoiled brat and the only daughter of Sandeep Chaddha, the creator of "Chaddha Industries", a huge finance company in Delhi. Her boyfriend, Sunny Singh (Ranveer Singh), convinces her father that he really loves her. The next day, he breaks into an old bungalow and throws stones at it, harassing the residents. He explains his actions to Dimple: The bungalow he vandalized actually belongs to his father, who died recently, and it had been illegally encroached upon by the tenants. He has to pay thousands in taxes, lest he is arrested.Dimple convinces her father to help Sunny gets his ancestral property back, to which Sandeep agrees. Unbeknownst to Sandeep, the family living there had a stay order and had a family dispute in the court for years, and there was no "Sunny Singh" involved, which meant that Sunny had conned Dimple. Dimple becomes heartbroken and tries tracing Sunny, who, in the meanwhile, is boarding a flight to Mumbai, with the money he received by conning Dimple's father.Flash forward to today: In Mumbai, Ricky is working as a janitor. There, he spies on Raina Parulekar (Dipannita Sharma), who is a headstrong, can do businesswoman in a big PR firm called Synergy Services. She has been ordered by her boss to obtain an M.F. Hussain painting which is sold out everywhere. Ricky attracts Raina's attention by a planned "chance" meeting, where he, pretending to be an art aficionado named "Deven Shah", tells her that he has been loaned that same painting for an art exhibition by a reputed businessman (Mr. Suri). Raina, desperate to deliver on her promise, fails to identify the fake painting and falls into the trap laid by Deven.To buy the painting, she is made to deal with the owner of the painting, Mr. Suri, over the phone, as he is not available to meet at such short notice. Mr. Suri (who is actually Ricky, using a voice encryption software), after much deliberation, agrees to sell the painting for 90 Lakh rupees, which he tells Raina to handover to the "honest and innocent Deven". She hands over Rs. 60 Lakhs to Deven as advance. At the grand party, the real "Mr. Suri" contacts Raina's boss and reprimands him over the phone for using his name in a transaction which never happened.Humiliated, Raina's boss immediately fires Raina for her ignorant mistake, accusing her of trying to con the company for Rs.60 Lakhs. Humiliated, Raina reveals to the media about Deven Shah, who has duped her for a fake Hussain painting. Dimple sees the news on TV and suspects that Deven Shah could be "Sunny". She contacts Raina, who instantly recognizes that Sunny Singh is indeed Deven Shah. Simultaneously, Raina receives another call from Lucknow from a widow named Saira Rashid (Aditi Sharma), who explains her story of having been conned, for an amount of Rs 10 Lakh, by a man named Iqbal Khan.Raina asks Dimple and Saira to come to Mumbai so that they can make a plan to find and con their common conman, who they simply name "Bloody Kameena (BK)" (Bloody Scoundrel). To trace BK, Raina uses the help of one of her hacker friends, who sorts all prepaid numbers from around India which also have the same unique "caller tune" (the famous dialogue by Shah Rukh Khan from "Baazigar"). They finally manage to identify his number and trace him to Goa, where he goes by the alias of "Diego Vaz".To set the plan in motion, Raina decides to hire an acquaintance. Enter Ishika (Anushka Sharma): a really smart, sweet-talking and cunning saleswoman, who'd act as the daughter of an NRI American business tycoon, who wishes to open a restaurant in India and prove to father that she has business acumen. Once Raina, Dimple and Saira reach and find BK in Goa, they call Ishika over to Goa. As a part of their plan, they instruct Ishika to con BK into investing in the (fake) restaurant by offering him a partnership proposal.BK, apparently unaware of the trap set for him, slowly starts falling for it. Ishika and the 3 girls get BK to pay for Rs 4.5 million in the name of a yacht party to garner publicity for the new restaurant.
However, in the process of conning BK, Ishika falls in love with him, knowing well that BK, in turn, has also fallen in love with her. Ishika is tormented due to a fight between her promise towards the 3 girls vs the true love she has for BK. Ishika says she can't con him anymore because they love each other, but the 3 girls pressurize her. BK, unaware of the trap, comes to meet Ishika, only to find the 4 girls loudly arguing about him.He realizes that he has been setup all this while. He is heartbroken and realizes the pain he gave to everyone when he conned them. But BK remains firm and wanting vengeance for this "trap" the girls tried to set up for him, he now, in turn, makes a plan to con the four girls. Because he truly loves her, BK confesses to Ishika he's a conman and wants to leave this life behind and wants to marry Ishika.The girls see this as a latest attempt by BK to con Ishika & set up a fake "father" of Ishika, who orders BK to buy a plot in the name of Ishika, so she can be safe in case BK absconds. BK agrees, but since he does not have enough cash, he asks Ishika to lend him Rs4.5 million, half of the plot's worth.The deal is made, and all the property papers are transferred to Ishika. But they soon realize that this was all a con by BK: He bought the worthless "swamp" plot for 300,000 under a fake alias, then asked the agent to sell that same land to Ishika (knowing she's involved with the other 3 girls) for 9 million. That way, the money (4.5 million) which Ishika had conned out of BK would come back to him.The three girls blame Ishika for cheating them and vent their anger out on her. Ishika leaves and returns back to Mumbai. The three return to pack up and leave, only to find BK sitting in their garden. He explains why he came back, that he didn't feel good about conning the girl he truly loved, and that the four girls have changed him into now becoming an honest and decent man. He returns their money - Rs.10 million - he stole from the three combined, and leaves.The three girls realize BK's and Ishika's love for each other and reunite them. He lands up in Mumbai, confronts Ishika and proposes to her. In the end, on being probed by Ishika, BK reveals his real name to be "Ricky Bahl", and the movie ends with them kissing each other followed by a song.

Dimple Chaddha, a spoiled and wealthy Delhi girl, falls for her fitness trainer, Sunny Singh, who charms her and pretends to be interested in marriage. He tells her about a disputed inheritance involving a property occupied by tenants. Dimple persuades her father to use his influence to evict the tenants, and they even lend Sunny ₹20 lakh to help him claim the property. However, it is later revealed that the inheritance was fabricated and the tenants were legal occupants. Sunny vanishes with the money, leaving Dimple heartbroken and embarrassed.
Meanwhile, in Mumbai, successful businesswoman Raina Parulekar purchases an expensive painting from Deven Shah, who claims to run an art gallery. Shortly after the transaction, Deven disappears with ₹60 lakh, and Raina learns the painting is fake. She publicly shares her story, which draws the attention of Dimple. They connect and are soon joined by Saira Rashid, a shy and trusting woman from Lucknow who was conned out of ₹10 lakh by a man named Iqbal Khan, whom she was romantically interested in.
The three women realize that Sunny, Deven, and Iqbal are the same man operating under different aliases. They nickname him “Bloody Kameena” (BK) and hatch a plan to con the conman. Raina, using her resources, finances the plan. They recruit Ishika Desai, a sharp-tongued and confident saleswoman from Mumbai, to pose as a wealthy NRI heiress and lure BK in.
Tracking him down to Goa, they discover he is now operating under the name Vikram Thapar, posing as the owner of a beachside water sports business. Ishika approaches him, pretending to be the daughter of a hotel-chain magnate looking to invest in a restaurant. Vikram quickly takes the bait and begins to court her, unaware of the setup.
To impress Ishika, Vikram offers to fund the restaurant’s launch. Meanwhile, the women feed him fake bills, cheap materials, and fake staff, slowly recouping the money he stole from them. As Vikram grows closer to Ishika, he genuinely starts falling for her. After a successful launch party, he and Ishika spend time together and share a kiss. The next morning, he discovers Ishika meeting with the other women and realizes he has been conned.

Later, they find Vikram waiting at their hotel. He confesses to his past cons and expresses remorse, claiming he now understands how it feels to be deceived. He offers to return all the stolen money and insists he wants to turn over a new leaf.
As the women prepare to leave, they notice Ishika is heartbroken over Ricky, and they decide to help reunite the couple. Ricky, now revealing his real name, proposes to Ishika and tells her he wants to learn how to live honestly, with her help.
