Adolf Hitler assists India in its freedom struggle against the British, while Mohandas Gandhi writes to him to end the violence.

[Wikipedia Plot Synopsis]
The film is set during World War II and centres upon the letters written by Gandhi to Adolf Hitler, and around the relationship of Hitler with his long-term lover Eva Braun, whom he married in his final days in the Berlin bunker in which they died. The film depicts the difference between the ideologies of Gandhi and Hitler and claims the superiority of Gandhism over Nazism.
Another plot within the film concerns a young Indian couple who, while both dedicated to gaining independence for India, turn to greatly different paths to achieve that goal. The wife chooses to follow Gandhi, while the husband ultimately joins the Indian Legion, leading to dramatically divergent outcomes. Even though the wife's ultimate fate is not clear, the scenes towards the end show that the husband fails to return to India alive after trying to flee the collapsing Third Reich. The film concludes with the Indian flag flying high and a note stating, "15 August 1947: India wins freedom", demonstrating the superiority of civil disobedience and nonviolence over militancy and terrorism.
