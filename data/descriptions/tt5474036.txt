Rumi (Taapsee Pannu) a free-spirited, vivacious young woman and Vicky (Vicky Kaushal), a young man waiting for his music break are in love and they can't stay out of the bedroom. They both live in Amritsar, and Vicky visits Rumi at early hours of the morning, or late at night to have sex with her in her room, by leaping across neighborhood terraces.When they're caught red-handed by Rumi's family, pressure builds up to get married. Rumi is an orphan, but lives in a house with her grandfather (Arun Bali) and Chacha (Akshay Arora), Chachi (Vishavpreet Kaur) and Rumi's cousin Kiran (Ashnoor Kaur) and Babloo (Rupinderjit Singh).
Rumi's family run a sports equipment shop, and Rumi herself had the potential to be a national level hockey player. But she gave up the sport presumably because it reminded her of her father too much.Despite being caught, both Rumi and Vicky are insatiable and continue to meet in her room, till they are caught again.
The family gives Rumi 2 days to produce Vicky with his parents to ask for her hand in marriage. But Vicky has cold feet and keeps avoiding Rumi's request to bring his parents over and ask her hand in marriage. Vicky argues that he needs more time as he has just started his DJ career and needs to focus on the same.
Eventually, Rumi gives up on him and agrees to an arranged marriage via matchmaker Kakaji (Saurabh Sachdeva).That's when Rajbir Robbie Bhatia (Abhishek Bachchan), a banker, enters the love triangle. Robbie is a banker and lives in London. He has come to India to get married. In India, he lives with his father (Swairaj Sandhu), mother (Neelu Kohli) and brother (Vikram Kochhar).Robbie sees Rumi's photo and wants to meet her for a possible wedding. His other option is Lovely Singh (Sukhmani Sadana) who is a dentist and a very homely girl. But Robbie is now besotted with Rumi. Even Robbie's father says that Rumi will be roller coaster ride, but Robbie does not want to play safe in life.
Kakaji knows that Rumi's affair with Vicky is not hidden from anyone. He visits Rumi's grandfather, who says that the affair is over and that he trusts Rumi not to dishonor the family.Rumi decides to elope with Vicky and leaves with him early in the morning before anyone wakes up. She realizes that while Vicky is there for her but has not thought anything for their future. Vicky had no money, no idea where they were going, and has no clue what they will be doing next. Vicky didn't even know if they were headed to Delhi or Shimla. As such they have no option but to go back. Vicky admits that he is not responsible and hence he also shies away from marrying Rumi, but he also says that he is the only one who can satisfy her sexually. They are both equally passionate about sex.
Again, Vicky decides to bring his parents over to ask for Rumi's hand in marriage. Rumi's family have to say no to Robbie's family (who were about to come to meet Rumi later the same day), in a huge embarrassment. But then again, Vicky fails to show up at the last moment and this time Rumi says yes to Robbie.The families meet. Robbie goes to a bar that night, where Vicky confronts him, that Rumi is his. Robbie knows that Vicky was Rumi's boyfriend but won't ask her about it.
Vicky, meanwhile, gets drunk and threatens Kakaji at his home that Rumi will never marry anyone else. When Rumi finds out, she visits Vicky's house and narrates the whole situation to Vicky's parents. She says that she offered to get engaged and Vicky refused, and now he won't let her get married to anyone else.
Vicky's parents also agree with Rumi.On Mehndi night, Vicky again comes by to meet Rumi to stop her decision to marry Robbie. Rumi comes out and insults Vicky but knows that Vicky is right, and she won't be happy with Robbie. The night before the wedding Rumi goes to meet Robbie and tells him that she is not prepared to get married.Vicky's parents now talk to him to stop meddling with Rumi's life as they know Vicky has never fixated on a goal in life. He wants things to be served to him on a platter and has never worked hard for anything in his life. He just wants the trophy without the sweat and blood. Vicky understands their point and steps back from Robbie and Rumi, who get married.
Rumi is on her honeymoon with Robbie in Manali. Rumi consummates her marriage with Robbie on her second night, when she sees that Robbie is not forcing himself upon her. She messages Vicky, who doesn't message her back.
