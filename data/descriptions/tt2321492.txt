[Wikipedia Plot Synopsis]
The demon king Kans reigns as a tyrant over the Kingdom of Mathura and aims to conquer the world. To put an end to his bloodthirsty reign, the gods decide to incarnate on Earth Vishnu, who is born in the form of Krishna, son of Devaki, the sister of Kans. The baby, nephew of the tyrant, is born in the village of Vrindavan, where he is adopted by the village chief, Nanda, who raises him in the same way as his own slightly older son, Balram. Krishna grows up in a good mood and becomes a mischievous little boy, who makes his mother see all the colors and is always ready to play a trick on the Gopi, the cowherds who watch over him. But he distinguished himself very early on by his miraculous exploits, and the music of his flute charmed men and beasts. Krishna especially befriends a little girl of his age, Radha (his future wife in Hindu mythology), but also befriends several boys, including Madhumangal. He can also count on the help of the monkey Dabiloba and the lamb Hamsi. Krishna must soon come to the aid of the people of the kingdom and face the supernatural perils sent to him by Kans, mainly the demons Trinavarta, Bakasur and Pootna. But, seeing Krishna easily defeating each of his envoys, Kans ends up challenging him to a duel in the coliseum of his capital, resulting in the latter killing him and releasing his parents from the dungeon. Several songs punctuate the film.
