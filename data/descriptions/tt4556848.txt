The film follows Jatin (Taaha Shah), a young law student who visits a hill station with his family. While exploring the town, he encounters a mysterious and beautiful woman named Barkhaa (Sara Loren). He is instantly drawn to her and starts pursuing her, but she keeps her distance.
Jatin soon learns that Barkhaa works as a bar dancer in a shady club. Despite this, he remains infatuated with her and tries to understand her past. Through a series of flashbacks, her tragic story is revealed.
Barkhaa was once a simple and innocent girl living in a village with her father (Puneet Issar), a retired army officer who had strict principles. One day, she met Akash (Priyanshu Chatterjee), a charming and wealthy businessman who showered her with love and promised to marry her. Barkhaa, believing in his love, gave herself completely to him. However, her world shattered when she got pregnant, and Akash abandoned her.
Her father, upon discovering the truth, was enraged and disowned her. Left with no family and no means of survival, Barkhaa ended up in a bar, where she was forced into a life of exploitation and heartbreak.
Back in the present, Jatin is heartbroken after learning about Barkhaa’s past but is still determined to be with her. He convinces her that she deserves love and respect, but Barkhaa, having been betrayed before, hesitates to trust him.
Things take a dramatic turn when it is revealed that Akash, the man who ruined Barkhaa’s life, is none other than Jatin’s elder brother. This shocking revelation creates a conflict between Jatin and his family.
Jatin, unwilling to abandon Barkhaa like his brother did, stands up against his family. However, Barkhaa, realizing that her presence might ruin Jatin’s life and family reputation, decides to leave him. She disappears without a trace, sacrificing her love for Jatin’s future.
The film ends on an emotional note, with Jatin heartbroken but respecting Barkhaa’s decision. It leaves the audience with the message of how societal norms and betrayals can destroy lives, but true love always remains selfless
