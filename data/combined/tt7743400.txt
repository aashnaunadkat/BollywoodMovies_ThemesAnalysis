[Wikipedia Plot Synopsis]
A life-altering disappearance of her 7-year old brother sets Jhalki off on a mission to find him at all costs. Armed with an intimate folk-tale and her own sharp mind, is Jhalki's journey the start of a spiral that will change the lives of thousands for good? What price must she pay to get what she wants? Inspired by true events, with a backdrop of human-trafficking and child-labour, Jhalki becomes an atypical thriller of hope, courage, self-belief and perseverance, seen through the eyes of a 9-year-old girl, who will not stop anywhere short of a triumph.
