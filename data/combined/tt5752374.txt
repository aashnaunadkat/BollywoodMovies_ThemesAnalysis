He is joined by an orthodox Maulana, who is banging doors to collect funds for a madrassa.
Chaudhary's son Raghu (Anirudh Dave) falls in love with a Muslim girl named Zainab (Suha Gezen) in college. Both love each other although Zainab is engaged to Saleem (Hiten Tejwani), a boy from her community. After threats from Saleem, Raghu starts evading her.
