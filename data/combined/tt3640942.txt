[Wikipedia Plot Synopsis]
Koyelaanchal unveils itself through Saryu Bhan Singh, an ex-owner turned Mafioso of the region, who through his sheer brutality and blatant defiance of the law of the land, forces the people and the authorities to acknowledge him as their ‘maalik’. Any protest, any voice of dissent against him, is dealt with spine chilling violence of epic proportions.
Things get a bit difficult to handle for Saryu Bhan Singh when an upright District Collector Nisheeth Kumar takes charge of the region and starts asking him questions that no one dared ask him before. Caught amidst labor revolts and naxal uprisings, the last thing Saryu Bhan Singh wanted was to make enemies with the top government officer in his region. He sends his most lethal human weapon, Karua to scare Nisheeth Kumar off to silence.
But the mission don't-kill-just-scare-him goes horribly wrong when Karua ends up injuring Nisheeth's wife and in the process of escape, ends up carrying Nisheeth's infant also, thus abducting the child. What happens hereafter tells a thrilling and heart-rending story of how the real power doesn't always flow through the barrels of guns but through the tender touches of a child, the love of a mother and the heartfelt prayers of the hopeless millions.

The owners.. ...didn't just control these mine fields.. -Hurry up.. "but also the labors living here. Even after 26 years of independence.. Unscientific mining.. ...poor working conditions of the labors.. ...and extreme exploitation of labors.. ..forced the government to form the Coal Mine Act. But on 1st May 1973 the government centralized all mines.. ..and took over them. But the real owners.. ..were not ready to give up this black diamond.. ...and lose their authority over it. Coal.. So, in order to maintain their authority. ..they discovered new means to exercise it. And thus came in existence, India's most notorious mafia. Coal Mafia. There's just one mafia in this country. And that's the Indian Government. And we're the ones.. ..who protect Koye aancha .. ..from the government mafia. Because I know this is Koyelaanchal. If you walk with your eyes open.. ..your eyes will be filled with coal. Try closing your eyes and you'll be covered in coal. The government servants. ..need my permission to load the coal. Load it up, rascals, what are you all staring at? Here's the delivery order. Don't you get it? Your government papers are no use to us. Your DO comes from my government, not yours. Get that? You simply pass a delivery order from Delhi.. ..and say "Go take coal from Koyelaanchal‘. 'This isn't social justice.' 'The poor and backward people of KoyelaanchaL. ' Raise their voice against this through me.' Why can't I load my coal in my truck? Who says you can't? Go ahead. Just pay manpower difference.. ..of the poor and backward. Lallan. -Yes. Make a difference receipt for him. -Yes. Don't look at me, I am not on duty. I would like to talk to the officer on duty. This is the authority here, sir. Would you like a word?

' To the guard at the check post works only for me.' Sir.. ...I'll be really grateful if you ready my papers soon. If I can leave in daylight. ...I won't have to pass through the barricades at night. If everyone leaves in the day.. ..then what about the guards that patrol at night? But I've completed all the formalities here. The boss will be the judge of that. One needs to give many things other than coal. We've to answer to the masters, not you. Come on, seal you truck and get going. 'The government often keeps.. ' Transferring officers here.. ' To liberate Koyelaanchal from me.' 'It doesn't even make me laugh now.' Rajapur's getting a new Collector. Many have come and gone. If you try to meet them" "you'll have to wait all day at the Collector's Office. Just see, his name will get published soon. They say he's a big righteous. He's received training abroad. That's right. We've sc***d our own people enough. Now we should get to sc**w some foreigners. 'The world's running because.. ' People believe God exists.' 'Koye aancha 's running because.. ' People know.. their Master's there.' 'Saryu Bhan Singh.' Master looks restless. Lord have mercy. The Master's getting a divine revelation. You weren't there.. That was when Rajiv Gandhi was murdered. That day the Master was restless just like this. Karua isn't in Rajapur. That's the only reason. The Master's all alone.. What is it, Sadhu? Nothing.. l.. I was just telling the guards to be more alert. Why hasn't the manager arrived yet? He'll be here soon. I've sent the car to the station.

Mr. Manager. It's been 35 years since the Master became the government.. ..and the manager became the collector. But your mentality hasn't changed. The officer's aren't getting f***d, you all are. The people of Koyelaanchal. And all because of your mentality. Understand. Manager! Ghosh, there's no place for such discussions at my shop. If someone's blood boils up.. ..how will I feed my family? Think about the country. Troubles are coming this way. Clouds of destruction are hovering over us all. If you don't find your ground.. "You'll perish forever. And even history will forget your story. Get the ball. Run! Run! This is the beginning.. ..of Suryu Bhan's end. Wake up people of Koyelaanchal. This is the time" ..to speak up to the Collector. Back in Raniganj..

Hurry up, uncle. -Yes. Give me a hand. Are you going to act when he hurls a bomb at us? This isn't your cup of tea. Uncle! Jha, get these bodies out of there. Sir, we recovered these two hand-made bombs and a gun. But I heard that they were on that tree.. ..when the shots were fired. Maybe, sir. You can't trust these extremists, sir. That means they were shot on that tree. And they fell inside the manor, Jha. Them. They are Maoists, sir. They get shot in China, but die on our land. In India.

Who do I begin with? And against whom? And what price should I be ready to pay? Are you scared? -Aren't you scared? Once a woman returns alive from the labor room.. ..she forsakes all fear. The fear and pain in the labor room teaches you one thing. If you want new hope in life.. "then you have to go through some pain. Nimesh is awake. Go. -I'll be right back. Move. Coming, son. Coming. Your name in the Mine Filling case.. ..and Karua in Bhusan's murder case have been brought up. So? So.. I'll have to lodge an FIR. So go ahead. Until now there were 422. Now there will be 423. I'll have to show an arrest. Who? Are you dreaming? The Collector was the eye-witness in Karua's case. Didn't your Collector puke at the Weighing depot? I guess.. if I make him s**t in his pants.. ...he'll know what Karua is. Go on. I'll handle this matter myself. Bless you. Karua.. Son. Now.. listen carefully to what I say and understand. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I ran into Mishra. And you got an excuse to drink another peg. Absolutely right. I was in the mood to be drunk today, and.. And? This is the last time we come here for dinner.

Can we call him Shahrukh Khan? Uncle. Not me.. it's her. He says it's okay. Eat it, my Shahrukh. Shahrukh. Shahrukh. Eat, Shahrukh. Come home.. when the kid's asleep. Karua. Return him to whomever he belongs. How many more curses are you going to take? He's made you commit sins.. ..and poses as an austere himself. The scoundrel of Rajapur. Do you know the worth of each gun? It's not more than my brother's life. Brother's life or the right of the poor. Your brother got scared by a single blow.. ..and went to plead for his life. That was Bhusan, I am Puran. We might look alike, but" ..you will gradually understand the difference between us. Bravo. Now you sound like a Comrade. To hell with your Comrades. This is about the poor. And don't try to show that you're doing a favor on me. No one cares for the poor without any selfish motives. Not even God. The thing is that. ..you stand to get gain from me.. "that's why you're spending on these. But I have nothing to lose. SO I will fight. Have you seen him? This man with a smiling face? No, mister. I swear I haven't. Okay. Naughty- 'Come here.' 'Come here.' Shahkukh. Don't cry. Shahkukh. Don't cry. Shahkukh. Want a toffee? Here. Shahrukh. Want a toffee? Shahrukh. -Hey. Leave.

Come with me. -Let go. Let me go. Let me go. Why do drag me into this? If you're so worried for him.. ..then return him to his mother. Otherwise go call the one.. ..who made you commit this sin. Butchers. Hit me. -Hit me. I won't go. You've killed many people. Kill me too. Come on. Beat this wench to death. Come on. Hit me. Why don't you hit me? Hit me. Quiet! "The cloud of love." "Knows no weather." "The cloud of love." "The cloud of love." "Knows no weather." "The heart.. " Does as it wants." "The cloud of love." There's Someone higher than your master. Do a good deed in His view. Who knows.. maybe it will wash away your sins. Don't separate the child from his mother.. ..."The cloud of love." "Knows no weather." "The heart.. " Does as it wants." "The cloud of love." "Knows no weather." "My heart does as it pleases." "The cloud of love." What were you saying? Nothing. I was saying.. ...please make my daughter's birth certificate. I'll be grateful. What will be the father's name? Put in your name. You've been coming here before she was born. What did you say? Nothing.. I was just joking. Know your limits. And here's your fee. Your job will be done when the time comes. Hey, naughty. Say Papa- Say papa. -Say papa. Come here. Come here. Say Papa- Say Papa- Say Papa- Say Papa- You won't say it. Papa. Papa-- Say mama. Naughty- Ma.. -Ma.. Ma.. No.. ! Come here.. Yes. <i>Yes, wet.</i> Nisheeth here. I need to setup a meeting as soon as possible, please. Let's all face the facts and accept that.. ..we've been complete failures when it comes to Saryu Bhan Singh. So far we've been able to achieve nothing. Saryu Bhan Singh is above the law. We need to destroy this myth. 40 years in this business. And not arrested even once. What else will people think of him if not a don? A bloody criminal. A third grade bloody criminal. I studied every case of his inside-out. He's never involved directly. For example, take the mine-filing scam. We can get a warrant on Mahavir Earth Shakers. But according to the company documents. "the owner is Vinay Kanojia. His driver. We can arrest. but Vinay Kanojia. Same bloody problem in every damn case. Even if we arrest him on this case.. ...he'll get bail within 24 hours. And then" The situation can get worse. Excuse me, sir. To discuss on how to restore" ...law and order in a small city". ...the Inspector General of Police.. ...Director General of Police.. ..District Collector, District Magistrate.. .. nte igence are meeting secretly" ..in the pool room of a club. How much worse can the situation get? If you want honey.. ..you have to stick your hand in the beehive. Just once, sir. Just once. We need to cuff that rascal Saryu Bhan Singh.. ..and trot him around entire Rajapur. I challenge.. everyone will speak up. But how will you do it? Wait till sunset. Let the court close. Tomorrow and the day after is a holiday. And then Sunday. In three days we've to change Koye aancha 's history. We'll dare.. and the sacred Cows will help us. Careful. What's going on here? Sadhu, what's happening? They're testing our patience. Mr. Collector, what's your problem? I don't, but these poor, helpless animals do. We're here to rescue them. What? Did my cows lodge an FIR? No. A we're taking this action" ...on a senior bureaucrat's complaint. I guess you know Mr. lyer. Mr. lyer, come. Come. Senior bureaucrat, Mr. Kanan lyer. You've kept your animals in a pathetic condition. So many animals in a small cowshed. No place to sit, stand or even breathe. See.. your animals are also hurt. And.. the feeding arrangements are also bad. And you know.. We found this medicine from your cowshed. This medicine is banned by the WHO. What new law are you trying to teach me? This law is called.. Prevention of Cruelty Against Animal Act.. 1960. The one's you're calling animals.. ..are dear to me like my children. And then" how long can you keep them away from me? It will take at least 3 days. But that's okay. You can file an affidavit in the court after that. You will have to pay a fine of 2000-3000. After that. your children will be free.. and you too. Me too? Meaning? It means we're arresting you under.. "Prevention of Cruelty Against Animal Act.. 1960. Rascal.. how dare you cuff your master. I'll erase you from existence" or my name isn't" You can name your pet after me. You don't know.. "what a dire step you're taking. It will burn.. Rajapur will burn! Why has Saryu Bhan been arrested? Would you like to comment on your arrest? Do you think by arresting Saryu Bhan.. ..you can eradicate crime from Koyelaanchal. Do you think there's a political conspiracy behind your arrest. Nobody could arrest Saryu Bhan until now. -No comments please. How did you succeed? Please help us. No comments. -ls it a political conspiracy? The police and administration are hesitating to comment. ..on Saryu Bhan's arrest. People are calling Saryu Bhan's arrest. ..the government's action against the coal mafia. Why are you telecasting wrong news? Along with my master.. "they have also arrested my cows. Cows? -Yes. Now tell me.. how are the cows related to the mafia? He's been arrested because.. "My cowshed is too small.. Hey" What" do you think? Was Saryu Bhan Singh arrested because of the cows? You wait here. Sadho, it's a minor case. -We'll get bail from the station. Talk to the SP. I'll talk to him when he answers my phone. They must have kept him occupied. Listen. Tell sir Sadho's here. Sir's on a leave. He'll be back on Monday. Leave? He was on duty in the morning. He talked to me. He's the senior officer. No one knows when he comes or what he does. Want some tobacco. Give me your phone. He isn't answering my phone. What are you doing? Hurry up. Here. Hello. -Sinha, why aren't you answering my call? Who is speaking? -Who is speaking? Your father" Sadho Singh. Sadho who? -Sadho who? What happened? He hung UP! Don't worry, sir. You won't be kept in a ordinary cell. We've made special arrangements for you. And then.. we've no intentions.. ..of torturing you either. lyer sir. -Yes. There should be no physical torture. Yes. Come. Sit. lyer, won't you offer him water. Here. Water. sorry" Sorry.. Saryu Bhan.. Mr. Saryu Bhan. Lord.. No one should know anything about the master. Absolutely no one. Especially Karua. Karua. Leave everyone. Come on. -Go. Run. What happened, brother? Hello, brother. ls everything fine? Did someone give you any news? I mean absurd. You came on time. I was on my way to the mines. They'll be distributing salaries today. So.. it's important for me to be there. These labors have no rules, you know that. These labors. They are a big.. What happened? Brother. Master's absolutely fine. You're fine too. I am fine too. Everyone's fine. Come. I didn't expect you to stoop so low. Lower than kidnapping a baby. Give me your phone. Let me answer this call. I don't want my people.. ..to get agitated without a reason. It's for your own good. Yes, Shambhu. Greetings. I told you not to call. Master, I want to see you. Not possible. What are my orders? Look after yourself. It's for your own and my good. Give me your phone. Thank you. Uncle, I gave Shahrukh a bath. Look at how handsome he's looking. Uncle, didn't you teach him to wash his s**t. That's because he's still small. No, no, no.. Here.. here.. Shahrukh. Uncle, where's his mother? Uncle. You don't speak at all. In the city. Even my father lives in the city. Have you seen him? She's lying. Her father is dead. What are you whispering? I was asking should I teach" ..Shahrukh the song we learnt in school? Uncle says I can. Fish is the queen of the water. Water is her life.. -No, no, he'll learn my father's poem. Right, Shahrukh Khan. My detractors never thought perhaps. That I am the lamp that good survive the winds of death. That I am the lamp that good survive the winds of death. My father will get me a new frock today. My father too. Liar. I know he isn't coming. A goon killed him. Your master cannot suppress this revolution by killing rebels. Be quiet, my father will come. Liar. I know he isn't coming. A goon killed him. Your father will forget everything after he's drunk. And he won't get you anything. My father doesn't forget. Workers' voice can be suppressed, but can't be killed. Your Master can't suppress revolution by killing the rebels. Your father's a wretch. He won't get you anything you b****. She's a liar. My father will bring a frock. Uncle, tell my father to get my frock. His name is.. Mayku Bhuiyaan. Write 200 Rs against my name. -200? Pay 500. -500? Do you have a problem? I'm paying. Here's 500. Give me a receipt. Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Morning. Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Morning, lyer. -Morning, Nisheeth. Your love-letter has arrived. I guess mine's on the way. These are Saryu Bhan's bail papers, right? Yes, sir. Okay. Hey, Nisheeth, good to see you buddy. I was waiting for you. Sorry. I started using your office.. "without completing the formalities. I hope you understand" and you won't mind it. Hey.. which formality? What formality? The orders has arrived.. that you're the Collector. Then that's final. Hold on, Sadho sir. Hold on. Nisheeth, I just got these orders few hours back.. ..to take charge immediately. And.. your.. Your.. This is your transfer orders. I was asked to hand it over personally. You know how these things happen sometimes. No. No, Sharma, I don't understand why these things happen. I don't understand why these happen sometimes. But with an honest officer.. "this happens all the time. Always" some Khemka is transferred 40 times.. ...in his 20 year career. Some Durgashakti gets suspended.. "without prior notice. Why? The Supreme Court keeps coaxing you.. ..to bring the Civil Services act but you don't listen. They tell you to fix a minimum tenure for officers.. "but you don't listen. Why? Because you want to blindly follow orders. If you want to bully us around, do it openly. Why do you put our honor, dedication and life at stake? I was clearly given in writing" ..to go in that region and create a normalcy. Deal with nuisance elements. And eliminate if required. So that's what I am doing. Then why suddenly am I a nuisance? I am sorry, Sharma, I do not understand. And now I do not want to understand period. See.. ..he's getting so restless. It's because he tightened our grip. He dared to touch my master. I'll kill him in.. Please. Please, Sadho. Please. Nisheeth, don't make it personal. What rubbish, Sharma. I put everything at stake in this war. My life, my career, my family. Even my kid. And you're saying don't make it personal. Have you f**** lost it. The kid will come back, Nisheeth. He'll come. lam your friend, your colleague. Try and understand one thing. It's always about the normalcy". ..about their relationship over here and those in power in there. It's always about those in power there.. ..and those in power over here. That bond is solid. That bond is not broken. Nothing is broken. So you don't need to fix it. I care a f*** about their f**** bond with these criminals. I care a f*** about their attitude towards us. <i>Their W“ greed. Their W“ ‘rndrﬁerences.</i> Their f***** double-standards. What-s this .l.-**** going on? Sharma, I hope you know.. "the meaning of a conspiracy. Don't act smart with us. -I am not acting smart. Then talk in Hindi. Hindi. In our mother tongue. So that I can understand too. I was trying to explain Nisheeth.. ..that he can get his kid back if he leaves. The Administration.. -To hell with his kid. My master's being tortured for the past 48 hours. Don't give me that look. You have no value here. Take your wife and get out of here. Shut the f*** up. Shut up. Collector, you.. Stay down. I said f**** stay down! Sir, you're the Collector and.. Hey lawyer: I am still the Collector here. I haven't received his orders.. ..or handed over my charge. This is my office, and its filled with scam files.. ..and your witness is the prime suspect. I hope you know the meaning of armed intrusion. Sharma. Better explain him. As district Collector what powers I have.. ..to safeguard my sphere of duty. Or do I explain him? -I get it. Come on, Sadhu sir. It's best to leave from here. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, Sadhu sir. This Collector has lost his mind. Sir, technically speaking.. lam on indefinite leave. I can't take anyone's charge.. ..or handover anyone's transfer orders. And you're free to take any action you like. Sharma. Thank you. -Hope not to see you. It was Saryu Bhan's time to die. But took him instead. -Meaning. It means.. if we had taken Saryu Bhan tonight. ..then this would've been his last night. We've information that the tribal descendants plan to attack.. ..his master Saryu Bhan Singh's empire today. When did you get this information? Yeste rd ay. And you're telling me today, lyer. I know.. the situation can get out of control. It's better to stay quiet instead of alerting the system. You know this better. But those" who are losing their innocent kin.. ..in this violence won't understand. I did this for your son. What will you tell Meetu? Where's Nimesh? I'll tell her.. I'll tell her that he's dead. It's easier than saying that. ...I killed the law to save my son. Everyone is informed that. ..Maoist attacked on Rajapur's Naya Mod police station. The entire district is under Maoist attack. The people believe this incident is the result.. ..of the government's effort on.. "putting a leash on the coal mafia. The chief of one of the labor union in this area told us.. This was bound to happen. If you can't protect us.. ..then we'll have to protect ourselves. This attack is a fitting reply from the tribal.. And if this continues, then the coal mafia will soon.. Hi, Nisheeth. Look, sir. We made their leader surrender as well. The battle is won at least. Who won or lost doesn't make a difference. We lost our people on both sides. Poor Indians. So what's the point of this victory? Someday people will sing praises of Puran Santhali. Understand. And anyway, I've made your job easier. Explain them my value. They are dragging me like an animal. I've been trying to explain them. Sir. I think we need him at the press-con. Master told me to keep this from you. You're the master's honor, you're his pride. His last hope. He didn't want to put you in danger. Master has lived all his life for his honor. He even refused to recognize his son's body. To show that no one can murder.. ..Saryu Bhan Singh's son. He hasn't even performed the final rites. One has to say that the young master's lives abroad. What to do? It's the question of master's honor. 40 years. I've kept the master's honor intact for 40 years. Time's changing. The master's been damned. The effect's going to show. If they master stays alive". ...he'll never be able to tolerate it. The master's lived all his life with pride.. ..so send him away similarly. Give him salvation. If he dies by your hand, he'll be immortal. One Karua kills the other" ..it doesn't look good. <i>He's a mad ha“</i> Nisheeth.. we cannot negotiate with these people. Except for death. lam the administrative head of this district, sir. Collector. Still I'm letting him use me.. ..for my own personal interest. What message will the people get from this? Do you think I am being selfish? In the last 24 hours 113 soldiers died. Even we are normal people with family. This message should be delivered to the people. Otherwise they will either consider us God or the devil. I am as strong as you are. I am as helpless as you are. Try to understand. Help us. This message should be delivered to the people. Give me strength, Goddess. Why did he call us here? Because he knows no one can follow him here. Forget about running, you can't even walk here. This is their personal hell.. ..and only they can thrive here. Where is he? Hello. Have you brought the master along? Yes. Send him. ls my son fine? Call Saryu Bhan. Go on. Saryu Bhan. He has my child. I'll be grateful if you spare his life. You've shown me so many facets of death. I can't comply with it all my life. Please show a facet of mercy.. ..and I'll be grateful forever. I wish you had shown this compassion on day 1.. ..then this would've never happened. Your foolishness has made the entire area insecure. Mr. Collector, you humiliated his father. This is coal religion. They understand only one law. Either burn yourself or decimate others. This is why everyone worships coal here. It won't be easy to convince him. But I will try. So.. you got the news. Why are you crying? I am absolutely fine. Such high and lows are normal. But why did you come here? Don't you know how dangerous this place is? And you called me here too. Karua, leave with the child. Can you see the child? He's on the ground there. But God knows what they are up to. I won't leave my land. You have to Karua. They've got you in their sights. I am there. I'll clear them out. No, master. Tell this land to devour me. Karua. What are you saying? I beg you. I know no God, except for you. You're my day and night. I breathe because of you. You're the benefactor of my world. I never asked you for anything. But I will today. Order Koye aancha .. ..to devour us both. Karua. Yes, master. Give the orders. Son, what's going on in your mind? If you're blamed for my sins, then" ..may the merits of good deeds be conferred on you. I understood one thing, Master. In order to keep your world intact. ...I ruined heaven. I want to rectify my mistake, master. Help me. Liberate Koyelaanchal. Tell Koyelaanchal to devour us. Say it, Master. Order Koye aancha .. ..to devour us. Say it, master. Help me. Liberate Koyelaanchal. Say it, master. Order Koyelaanchal. Order Koyelaanchal. Say it, Master. Order Koyelaanchal. Devour us Koyelaanchal. Devour us. Devour us Koyelaanchal.
