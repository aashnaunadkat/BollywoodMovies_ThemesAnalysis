[Wikipedia Plot Synopsis]
The movie starts with the happy life of a mother and daughter back in 1934. In the present, 2016, Dr. Krishnakumar (Siddharth), a successful neurosurgeon, and his wife Lakshmi (Andrea Jeremiah) live peacefully in their beautiful house under the mountains in Rosina Valley. The D'Costa family moves into the next house, which belonged to the mother and daughter years ago. Jennifer D'Costa (Anisha Angelina Victor) is a troubled teenage daughter of the neighbors. Though she is rebellious, she deeply loves her family and her half-sister Sarah. Jenny and Sarah come to meet Lakshmi and make friends with her. Jenny is instantly attracted to Krish's charm. 
The D'Costas invite Krish and Lakshmi for dinner. While exploring the house, Krish sees Jenny jumping into the well and saves her. Jenny's rebellious nature makes her do things like smoking. During one such time, when she sneaks out of the house for a smoke, she picks up some belongings of a dead person. Jenny starts to act weird soon and sleepwalks to the edge of a cliff, where her father Paul (Atul Kulkarni) and Krish save her yet again. Jenny's grandfather contacts a psychic, but Paul refuses to take any help from him. Krish refers them to his psychiatrist friend Dr. Prasad (Suresh), who gives Jenny a hypnotherapy session, and she tells him that there is someone telling her family to leave the house, and then Jenny starts speaking in Chinese. Prasad concludes she has developed paranoia with visual and auditory hallucinations and advices Paul to perform an exorcism since he is sure of some paranormal behaviors happening with Jenny. Paul calls Pastor Joshua (Prakash Belawadi) to perform the exorcism, and they find that their new house is haunted by three ancient Chinese spirits. One of them is a bloodthirsty man, while the other two spirits are the mother and the daughter, who want the family to get out of the house without trouble. The exorcism session cures Jenny, but the violent antics of the spirits injure Joshua, who falls into a coma, while Krish and Paul are also injured. 
Things seem normal, and Lakshmi finds out that she is pregnant, but one day, Paul's housemaid disappears. Krish and Lakshmi also witness increasing paranormal disturbances in their daily lives. Paul finds some disturbing evidences in his house and agrees to call the psychic from earlier, and he reveals the presence of a mother and daughter spirit, asking them to leave. He also discovers their skeletal remains in the nearby cliff edge, along with the male spirit's remains. 
Meanwhile, Prasad feels that there is more to the story of the spirits from Jenny's exorcism and upon researching finds that there is a witness who knows what happened in Paul's house 80 years ago, an old lady from the village. Krish and Prasad visit the old lady, who reveals that the man of the house, Lu Wei, was into black magic. He attempted to kidnap and kill her when she was a child, but his pregnant wife intervened and let her escape. It is shown that Lu Wei tried to perform the human sacrifice as a ritual so that his next offspring would be a boy. When his ritual was disturbed, Lu Wei heartlessly lures his own daughter and sacrifices her instead. Lu Wei's distraught wife witnesses this and stabs herself in the stomach, killing her and her unborn child and thereby ruining Lu Wei's plans. An enraged Lu Wei commits suicide by drowning himself in the well. The old lady further tells that all these events unfolded during a rare solar eclipse day, and a similar eclipse is bound to happen again the next day.
Krish and Prasad go back home and seemingly continue to discuss the events. The next day, Lakshmi calls out for Krish and asks him to help Jenny, since she is possessed again. When they go to Jenny's house, to Krish's surprise, Lakshmi locks him up in a room. It is then revealed that Joshua awoke from his coma and told Lakshmi that during Jenny's exorcism, he found that not only Jenny was possessed by the woman's spirit, but Krish was possessed by Lu Wei's spirit and the possession must have happened when Krish jumped into the well and rescued Jenny. Lu Wei now intends to continue where he left off and targets Sarah for his human sacrifice so that Lakshmi would give birth to a boy. It is shown that a possessed Krish had earlier killed Prasad too, since he found the truth. Krish breaks free and tries to kill Sarah and cause mayhem, but the Chinese mother-daughter spirits overpower him and destroy Lu Wei's spirit from Krish's body as the solar eclipse ends, and Krish gets back to normal. 
A few years later, it is shown that Krish's family and the D'Costas are still good neighbors, while Lakshmi and Krish now have a son, with whom Jenny and Sarah go to play. The screen closes in on the boy's eye, which changes to show double irises, implying that he could be demonic, since he was conceived when Krish was possessed by Lu Wei.

I won't share anything with your father. Okay? Okay. Did you experience anything strange at home? Yeah, one night, my father's Dictaphone started playing. I went and switched it off, but it started to play again. So, I removed the batteries. Why do you think it happened? Perhaps, the play button was broken. Correct. And if at all Jenny was present there she would've made up something out of it. -What do you mean? -Well... Only after I get to have more sessions with Jenny I would be able to diagnose her properly.

Take a deep breath. Focus on the darkness. Be attentive to this ticking sound. You'd feel sleepy now. <i>Don't fight it.</i> <i>Just relax.</i> When I... snap my fingers like this. You'll have to answer my questions. Okay? Once again when I snap my fingers, you'll have to wake up. Think of it as an 'On' and 'Off' switch. <i>And follow the same.</i> Jenny. Don't you like this place? Do you wish to go back to your old house? Initially, I never used to like it here. But later, Dad convinced me to live here. Now I like it here. And there's Krish who lives next door. This cold weather... now I like everything. If you like everything here... then why did you go to that mountain the other day? I didn't go. <i>Why did you go to that mountain</i> <i>and had everyone scared?</i> I'm telling you, I didn't go. So can I talk to the one who went up there? Why are you quiet? I'm talking to you, tell me. This is my house. Jenny? No one can live hear. She's said, "This is my house." "No one else can live here." Who are you to say this? Li-Jing. It's her name. Jenny? What are you doing? What are you doing? I am wiping the blood on my stomach. She said, "Wiping the blood stains on my stomach." Jenny? Jenny? Jenny? Doctor! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Listen to me, relax! Jenny? Wake up, Jenny. What did I say? What happened, Dad? Do you have a family priest? Priest? -For what? -I'll let you know. We're Pentecostal Christians. We have Pastor Joshua at the local church. In order to save Jenny... we would need his help. <i>Earth to earth.</i> <i>Ashes to ashes.</i> <i>Dust to dust.</i> <i>In sure and certain</i> <i>hope of resurrection.</i> <i>And lastly, in to your</i> <i>hands, Oh merciful savior.</i> <i>We commend, your servant.</i> <i>And we commit the body</i> <i>to the ground.</i> <i>Blessed, peace of</i> <i>everlasting rest.</i> <i>In the...</i> <i>In the company of</i> <i>the glorious company of</i> <i>Saints of Light.</i> <i>Amen.</i> We always offer blessings. But today, Dr. Prasad has come to meet me. What can I do for you? We need you to perform an exorcism on Paul's daughter, Jenny. Exorcism? Our child is possessed? I'm a professional psychiatrist. Jenny is most definitely not possessed. Then why do you need me? Actually, she's been quite unhappy these days. She still hasn't come out of the trauma her mother's demise. She started to develop some stories of her own. And now she believes that those imaginary stories are real. She's feeling very lonely out here. She doesn't know how to deal with this. She believes that Li-Jing's ghost has possessed her. If you ask, why Li-Jing? <i>She must have read a</i> <i>book of this sort.</i> <i>She might have watched a film</i> <i>Or it must be the internet.</i> <i>Or, she must have started this</i> <i>to drive away boredom.</i> <i>Now she strongly</i> <i>believes that Li-Jing</i> is bound to send everyone away from this house. Hold on a second, Doc. We both heard it clearly. She was speaking Chinese. <i>I checked it on</i> <i>Google Translate.</i> Google Translate. She's fooling herself. Classic psychosomatic behavior. That's why we'll have to perform a fake exorcism and get done with it. But, doctor, isn't there a medical treatment for this issue? This fake exorcism is a treatment by itself, Paul. Only then, Jenny will believe that Li-Jing's soul has left her body. I'll follow the procedure of an exorcism. You may call it a treatment... or a deception. We... will take this as a blessing. Don't worry. Our child will be alright. This plan, Jenny's exorcism... I just don't get it. Whatever we're doing is for Jenny's good. Dr. Prasad. Psychiatrist. Man of Science. What you're doing doesn't match your profession. Brain surgeon! You cut open the human brain and massage it. And you doubt my techniques? I sure do, Doc. We're going to perform a fake exorcism, right? -Yup! -Then why do we need a real Pastor? It's for Jenny, Krish. She's got to believe it. Even if the believer is a fool... his beliefs are everything to him. Different rules for different fools. -Good morning, doctors. -Morning! My mother would always say... if you need to light a lamp all you need is oil. But if you're looking for light... you need faith. Faith! Shall we? Everything will be fine. Lizzie, please. You stay back. -Colonel, please take care of her. -Okay, Doctor. -Paul. -Sit down. -Are we ready? -Yeah. Please. 22nd February, 2016. The exorcism of Jenny D'costa. <i>Dad, who's this?</i> We've never met. I'm Pastor Joshua. How are you, Jennifer? <i>Jennifer?</i> Everyone calls me Jenny. Jenny. Why am I surrounded by so many people? I'm scared. It was that room the other day and today it's this room, that's it. Okay? Okay. What are you going to do? You were wiping blood of your stomach that day. Whose blood was it? Who is it that you had killed? What are you saying, Doctor? I don't understand. I'm not talking to you, Jenny. Li-Jing. If you don't talk to us Pastor Joshua will make sure to chase you away. Then you will not be able to use Jenny for your advantage. -Jenny? -Paul. Don't be scared. I did not kill anyone. Start the procedure please. Lord, the Father in heaven. Lord, the Father in heaven. Lord the Father in heaven, the most merciful. <i>Bless us.</i> <i>Have mercy upon us.</i> Oh, wicked spirit. Release this gentle soul unto our Lord. <i>Behold the cross of the Lord.</i> <i>Flee bands of enemies,</i> <i>we drive you from us.</i> Whoever you may be, unclean spirits. In the name of Jesus Christ, our God and Lord. <i>We confidently undertake to repulse, the</i> <i>attacks and deseeds of the devil.</i> <i>The Lord's enemies are</i> <i>scattered and driven away.</i> All Satanic powers. Pastor, do something. She's not your Jenny. There's something else inside of her. Here on, saving Jenny, is my responsibility. All infernal invaders. <i>All wicked legions, all assemblies...</i> <i>God arises,</i> <i>his enemies are scattered.</i> <i>And those who hate him, flee before him.</i> <i>As wax melts before fire</i> <i>so the wicked perish at</i> <i>the presence of God.</i> All wicked legions. Dr. Prasad, get me a rope, right away. Dr. Prasad! Krish! God arises, his enemies are scattered. <i>And those who hate him, flee before him.</i> <i>The smoke is driven away.</i> <i>As wax melts before the fire</i> <i>so the wicked perish at</i> <i>the presence of God.</i> <i>-Behold the cross of the Lord.</i> -Doc! <i>-Flee bands of enemies.</i> -Doc! <i>-The lion of the tribe of Judah</i> -Doc, help me. <i>-the offspring of David hath conquered.</i> -Doc! <i>May thy mercy, Lord descend upon us.</i> <i>As great as our hope, in thee</i> <i>we're driven.</i> <i>Dr. Prasad!</i> <i>Dr. Prasad!</i> No! Krish! Come on, Krish. -Come on. -I command you, unclean spirit. -Whoever you are -Hold her. <i>along with all your</i> <i>minions now attacking this servant of God.</i> Doc, hold her. God, the Father of our lord Jesus Christ. Heed my prayer, may the Lord be with you. -I adjourn you, Ancient Serpent -Hold her. unto our Lord. In the name of our Lord and God... <i>I adjourn you to depart</i> <i>forthwith in fear</i> <i>from this servant of God.</i> I adjourn you, Ancient Spirit by the judge of the living and of the dead. Depart forthwith from this servant of God. Behold this, the cross of our Lord. We drive you from us, whoever you may be <i>all wicked legions,</i> <i>assemblies and sects.</i> In the name and by the power of... The girl will die. Jennifer? Jennifer? Everyone calls me Jenny. Dad? Jenny! God is good. Oh Lord, have mercy. Krish. Come on, Krish. Krish! Come on, get up. Jenny? Jenny, are you okay? You alright? Pastor? He's alive. <i>The girl will die.</i> <i>The girl will die.</i> March, 2016. Silent Hill Hospital. Vitals are stable. Pulse is consistent. Change the dressing tomorrow. And monitor him every two hours. Okay? Um... Doctor, if any special treatment or surgery is required please go ahead. You don't have to worry about the cost. As I said... we can't perform a surgery until he's out of the coma. Nurse, once you've filed the reports, go to your ward. -I'll see you there. -Okay, Doctor. We need your touch. We wait on you. You're our savior. Our friend... and our hope. Amen. They've been praying for him relentlessly. They can at least pray for him. What do I do? For my guilty conscience. I keep asking myself, "Why did I get him involved in this?" This question has been pricking me every moment. <i>We have the same</i> <i>guilty conscience.</i> It all happened for the sake of my daughter. <i>Don't worry.</i> How's everyone at home? Jenny seems absolutely normal. I'll check on Pastor and then leave. Krish. That day, when I saw Pastor Joshua for the last time I saw a strange fear in his eyes. Did you notice that? I didn't. I have a feeling that there's something more to this incident, Krish. Doc... didn't Paul just say that Jenny is normal now? Correct. But do we know everything that we are supposed to? Up until we ask the right question, we won't get the right answer. But only Pastor Joshua has the right answer. <i>Krish, we can't wait until</i> <i>he regains consciousness.</i> That means, you're not going to stop until you get all the answers. Tell me, what you want to do? I'm with you. <i>Paul!</i> Yeah? Everyone's gathered at one place? We need to talk, Paul. -Yeah. -After everything that happened... is it vital for us to be in this house? <i>Let's go away, please.</i> <i>Yes, Paul.</i> Yes, Lizzie is right. We should leave from this house. I've pawned this house as collateral for the loan for the Power Plant Project. If they come down for inspection and find this house locked the loan application would be canceled. Mom, I had told you that he'll get upset. Why are you guys still scared? We can stay in this house. <i>I'm absolutely fine now.</i> Please stop torturing Dad with this. Please. <i>Dad...</i> whatever happens, will happen for good. Just give another chance to me and to this house. Please. <i>'I pray to Lord Brahma,</i> <i>Murari and Tripurantakari.'</i> <i>'The Sun, the Moon,</i> <i>Mars and Mercury...'</i> <i>'I pray to Lord Brahma,</i> <i>Murari and Tripurantakari.'</i> <i>'The Sun, the Moon, Mars and Mercury.'</i> <i>'Jupiter, Venus, Saturn...'</i> Sir! What are you doing? Sir! Every time... things missing, Sir. Knife missing... bad smell. Fridge, Sir. Ghost in... house, Sir. I do prayer. Don't scare everyone at the house with this nonsense. Every time... meaning. Sir, every different meaning, sir. Not good for family. Hey, stop it! Don't do this nonsense... Don't do this in front of the kids. Got it? -Understood? <i>-Okay, sir.</i> Go to bed. If I catch you doing this again... you won't be spared. -Lakshmi!? <i>-Oh my God! Oh my God!</i> What happened? Krish, do you see this strip? If you see two lines on this, it means that I'm pregnant. There are two lines and I'm pregnant. You do realize that I'm a doctor, right? I love you! Who's the father? I love you too! It's your agency who had sent her. If the agency itself doesn't know, then who does? You find out and let us know. Thank you. -Nonsense. <i>-She's crazy.</i> <i>She left without even</i> <i>taking her stuff.</i> <i>Wonder what was the emergency.</i> Paul, I think you should try and call-- Paul? <i>Ghost in...</i> <i>house, Sir.</i> <i>I do prayer.</i> Dad. please call the psychic. Right now. Everyone has their own way to talk to the spirits. Some roll the dice to talk to the spirits... while some use pen and paper. It was through sand art, when a spirit first spoke to me. <i>They communicate...</i> <i>through the sand.</i> This is Mr. Chang. Chinese translator. He was very helpful during Jenny's hypnosis. That's why, I called him. <i>'Devotion to the mystic</i> <i>law of the Lotus Sutra.'</i> Is there someone in this house? Is there anybody in this house? Dad! She's here. You can speak to them through me. I'll let them know. You can speak to them through me. I'll let them know. There are two spirits. It's the spirits of a mother and her daughter. Get out of here. Everyone will be killed. Everyone will be killed. Why will they get killed? Why would everyone be killed? Lizzie. You were right. We will no longer stay in this house. We'll leave right away. Come on. They're not finished yet, Paul. These two spirits... were scaring you to chase you away. But apart from these two spirits... there's another spirit. Which is stopping you from leaving. <i>There's no use of running now.</i> <i>No matter where you go, that</i> <i>spirit won't let go of you.</i> <i>I'm sorry, Paul.</i> Jai, I was waiting for you. Come in. Doctor, here's the file you had asked for. Sit. This case is 80 years old. That's why it took a while to find it. Lakshmi? Who is that? Is someone there? Lakshmi? Hey, hey! Baby, what happened? What happened? Did you have a nightmare? It's okay, go back to sleep. Lie down. The child's heartbeat is normal, Krish. So nothing to worry. And you need bed rest for the next two-three days. After that, you'll be completely alright. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. There's something inside Paul's house, Krish. We should leave our house. That's their house. Why should we leave our house? Why did you need to climb up the water tank? You slipped and fell down. It was an accident. There's no connection between the two, Lakshmi. <i>No, I didn't slip.</i> When I climbed up... I saw a little girl, at top of the tank. That's why I got scared and fell down. The spirit in their house... has entered in our house too. <i>Calling, Dr. Krish.</i> <i>Calling, Dr. Krish.</i> <i>Dr. Krish to the OT.</i> I have to go. You take rest. <i>Doctor?</i> <i>Dr. Arun is done with</i> <i>his Pre-Op procedures.</i> <i>We're shifting him to the OT.</i> <i>We can go ahead with</i> <i>the local anesthesia.</i> Doctor, can we go ahead with the procedure? Just finish prep, I'm coming. Mr. Arvind, this is a different kind of surgery. During this surgery you can talk to me and to Dr. Shekar too. Shall we begin? I'm going to insert the electrodes in to your brain. You won't feel any pain, but will tickle a bit. Let's begin. Okay? Inserting electrodes. Once the electrodes are inserted you'll be able to stop the shivering in your hand. Deep brain stimulation is-- Is everything okay, Doctor? Nothing. Nurse? Dab please. Deep brain stimulation is a two way street, Arvind. Thanks. Again. Concentrate, Arvind. You'll have to concentrate just as much. Stop the shivering, and stre-- Doctor, are you sure you're okay? I know what I'm doing, Sekhar. Go and stand there. You're here to observe. Let's continue. Arvind, keep your hand steady. And then lift the little finger of your right hand. No. Your hands are still shaky. Try once again. Try relaxing. Relax! We'll... We'll try proceeding now. Inserting the the electrodes. What have you done? Doctor, please step aside. Nurse, get a shot of dopamine. Quick! <i>I think he's getting</i> <i>a cardiac arrest.</i> <i>Hold him!</i> Dr. Usha Hegde. (Cheif of Surgery) <i>I haven't forgotten what you've</i> <i>done for this hospital, Dr. Krish.</i> The truth is, if you were disturbed, you shouldn't have walked in to the OT. Luckily, the patient is alive. If not... I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm going to have to suspend you. Think of it as a break. <i>Take care of your wife.</i> Krish! Two minutes. Years ago... something happened in Paul's house. In order to know more, I'm going to a village nearby. I'll come too. Lakshmi? She just needs to rest now. Nurses will take care of her. I need to know what's happening, Doc. I just can't take it anymore. Okay, I'll wait for you downstairs. Did you find anything old when you moved in here? I don't think so... <i>If you feel attached to some item, your</i> <i>emotions are bound to get invested.</i> <i>Only people with ESP</i> <i>abilities can feel it.</i> <i>I'm one of them.</i> <i>"Little sparrows have gone</i> <i>Back to their nests"</i> <i>"Little lambs are on their way home"</i> <i>"My baby, the moonlight is gently swaying"</i> Where did you find this? Lakshmi said that she saw something. I didn't believe her. I saw it too, in the operation theater. What's happening inside that house, Doc? Eighty years ago... there used to live a Chinese family, where Paul's family is living right now. A man called, Lu Wei his wife and their daughter. Lu Wei was a silk trader. He used to import raw silk from China and sell it here to the Kings, Princes and the British officials. They lived there for many years. And suddenly, one day... their dead bodies were found in the house. What? -How did they die? -No idea. But, I've come to know from the police records that a little girl was an eye witness to it. They say, she was absolutely scared to speak, then. We're going to meet that same girl now. If she wasn't able to speak then will she speak now, after so many years? I don't know. But I know one thing. The future of Paul's family is connected to that girl's past. Can we go a little faster? I come here whenever I feel like smoking. Very rarely, Dad. I found that comb under this tree. We will have to dig this place. Stop! Move aside. This is a woman's skeleton. She was pregnant, when she died. This one, is a small kid. This kid's throat was slit. <i>People have cooked up many stories</i> <i>in regards to that Chinese house.</i> But we'll only be able to save the family if you tell us the truth. Tell us if you remember anything about that day, please. Considering my age, I've forgotten about many things. But... I'll never be able to forget... what happened that day. The others would only let you know what they heard from someone else. But, I was the only one who witnessed that incident in person. It was during 1935. I must have been eight years old. <i>There was a beautiful</i> <i>tree at that house.</i> <i>I used to go there, to</i> <i>pluck flowers from that tree.</i> There lived a Chinese man. <i>I used to be very scared of him.</i> Hello, Paul? <i>-He had a wife...</i> -Hello? Hello, Paul? and a daughter of my age. <i>And that lady always used to</i> <i>let me pluck the flowers.</i> <i>One day, when I went</i> <i>there to pluck flowers...</i> <i>they weren't there.</i> <i>Only that man was present there.</i> Let me go. Let me go! What are you doing? Let her go! According to this scroll, for ages a boy child has taken birth when a girl child has been sacrificed. on the day of total solar eclipse What is this madness? Let her go! Suddenly, the color of the sky changed. And, the daylight submerged in to the darkness of the night. <i>There was a solar</i> <i>eclipse on that day.</i> According to these ancient scrolls a boy is born if a girl child is sacrificed on the day of a total solar eclipse. And it has to be done before the solar eclipse ends. What has happened to you? Why are you talking like this? Oh Dark Lord! Look at this! Oh Dark Lord. Look at this! Oh Dark Lord. You have ruined it. There is very little time left. Now I have no other choice. I am going to sacrifice our daughter, Li Min. I will not allow this. Shall we play a game? Okay, Dad. Do you want a baby brother to play with? Yes, Dad. I do. -Then you must do as I say. -Yes, Dad. What should I do? Come, place your head here. If a boy can only be born by sacrificing a girl then such a child is not required. And even if it is a boy, you shall never have him. <i>"The stars in the sky are your company"</i> <i>"Tomorrow will be another good day"</i> <i>"My baby, sleep in my arms"</i> This is not the end. Just the beginning. <i>"Baby I love you</i> <i>In your sweet dreams"</i> <i>"Little lambs and the stars"</i> <i>"Will join and play with you"</i> Since then, I get really tensed just by the mere mention of the solar eclipse. Tomorrow... there will be a solar eclipse, once again. <i>Once again.</i> All this while, these spirits were just trying to warn you. But Lu Wei's soul was... not letting you leave. You said it was Paul's call, anything urgent? I've been trying, but there's no network. I'll try once again. Go away. Nurse? Nurse! Nurse! Go away. Oh my God! Somebody help me! Help me, please! March 9th, 2016. Day of the total solar eclipse. Where are Jenny and Sarah? Call them quick. Paul, it's not safe to leave until the eclipse is over. It's better to leave rather than stay here and wait for death. Lizzie! But how is the eclipse connected to this? One second. Yeah, tell me dear. Krish, where are you? I need to talk to you, in person. <i>Where's Jenny?</i> Jenny? No idea. Doc and I are headed to Paul's house. Is that so? I'll get discharged from here and see you there. So you're going to be there too? <i>-Yeah.</i> -Okay. <i>Today's solar eclipse is</i> <i>believed</i> <i>to be a total solar eclipse.</i> <i>It will be the longest</i> <i>in 100 years.</i> <i>-It will last for</i> -Ma'am? <i>-seven and a half minutes.</i> -Ma'am, sign. <i>It has attracted many tourists and</i> <i>researchers to Himachal Pradesh.</i> <i>People have been warned that it should not</i> <i>be looked at without proper precautions.</i> <i>The warning has been issued</i> <i>by the Meteorological Department.</i> Krish! Pastor has regained consciousness. That's good. Did he say something? He wasn't able to speak well. But he's asked to keep Jenny locked inside a room for the next hour. Okay. Doc just called, he said he'll be here in ten minutes. He asked us to be with Jenny until the eclipse is over. Paul. Where's Jenny? -Jenny? -She's packing her stuff. I need to talk to her. Why? What happened? Nothing to worry, I'll let you know later. Krish, come. Is Sarah with Jenny? She must be around. Krish! What happened? Check if Jenny is inside. Why don't you check, Lakshmi? Sarah! Please, Krish. I'm scared. Jenny? Jenny! She's not here. Look properly. Please look, Krish. Jenny? Not every spirit is against God. But there is one, at Paul's house. Dad? Pastor said that, Krish is the reason behind everything bad that's happened in here. <i>Lakshmi, open the door.</i> Krish has been possessed by the soul of the man who died in this house. What? <i>Paul!</i> -Krish is not in his senses. <i>-Open the door!</i> Someone will die before the eclipse is over. I can't stop him by myself. We all have to stop him together. <i>Paul!</i> <i>Lakshmi!</i> <i>Open the door!</i> <i>Open the door!</i> <i>This is not the end.</i> Lu Wei had sacrificed his own child in this house. But he didn't get what he had desired for. Today, Lu Wei will definitely use Krish to fulfill his motives. Oh my God! Dr. Prasad... praying to God? Why? Let me tell you. Li Jing's spirit, possessed Jenny to save Paul's family at any cost. <i>But from whom?</i> <i>When I was going through</i> <i>these records...</i> I came to know that Lu Wei and you Dr. V. S. Krishna Kumar have the same birth dates. <i>Different year but same date.</i> Same person? <i>That's the reason I was praying.</i> Because if the Devil exists, then so does God. <i>I asked you not to</i> <i>analyze my brain, Doc.</i> This way. Jenny... where's Sarah? Krish? Jenny, Sarah? Both of them are with Paul, they'll be safe. How do we stop Krish? I'll distract him. You guys try to get the kids out of here. Sarah. Where is Sarah? Sarah? No. Sarah, hide. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Krish, please. Please, Krish. Listen to me. Krish. Krish, you're true but the one inside you is not. Krish, look at me. No. Sarah. Sarah, run. Run, Sarah. She can run, but she can't hide from me. The girl will die. Dad. -Dad! -Sarah, run! Please, spare my child. Dad! Why did you stop? Chase us! Why are you standing there? Come. Sarah, run! Run! She's gone from here. She's not in the house. Krish, please let my sister go. Please! Sarah? What are you up to, dear? I was waiting for you, Dad. Do you want a little brother to play with? I do, Dad. Then, you'll have to listen to me. Okay, Dad. I'll listen to you. Come and place your beautiful face here. Okay, Dad. Hey! Krish! Let her go, Krish. Please let her go. Let the kid go. The girl will die. -This girl should die. -No. With her death, a boy will be born. No, Krish. Krish, listen to me. Krish, I'll kill myself. If a boy can only be born by sacrificing a girl... then such a child is not required. <i>And even if it s boy,</i> <i>you shall never have him.</i> Sarah! Krish, don't do it. No! Sarah! Krish, no. Krish, no. Krish! Paul! Krish! Pin him down! Krish, listen to me. Krish! Lizzie, take Sarah away. Sarah! Come on! Sarah! Sarah! Krish, no. No, Krish. Li-Jing? Let him go. We've done what was required of us. The eclipse is over. They'll take care of him now. Krish. This is not the end. Krish? Krish? Oh my God, Krish. Krish, can you hear me? Krish? -Lakshmi? -Yes. -Sarah, baby. -Yes. -Dad! -Mom. What happened? Nothing. Nothing, dear. Shall we go home now? Morjim Beach, Goa. 4 years later. -Hi! -Hi! Come in. -Hi. -Hey! Welcome home. -So good to see you. -Thank you. -Parson School of Design. -Wow! I've heard a lot about that college. -Yeah! -It's in New York, right? Great news. -Yeah. -When are you leaving? She said she won't leave until she meets Krish. I meant both Krish and Lakshmi. In fact, the three of them. Where's our hero? -Oh, him? -Where's he? He must be playing in his room. Hey! <i>Rishi!</i> <i>You always do your thing.</i> <i>I need you!</i> If a boy can only be born by sacrificing a girl then such a child is not required.
