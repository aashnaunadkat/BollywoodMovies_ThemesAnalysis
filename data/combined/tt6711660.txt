Babu Bihari (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is a hit-man hired by both to get rid of their rivals. He kills for a paltry sum of Rs. 20,000, of which 5000 is the commission to a constable who gets him the hit job. Babu is ferocious & has a very direct approach to hitting his target. He has a reputation of clean hits without any fuss.Babu leads a very simple life, lives alone in a shanty in a remote location. One fine day Jiji offers him a hit job of a local muscleman. Babu goes survey the routine of his target. There he comes across Fulwa (Bidita Bag) a Cobbler. He is smitten by her beauty & impressed with her head strong attitude. He tries to court her, but his advances are rejected by her. Meanwhile, he kills his target, which is witnessed by Fulwa.In the police investigation, she refuses to identify him. Babu barges into her home & she stabs him instinctively with a sharp tool. Babu somehow manages to control the damage & tells her that he came because he was curious why she did not divulge any information to the police. She tells her that the guy he just killed & his 2 brothers forced themselves upon her repeatedly. She tells him if he kills rest of the 2 brothers she would spend her entire life with him. Babu promptly kills the 2 remaining brothers.
When he returns for his payment Jiji is furious with him. As he has ruined her plan. It was on the insistence of the younger brother, that she killed the elder brother to forge an alliance with the remaining 2 brothers for upcoming elections. This puts Babu in bad books with Jiji.
Here Babu & Fulwa have a great time & enjoy each other's company. On the other hand, Dubey feels that 3 muscle men (Bahubali) of Jiji are an obstacle to his prospects of winning the election. He gives the contract to kill all 3 Bahubalis to Babu. Babu goes to Jiji & informs her about the contract. He throws an open challenge to her to save her men if she can. He is about to hit his first kill when a bullet is already shot missing its target. In the ensuing chaos, the victim escapes. It turns out that there is another hit-man given the same contract. Babu saves the second hit-man from the enraged mob. The second hit-man is Bakey (Jatin Goswami), who considers Babu as his guru. Although furious at first that he ruined his kill, Babu makes amends with Bakey. They decide to make this as a game. Of the 3 kills whoever scores higher will win & loser will have to leave the profession.Babu scores the first kill. He is about to score the second hit, but a cop loyal to Jiji intervenes. In the ensuing scuffle, Babu is hit in the shoulder. He takes him in his police jeep & just about to depart, Bakey sneaks in as a postman & scores the kill. The cop is furious takes him to a jungle to investigate. Babu is rescued by Bakey & takes him to his home. Fulwa removes the bullet from his body & heals him back to health. She is impressed by his suave looks & strong physique. A chemistry seems to boil among the two, which Babu also notices. Babu offers them to spend a night together, shocked at first Fulwa berates him & walks away. Bakey reluctantly backtracks saying that he was going along with their dance & booze filled merriment. Babu was actually testing their integrity & tells Bakey that if he tries getting closer to Fulwa he would kill him.After recovering from his injury Babu & Bakey collaborate to kill Triloki the last target & closest aide of Jiji. They create a chaos in the rally & abduct him from there in the guise of constables. After killing him they sit near a railway bridge to celebrate their victory. After moments of drunken banter, Bakey reveals that the contract was for 4 people & shoots Babu point blank. Babu falls off the bridge into a cargo train.Next, we see Babu waking up in a hospital with long hair & beard, apparently from a long coma (7 yrs). He clean-up himself & returns back. His cop friend reveals that after the death of Triloki, Jiji got her entire force to his location, set his house on fire, forced upon & burnt Fulwa as well. Babu is completely heartbroken & swears vengeance for the blood of all the traitors. The first locates Bakey & just as he is about to kill him, Bakey explains that he just executed his contract, principally Babu respect that. He spares his life because Bakey had saved his life in past. Bakey tells him that Dubey revealed his address to Jiji. Thereafter he goes on a killing spree & kills all his nemesis. At the end, the secretary of Dubey (who now owns his empire) gives Babu one more contract. Babu refuses & says that he has left the business. He gives him an address & tells him that he has a strong motive to take this contract.Babu goes to the address & instinctively avoids getting stabbed from a sharp tool, unmistakably from Fulwa. He is surprised to see her alive and she also has his son. Then comes Bakey. It is then revealed that Bakey & Fulwa fell in love the moment they met. Fulwa gives Bakey contract to kill Babu. Babu kills Bakey by tricking him into Russian roulette styled game. He kills Fulwa as well for her betrayal and burns both of them on pyre and keeps the child. In the end, the child shoots Babu in the end for killing Fulwa and Bakey.

[Wikipedia Plot Synopsis]
In Uttar Pradesh's political landscape, dominated by rivals Dubey and Jiji, Babu Bihari works as a hitman for both. He charges ₹20,000 per hit, giving ₹5,000 to the constable who arranges the job. Known for his ferocity and clean, straightforward kills, Babu lives simply in a remote shanty. Jiji assigns Babu to kill a local muscleman. While surveying his target, Babu meets Phulwa, a cobbler. Attracted by her beauty and strong personality, he attempts to court her but is rejected. Babu proceeds with the hit, which Phulwa witnesses.
Phulwa doesn't identify Babu to the police. He confronts her; she stabs him in self-defense. Babu learns the victim and his brothers had raped Phulwa. She promises Babu anything if he kills the remaining brothers, which he does. Upon return, Jiji is furious as Babu unknowingly ruined her political alliance plans with the brothers, souring their relationship.
Babu and Phulwa have sex. Dubey hires Babu to kill Jiji's three men. Babu informs Jiji, challenging her to protect them. During the first attempt, another hitman with the same contract, Banke (Babu's admirer), interferes. They decide to compete: whoever kills more of the three targets wins; the loser quits. Babu kills one, Banke the second. While injured, Babu is cared for by Phulwa. Babu tests Phulwa and Banke by offering them a night together, which they refuse. Babu and Banke collaborate to kill the third target, Triloki. After succeeding, they celebrate. Banke reveals there was a fourth target and shoots Babu, who falls into a passing train.
Next, we see Babu waking up in a hospital with long hair and a beard, apparently from a long coma. He cleans himself up and returns. His cop friend reveals that after the death of Triloki, Jiji got her entire force to his location, set his house on fire, killing Phulwa as well. Babu is completely heartbroken and swears vengeance for the blood of all the traitors. He first locates Banke and just as he is about to kill him, Banke explains that he just executed his contract, and principally Babu should respect that. He spares his life because Banke had saved his life in the past. Banke tells him that Dubey revealed his address to Jiji. Thereafter, he goes on a killing spree and kills all his enemies. In the end, the secretary of Dubey (who now owns his empire) gives Babu one more contract. Babu refuses and says that he has left the business. He gives him an address and tells him that he has a strong motive to take this contract.
Babu goes to the address and instinctively avoids getting stabbed with a sharp tool, unmistakably from Phulwa. He is surprised to see her alive, and she also has his son. Then comes Banke. It is then revealed that Banke and Phulwa fell in love and had sex unknowing to Babu. It was Phulwa who gave Banke the contract to kill Babu. Babu kills Banke by tricking him into a Russian roulette-styled game. He kills Phulwa as well for her betrayal and burns both of them on a pyre, and keeps the child. In the end, we see Babu raising the child after pledging to stay away from crime. One day while going through the notebook of the child, he finds that the child has drawn a picture of a family in it (mom, dad and child). While looking at the picture, his eyes suddenly widen in surprise as he sees the same child approaching him with a gun held up. In the end, a shot is heard with the words "What goes around comes around."

If we let him contest from there then victory is ours for sure. We have three other candidates who have a good image amongst the public. But before that we must deal with Jiji's henchmen. What are you doing? Don't you have work to do? Don't you have work to do? Babu, where are you? Here comes the pain in the arse. I clearly heard that. I've a problem in my arse, not my ears. I didn't come here for free booze... It's official. Mr. Dubey has joined politics. He's given you a contract for three. I told him we won't work at the old rate any more. So he's paying an extra 5000. And you get to keep all of it. Nothing for me. Happy? Not you, I need to speak to Jiji. Move aside. We need to talk in private. What is it? Dubey's given me a contract to kill three of your men. That also includes your most trusted... Triloki. You've taken a contract to kill Triloki? Jiji, you're just... I call you sister. I've known you for years, so I thought I should tell you. I think you should hide him somewhere. It will be safe for him. Do you have any shame or not? You call me your sister and you're threatening to kill one of my most trusted men. But he's not my brother-in-law, is he. If I see him roaming outside, I'll have to kill him. You'll 'have' to kill him? Let's see you do it! Jiji, I just came to tell you that... No! Let's see you kill him now. I challenge you. If you're not the son of a whore, let's see you kill him. Let's see if you really have the balls to kill him. What's wrong, Sumitra? Who are you talking to? To a fucking traitor. Traitor? So now I'm a traitor? Fine... I'm going to kill all three. But I'm going to kill your favorite one last. Yes, go ahead Ansari. That Babu had to see Jiji. Reason? Don't know. But Triloki was there. And he still is, alive. Should I talk to Yasmeen? Yes. Look... there he is. Catch him. Catch him. You've made me run! You won't be spared! How many kids does Bajarangi have, man? One of his sons is old enough to be his grandson. I wonder what he eats. His wife must be seriously screwed up. What happened? Get down. Here? Yes, get down. If you say so... Thanks for helping me out. Otherwise, people don't even ask if you need help. So is thank you enough, or should I pay in cash? Fine, I'll pay... You dare lay hands on my target I will break your arms. Do you know who I am? The name's Babu. Babu? Babu who? Babu Bihari! I am a big fan... since I was a kid. Honestly. I was only 10 years old when I got in this profession with my uncle. Since them I've been hearing stories about you and your escapades. You killed the Headman of Bhadoi. In the Kumbh fair. That was amazing. Everyone was shaken up. And also the one in the theatre... I still remember. I've killed two guys in the same way. Actually, you're my guru. Guru! I am telling the truth. I even named myself after you. Banke Bihari. Any last wishes? One autograph please. Stop-stop-stop. He's the one. Dubey sent him. So? So? Doesn't he trust me? What's the point in giving the same job to two different people. Babu, elections are around the corner. Someone must have goofed up in all this tension. In any case, whoever completes the hit gets the money. If you kill them, why will this fucker get paid? That's exactly what I was telling him. Get lost asshole. He messed up everything back there. Shat all over. He won't do anything but make things difficult for me. I think Sir's fear is something else. If I kill those three before him then he'll lose not only the money, but also his name and reputation. You'll kill them? Before me? He's my mentor. The disciple's always just two steps behind the mentor. If you're old gold. I'm the new spark! Okay son, let's play a game. Whoever kills two out of three wins gets paid for all three hits. And the one who loses quits this profession. Do you agree? Hey man... What about my commission? Who's going to pay that? Agreed. My commission. You just watch... I'll kill all three before you. My name's Banke Bihari. Ask anyone... I've a reputation in the market. Have you ever had popcorn? Yes. Do you know how it's made? No. When corn is cooked in the wok it makes a lot of noise. Do you know why? No. No? Because its arse is on fire. Babu... Hey, Babu. Quitting the business, is this a joke? I don't mean to say he will kill them first but, what if he does... When you gotta shoot, shoot, don't boost. Every gun has its own tune. It's very important. Don't worry, Yasmeen. Like I said, I'll handle all that. You just give him the measurements, okay. Yes-yes-yes... I am coming. Let me get dressed first. Mr. Shabbir is making a film. We were in a story sitting. Did you get the job done? Do you know who I met today? Guess... Babu. Babu? Babu Bihari? He's been given the contract to kill the same three men which Ansari gave you. What the fuck! What do we do now? I have a plan. Want to know? Listen. Come. This is what we'll do. <i>♪ Everyone as yet. ♪</i> <i>♪ Has only seen my figure. ♪</i> <i>♪ Everyone as yet. ♪</i> <i>♪ Has only seen my figure. ♪</i> <i>♪ And their heart is already triggered. ♪</i> <i>♪ Imagine the sight. ♪</i> <i>♪ Everyone's plight. ♪</i> <i>♪ When from my face slips away. ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil. ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil. ♪</i> <i>♪ Mesmerizes, my veil. ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil! ♪</i> <i>♪ I'll die of shame. ♪</i> <i>♪ When someone lifts my veil. ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil! ♪</i> <i>♪ With grace... ♪</i> <i>♪ Like a crime it is to move with grace. ♪</i> <i>♪ Everyone reads the signals broadcasted by my waist. ♪</i> <i>♪ When I glance in sly, give them a look as a reply. ♪</i> <i>♪ Everyone's heart stops. ♪</i> <i>♪ Imagine the sight. ♪</i> <i>♪ Everyone's plight. ♪</i> <i>♪ When from my face slips away. ♪</i> <i>♪ My veil! ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil. ♪</i> <i>♪ Mesmerizes, my veil. ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil! ♪</i> <i>♪ I'll die of shame... ♪</i> <i>♪ When someone lifts my veil. ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil! ♪</i> <i>♪ Oh my... ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil! ♪</i> <i>♪ O my veil! ♪</i> <i>♪ When someone lifts my veil. ♪</i> <i>♪ My veil... ♪</i> <i>♪ My veil... ♪</i> <i>♪ My veil... ♪</i> <i>♪ My veil... ♪</i> Don't be scared, sir. I wouldn't have waited so long if I wanted to kill you. So do you give up? Not yet. The game's just begun. Then? I am here to recover 2500 rupees from you. I fired 10 rounds because of you. Each bullet costs 250 rupees, you know. Is that all? How many did you kill? Three. I would've recovered 60,000 instead of 2500. I never kill for free. You get 20 to kill a guy? 25. 5 that fatso takes away... Bhupati. What the fuck! Commission. 25000 to kill one person. No one's even prepared to pay me 12,000. They agreed to pay me 10 after a lot of haggling. Otherwise they pay me just 8000 which they've been paying for the last five years. Tell me, how much has inflation' gone up in 5 years? Inflation goes up every year. 25,000 rupees and Bhupati takes 5000 from that. Here. The booze is free. Have it. 5000? Otherwise if you have to pay for it, you'll say it's expensive. Fucked... My life's fucked... You... If your life's fucked, what's all the attitude about? That was my first job. I got paid 2000 for it. Later, when I got a bit famous. It got raised to 5000. Five years went at the same rate. Finally now I'm paid 8000. How much did you get for your first job? Two bananas. Two bananas! What the fuck! I maybe crazy, but not insane. Who kills someone for two bananas? A 10 year old kid, who hasn't eaten for four days... Can kill the whole fucking world for two bananas. 10 year old? So you... you actually shot someone at the age of 10? No-no I killed him with a stone. I learnt how to shoot a gun in jail. Respect sir. I salute you. I want to touch your feet. I need your blessings. I salute. Don't even think of dying before the game is over sir. If you die, who will I defeat? Don't worry, son. I will defeat you by 3-0. Remember. How much? 1 quintal. Mughlai Darbaar. 1 quintal Mughlai Darbaar. How much? 25 quintal 32 quintal. Murtuza Kabab Corner. Hey... 32... Murtuza Kabab Corner I've got the stuff as well. Aye careful with that!! Aye careful with that!! Make sure they take the bullet out. Stop it... as soon as I get home... Mom, dad's back home. As soon as I get home, you guys lose it. I shot you. Now die! Oh hell... What? Get lost. Run away. Catch. Bloody... Oh God... You call these 'kids'? Since when have I produced them myself? It's all thanks to you. Give me the water. Here. Let me tell you clearly... If it's a girl this time, then fine. Otherwise I'm getting myself operated. No more kids. Ya... ya... go get it done. Who is it? Asshole calling. Get lost! Hail India sir. Yes, sir. You... Wait, you... No, it's nothing sir. I'll be there, sir. Okay sir. Tarashankar Chauhan is your name? Do you know Babu? Babu Bihari. The same guy who killed Bajrangi. Oh yes... But Babu... why will he kill your men? He's like family to you. Was. Now he licks Dubey's balls. Bastard came and told me himself. Dubey's given him a contract to kill three of our men. The first was Bajrangi. When's your turn? Second or third? Third! What? Did I crack a joke? No... I... I was just wondering that all this time you raised him so well to screw others but never imagined that he'll screw you back instead. Sorry. Madam, it's the laundryman. No need for any grand arrangements. Just keep it low... Yes, I know. But just do as I tell you. Just get 2, 4... Stop... So... Babu Bihari. How are things? Well... I'm still alive. Not for long. Nothing in life comes with a guarantee. But one thing's for sure... I'm not getting bumped off at the hands of a bloody policeman. Yes, Meena. We're out of onions and potatoes. Yeah... You'll need to get some. I will. You always inform after we run out of them. Do you need anything else? I'll call if I need anything else. Okay. What? What? Nothing. Let's go. You seem to be in a hurry. Really? Game over! What happened? Oh God! Want some? Is it local brew or malt? Malt. Yeah I'll have malt. There you go... It's really tasty. Drinking policeman's booze is a completely different experience. Isn't it? Why you... Motherfucker... Bastard... Tell me Babu, who was your partner? Tell me... Come on come on... tell me... who was it... He wasn't my partner. Then who was it? He's my fan. You motherfucker... Bastard! Let go! Yes, Meena... The house is infested with mosquitoes and we're fresh out of mosquito coils. If I make it back home, I will. What's all that noise? Is it gunfire? No dear... they're just firecrackers. I had a tough time with the mosquitoes last night. Do you understand? Don't forget to get them. Bloody... Why did you save me? Why didn't you tell that cop about me? I am an asshole. Well, I am a bigger asshole! Ticket. Ticket. Ticket. Come, I'll show you. Where are you taking me? What's this? Take a look. I don't want it. No-no... Take a look. No... Look carefully. I said I don't want it. Listen... You don't want to see the ticket? Do you know what one ghost said to the other - What? I hardly see you these days. Do you know what one wall said to the other? Meet me in the corner. It's nothing, I'm still alive. Why did you come back alive? You should've come in a body-bag. It would've been better than showing up like this. Banke. Ya? Let's die and come back in body bags. Where the fuck are you going?! Look at yourself... You can't even walk. <i>I'm still alive.</i> I really owe you for this. Lie down. It's nothing, I'm absolutely fine. What fine... just lie down quietly! <i>♪ O sweetheart... buy me a pair of sunglasses. ♪</i> <i>♪ Because I'm not getting my youth back. ♪</i> And what are you? Banke. Banke Bihari. I saved his life. How can you be so stupid? Why did you bring him back here like this? Couldn't you have taken him to a hospital instead? Back in the city, the doctor checks the patient later and calls the police first. So what are you carrying this for? To show off? You should've put this on the doctor's head! His threat to call the police would come out of his arse like a fart. I told him to bring me here. Oh ya? Because there's a doctor at your disposal here? Look at that wound. It's turned blue. Dr. Phulwa? What are you doing? I am going to severe your arm. What's it to you? Then how am I going to clean my arse after I shit? Don't move... lie still. Who's he? Claims to be my disciple but actually wants to take my place. He has a nice body. Why don't you let him work with you? He'll be of help. Is his body better than mine? Yours? Ya, mine. His body's better than yours for sure. My body's like Bruce Lee's. Do you want to see it? I do... Show me. Yes. Show me. Should I? What? Hello. It's me. Where the hell were you? Do you know how many times I tried calling you? My battery was dead. I just charged it. Listen, I am stuck here for a job. I'll be back in a day or two. Okay? Girlfriend? What can I say? It's okay to have one. Okay. She works in the movies. She's an actress? Wow! You're lucky. How is she? A real back-breaker. Better than mine? Naah... Yours is different. She's amazing. Really amazing. She's amazing? Where's your drink? He's one of us. Go get yours. See... Cheers! You know, she sings really well. No no... he's lying. I'm not. A peg or two down... And she'll be crooning like Lata Mangeshkar. And after three. She's Madhuri Dikshit. The "Ek Don Teen" song.

Jiji, keep fighting... We are with you. Come on... Let's go. Buzz off. Run! Is everything okay here? Where's Triloki? My brother left with the constables. Which constables?! What the fuck?! They got him. What are you blabbering? They took him! What we thought was a blast, were just firecrackers. You motherfucker! Are you here on duty or to see your mother do a striptease? If anything happens to him I'll make you'll regret you were even born. Asshole. Hello, Triloki. You're so much in demand. Now see, he wants to kill you, and so do I. Unbelievable. Banke... Banke Bihari. I'm the one who killed Sahay. Enough with the introduction. I am telling him because this is the first time we've met. Look Triloki, this is our job. Our bread and butter. Don't take it personally. We cannot betray our profession. We'll have to kill you. Now it's up to you to choose, at whose hands you wish to die. His or mine. The choice is yours. What are you saying? What? I abducted him, so I get to kill him. Did you do it alone? And it's his choice, who he feels should kill him. But I bought these police uniforms. So what? The plan was mine. Doesn't matter who made the plan. Who parked the cycle there? It was me. Cycle... I set the fuse... Sir this is wrong. I didn't know you'll make such an issue of this. Otherwise, I would've never come with you. Did I beg and give you a hand job to come help me? To hell with your game, I don't want to play any game. This is cheating. Out and out cheating. Do you want to cheat and win the game? Fine, kill him. You know what... Let's do... What is it called? What? Tea-breaker... what... Toss? No... What's it called? Tea break... Tie-breaker. Right, tie-breaker! Your English is good. Fine. I'll shoot first. What the... Fine, go ahead you shoot first. Okay. Triloki... bye bye. Banke... Stop this! You're ruining my reputation here. You... Bloody... Banke... use your legs. Your legs... catch him with your legs! Banke... use your legs. Bravo. Bravo! Banke! You bastard, I won't spare you. You've lost your chance. Get lost. Your chance is over. Your chance is over. You can kill him if you want but I am going to first bust both his knees and then his balls. And then you can kill him. What the fuck... Kill me if you want, just end this here. Fine, fine we're going to kill you. It takes time. Let's shoot him together. Wait... who will win the game? Neither you nor me. It'll be a tie. On three then, okay? One... two... At least let me finish counting. No, Babu. One... No, Babu. Two... Three. Look son, I did you a big favor by letting you stay in this profession. But don't forget... A mentor is always a mentor. Don't ever try to cross my path. But you will have quit this profession, sir. Because I won the game. Bastard! What do you mean I won the game... I won the game... You got 1½ and so did I. It's a tie. But the contract wasn't for three. It was for four. 2½. I won. <i>2½... I win.</i> Ticket. Ticket. I'll show you. Cigarette? Where's the bus depot? You'll see Dubey Square after four blocks. Turn left from there. It's right there. Duby Chowk? When did that get built? You're new here? When Dubey won his first election. That was seven years ago. Seven years?! Put it on my tab. Fuck! You're still alive! Where the fuck were you? Arm-wrestling with death. It took death seven years to realize I wasn't going to be an easy prey. Eight years... It's been eight years since you died. How much is it? Whatever it is, it's all I have. Anyway... It's better than going home empty handed. Is the bullet still inside? I don't know... But it feels like it. No non-veg? It's been 5 years. She stopped making it. I stopped eating it. Pappu wouldn't eat if there was no non-veg. Oh yes... Where is he? I don't see him. He must have grown up now. He died. Five years ago. There was an outbreak of Dengue. Look at the irony of it. I didn't get it, he didn't get it and my son got it. Like they say... Man forgets the evil he does... But karma doesn't... it catches up with him one day. I guess you two kept meeting, didn't you? How is Phulwa? I said how is she? Bloody bastards. They even took the door. Who did this? It happened after you killed Triloki. God knows how Jiji found your home. And that bastard Triveni... He brought his gang with him. Run from there, from there, asshole! <i>They set your home on fire right in front of my eyes.</i> <i>I was scared shit.</i> <i>I just kept staring from afar.</i> Couldn't do anything. And Phulwa? <i>♪ Void they are... ♪</i> <i>♪ My nights, of dreams. ♪</i> <i>♪ Dark they are... ♪</i> <i>♪ My days, too are dark. ♪</i> <i>♪ Thorny it is... ♪</i> <i>♪ My bed, as I toss and turn. ♪</i> <i>♪ Every move hurts. ♪</i> <i>♪ Thorns prickle as I toss and turn. ♪</i> <i>♪ Every move hurts. ♪</i> <i>♪ Weeps and wails, nights in pain. ♪</i> <i>♪ Dark they are... ♪</i> <i>♪ When I saw the mirror of time... ♪</i> <i>♪ I saw someone else. ♪</i> <i>♪ I got scared of myself. ♪</i> <i>♪ For I learnt that I am dead. ♪</i> <i>♪ I breathe... ♪</i> <i>♪ I survive... ♪</i> <i>♪ The heart beats... ♪</i> <i>♪ I carry upon my shoulders my own dead body. ♪</i> <i>♪ Dark they are... ♪</i> <i>♪ My days, too are dark. ♪</i> I've quoted three hundred thousand! It's a big job. He'll pay at least a hundred thousand each. Do you really need all that lipstick? Your lips are naturally so red. Which one? Both. You motherfucker! I'm leaving... Come here. I'll tell you a secret... Come... You want a massage? Here, hold this. Guys, what happened? Come here... Come... Don't do that, sir. Don't kill me. I made a mistake, please forgive me. Mistake... Your mistake was that you couldn't kill me. I didn't want to kill you, but what could I do? I was given your contract. I couldn't have betrayed my profession. What would you have done? Hadn't you said exactly the same thing when we killed Triloki? That you can't betray your profession. I don't have any personal enmity with you. I saved your life. Please spare my life for old time's sake. Spare my life. I beg you... I beg you! They killed Phulwa. Burnt her alive. You spat out everything in front of them. Like a wimp. Motherfucker why did you tell them where I lived? Why would I tell them where you lived? What did I stand to gain from it? You fucker, then who told them. Who gained from this? Who gained from all this? He did... he gave them your whereabouts. He gained from it. He's the one... He gave me the contract to kill you. Dubey? You saved my life once. So I'm sparing yours. But the next time you cross my path... I won't give you the time to speak nor myself the time to listen. If you're thinking about killing those rascals then forget about it. I will do it for you. I mean... I've got a contract. I swear... Sir! How about we play another game? For old times sake... If you kill two out of three I won't just quit this profession, but this city as well. And if I win... then you must quit both. Say something... Sir...! Stop. You're still here? I was thinking about Babu. Should I stay back tonight if you're scared? I'm not scared. Are you? <i>He's stubborn and he's mad.</i> <i>He's standing erect in the storm with a lamp.</i> That's brilliant. Standing erect... With a lamp. This is great. Wonderful. Come come Jiji... You must hear what this boy's written. <i>Fire burns...</i> Listen, my stomach is growling... I need to use the toilet. Of course... go ahead. Do come back again. My wife just loves poems like these. You must recite this one for here. Where's the mug that used to be here? I had a nozzle installed, use that. You'll love the feel of the water gushing. Give him your number. Go and flush. Are you okay? There's no news of Triveni since morning. I'm really worried. I... saw Babu yesterday at the function. Babu? Babu Bihari. No wonder you have loose motions. Come on now... Babu's dead. Are you sure you didn't see a ghost? Triveni's body has been found... burnt. Babu! 1-0! So, 100,000's gone. Gopal, Murli... Papa's come... What's going on, huh! What are you all up to... Papa... Papa, sweetmeat... Enough... enough... Papa, sweetmeat... Enough! Enough! Quiet. Take the sweetmeats, come on now... go off. You guys drive me crazy. Where's your mother? Inside. Meena... Meena! I bought your favorite... 'Rabadi' and 'Jalebi' (Indian Sweets). Take it. I met my aunt this morning. She said my face has turned pale. And even this time it's going to be a boy. Fuck your aunt. Who does she think she is? What she says doesn't matter! But still... Bloody nonsense! If it's a boy again, I'll shoot... Your aunt. <i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i> <i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i> <i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i> Sumitra ma'am. Hello... Today's my lucky day... tell me... I have a solution. Till Babu isn't arrested we'll go underground, in hiding. Doesn't matter where you hide, he will find you. There's one place. No one can ever imagine will be a hideout. Where? Jobanpura. Have you lost your mind? That's the red light area. So what? In fact you'll feel at home there. Safe. That must have been your mother's home. I won't go to that brothel. Oh, and... You are scheduled to visit the Naxalite (Extremists) area. Oh yes... that's important. You cannot cancel that. And if Babu shows up, gun down the bastard. Do you think I'm an asshole? You want me to go there alone to die? I'll be with you. What will he do? You think he can kill you with me around? We'll go with security. Security... How the fuck will security stop him? Forget it, Dubey sir. She's scared shit. She's a woman after all. The best place for her is Jobanpura. Babu really won't need to try hard if you stick your head out like a sitting duck... Roll up the window! Don't step out. Don't step out! What happened? Who is it... who's shooting at them? Is it Babu? - No I'm talking to you who was it? Shut up! Bloody motherfucker. What happened to your security now? Shoved it up your arse? Big talk... that's all you do. Now why did you run off? Bloody scoundrel. Shut up. Shut up or else I'll smash your face. What did you say? What did you say? You'll smash my face? Motherfucker... Will smash my face! Bloody fucker! Asshole! Stop it... stop this shit! How dare you? How dare you? You have a death wish? Get out!! Hit me. Come on hit me! Hit me!! Now my turn. If I knew, I would've beaten the life out of you. Really! Haven't you beaten me enough already? Tell me something... What do you put in your betel leaf? It smells so nice. Oh, my... What happened? Run, Sumitra. Run... For my sake. I won't leave you. Sumitra, run. Run! Come. Come, Jiji. Come. See what a scoundrel Dubey is. He betrayed you the same way he betrayed me. Sheer betrayal. He took advantage of the situation, killed one of your men. And then targeted you. No one can save him once I get my hands on him. But where is he? Hiding between his mother's legs? He's got an entire battalion protecting him. You won't be able to get to him. Me? Ha! Jobanpura. He's hiding in Jobanpura. Babu... Babu... Babu, I beg you. Kill me if you want, but not like this. Babu. Babu, you're like my brother. Babu, you call me your sister, don't you. Babu, shoot me! But don't leave me here. Babu, you motherfucker! You bloody bastard! Kill me. Babu, don't leave me here. Sumitra. Sumitra. Where in hell are you? What happened to you? He shot me. Who? Me. And who brought him here? I did. What if the fucker had died? There should be someone who carries my name forward. What? Nothing. One's an asshole. The other one's a bigger asshole. Great. I need a drink. Is he going to marry you? Marry me? Why? Will you? Who's Phulwa? Why? You were repeatedly taking her name. So I asked. How long have you known Banke? Since I was 12. He lived in my neighborhood. Did his first job for me. For free... all I had to do was ask. But he told me he got 2000 for his first job. Bloody liar. Who did you ask him to kill? Me? My father's brother. <i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i> <i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i> <i>♪ Please take it. ♪</i> Yes... Huh... is it paining a lot? Listen Gopal... you have the doctor's number, don't you? Yes... call her. Yes, yes, the same one... And call your mother's aunt. Call her. And listen... Listen, son. I won't be able to come home soon so take care of your mother and let me know. I'll try to get home really soon. Yes, take care. No-no, Sir... Not that one! That one's my favorite. Take any other. Here, shove it up your arse. Why are you taking such a big risk? The fucker will come out of hiding someday. We'll kill him them. I'll go into his hideout and shoot him. You don't have the balls go get your arse stitched. You've already lost the game. It's 2-0. Now it will be 3-0... whitewash! Where is he? On the phone with his wife. Yes... more-more... More. Fucking over the phone! Unbelievable! More. Mr. Dubey. Mr. Dubey. That was my wife on the line. I was telling her about Jiji. I want to tell you something too. Babu wasn't alone. Banke was with him. Banke? What was he doing there? That's exactly what I want to know. What was he doing there? He's one of your men, isn't he? Hell will break loose today. Yes Meena. God has finally answered your prayers. It's a girl. Really? Did you hear her? Who does she look like? I mean... how does she look? She looks just like you. What? Really? I have a daughter. God bless her. See Ansari, that's Osama Bin Laden. Who was made by America and later, he turned around and screwed America. Our story's quite the same... But with a different end. Here, Osama's going to fuck America. And get away with it. I admit I made a mistake. I... I shouldn't have told Jiji where you lived. But what could I do? She insisted. She wanted to avenge Triloki's death. At first, I refused to tell her anything. It was only after I heard you were dead, Babu... that I told her... Doesn't matter whether you told her before or after. Phulwa's died. Phulwa?! You gave a contract for me... fine. But why Phulwa? Phulwa was... This one's for Phulwa. You shouldn't have done that. What was her fault? You got her killed. That's enough, now get out. What are you looking at? He's the one who gave me the contract... for these three. Why did you kill Phulwa? You won't get paid for this one. Babu killed him. Have you lost your mind? I shot him first. Or I'll shoot you as well. I've risked my life to do your job. Okay listen, I am going home. I have spoken to Ansari. You'll get the money within a week. A week? Does it take a week to pay a hundred thousand? Three hundred thousand. I've told him to pay the entire amount. But will he pay three hundred thousand? Of course the fucker will pay. The job was worth that much. Yes, but... I'm coming back on Sunday. Let's talk then. Fine. A hundred thousand. What do you say? Your offer's tempting. But I've decided to quit. You'll change your mind when you hear the name. Banke. Do you think I'm like Banke? I won't make the same fucking mistake he made. Whether you offer me a hundred thousand or a million. I won't kill Banke. You will. You'll definitely kill Banke. Why did you lie to me? You took all my savings. I thought this way I could make some quick money. I asked him for 50... I thought he'll bargain, but he gave me 55 instead. You look so different. Look at you all dressed up... Like a complete woman. Nice home too. Bed. Fresh paint. Everything neatly arranged. Remember, when we had gone to the market once... shopping? Remember? There, a store had had a scheme exchange old for new. You remember don't you. That's exactly what you did with me. When you are bored with him... Will you exchange him too? I love her. Didn't I love her? I loved her the way I knew to love. And you had me killed. Look, papa. You were out playing marbles again! Go wash yourself you're a mess! I'll throw all your marbles. So many marbles. Did you win them all? Ya? Yes. Then you must have a good aim. I did too. Which one should I hit? This one? See... I taught these two. Didn't you hear what I said? Go wash yourself! If you had me killed you should've aborted my child as well. You took away everything from me. Why did you do this to me? Phulwa, where are you? What happened yesterday can never happen again. It's not right. I'm leaving. I'll be back when the job's done. Where's the asshole? When do I see you next? I don't know when I'll get the chance. And what do we do till then? If you love me, let's run away. Are you crazy? He'll find us and kill us. Even our bodies won't be found. No worries, anything for you. Where the hell are you? Listen... if I give you a contract to kill someone... Will you do it? Can you do it? How did he find our house? Must have been your girlfriend who told him. Again the same shit? Why are you dragging her into this? You can't let go of her, can you? I told you to kill him. Can't do a single job right. I shot him in the head. He survived. What more was I supposed to do? Shoot him again. Shoot him again! I shot him once and couldn't sleep peacefully for 8 years. How could I shoot him again? Now he'll put you to sleep forever. And me too. Come... Does he go to school? We've got him admitted but he's not keen on studying. Plays marbles all day. What's his name? Abhishek. Abhishek. (Indian actor) We were thinking of naming him Hrithik. (Indian actor) But Abhishek is her favorite and mine too. So we named him Abhishek. Abhishek is your favorite? What are you saying? I never knew. Did you ever have the time to know? Here. Take him inside. We need to talk. Whatever it is, say it in front of me. Don't be stubborn. Take him inside. I said say what you have to say in front of me! I'm going to shoot him. Should I shoot him in front of you? Let's play one last game. Load a bullet and shuffle the chamber. Let's see who destiny favors. Whoever wins lives, and whoever dies is the loser. Do you agree? What kind of game is this? Agree! But this time if you die your blood won't be on my hands. I forgive you my death. You have my word. On three then... One... Two... Three...! Really, sir? You know, you learnt to do everything the way I did learnt everything but this this trick of shuffling chambers. You could never learn it, could you? The bullet should come back to the same place. Like this. Understood? No worries anything for you... Mama!
