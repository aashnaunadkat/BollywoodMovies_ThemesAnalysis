Romesh (Arjun Mathur) was a young medical intern who dared to dream. He was in awe of Dr. Asthana (Kay Kay Menon), the Chief of Surgery of the Shekhawat General Hospital. All he wanted was to be like him. He lived with Dr Riya (Vishakha Singh), his co-intern and the love of his life.
All high profile cases of the city are brought to Asthana and his skill in the operating theater is legendary. Asthana knows that he is the best general surgeon of the country and has a touch of arrogance about him. Asthana berates Romesh for even minor mistakes or hesitation inside the Operating Theater.
Shekhawat Awasthi (Harsh Chhaya) is the owner of the hospital, who gets funds in Asthana's name.However, when an eight-year-old boy, Ankur (Vishesh Tiwari) dies due to Dr. Asthana's medical negligence, Romesh realizes that a good surgeon is not necessarily a good person. Ankur was brought with abdominal pain which Romesh diagnoses as appendicitis. Romesh is confident that Ankur can be operated upon in 1 day and sent on his way, but Asthana makes Ankur stay in hospital for 2 extra days, citing that OT is not available (while it was). He chides Romesh that hospital is a business as well.Ankur came to the hospital with his mother Nandita. Nandita is a single mother after her husband abandoned her. Nandita works for Ajay Shetty (Sachin Khurana), who is also her friend. Nandita feels bad as Ankur had been complaining of stomach pain for a few hours, but she thought that Ankur was making an excuse to skip school.Asthana orders a battery of tests on Ankur to confirm Romesh's diagnosis. Romesh is also angry at Riya for not standing up to Asthana. Riya says that there is no point in fighting a battle that they cannot win and advises Romesh to let the matter go.Nandita is given a list of surgical items to purchase. Ankur was alone in the room when Nandita went to the pharmacy. During that brief period, Ankur ate something, even though he was under strict instructions to be empty stomach for the surgery.On the day of the operation Ankur tells the nurse Rosina (Khushboo Kamal) that he had some biscuits. Rosina informs Asthana, but Asthana ignores her concerns and decides to go ahead with the operation. Asthana argues that there is a huge list of operations scheduled and hence he cannot delay the surgery and promises to clean up Ankur's stomach before the surgery.Asthana forgets to clean up Ankur's stomach prior to the operation as he was distracted when Rosina was talking to him and was talking to someone on the phone.
The operation goes off, but just afterwards Ankur starts vomiting & shortly thereafter goes into coma by suffocating in his own vomit. Asthana admits his mistake in front of the operating theatre staff but threatens their careers if they don't cooperate with him. Asthana asks Riya to inform Ankur's family.
Riya tells Nandita that during surgery Ankur's lungs collapsed and he had to be put on a ventilator as he went into coma.Romesh finds Riya crying alone and tries to comfort her, but she doesn't say anything. Romesh then finds that Ankur had slipped into coma during surgery.Asthana then changes nurse Rosina's report to say that Ankur had food 9 hours before the surgery, by turning her 1 into a 9. Asthana says that he is only trying to protect the reputation of the hospital. He pays Rosina money to keep her mouth shut and leave town.
Romesh goes into Ankur's room when he is alone and finds traces of vomit in Ankur's hair. Romesh starts suspecting foul play but can't find Rosina to cross check his hypothesis. Romesh confronts Riya, who breaks down, but doesn't admit anything. Romesh questions Riya that if Ankur's lung collapsed, he should have been given Bronchoscopy and not antibiotics. Romesh yells at Riya to admit that Ankur vomited during surgery, but she sticks to the official story.Romesh begs Asthana to admit his guilt in private to Ankur's mother. Asthana promises to destroy Romesh's career. Riya refuses to cooperate with Romesh's crusade for truth.
Romesh goes alone to Ankur's mother & admits the truth. She decides to hire a lawyer & sue the hospital.
Together with Ankur's mother Nandita (Tisca Chopra), and lawyer Kajori (Paoli Dam), Dr Romesh sets out on a turbulent journey to fight for what is right.It turns out that Nandita's lawyer Kajori is the mistress of Asthana's lawyer & both intend to milk this situation to the fullest to further their own careers and bank balances. Kajori falls pregnant during the trial and Asthana's lawyer Rajiv Mallani (Manish Choudhary) advises abortion.Romesh is perplexed that Kajori is not attacking Asthana directly during her statements in court. She is trying to prove hospital's negligence. Romesh spots them together, and with Nandita, he goes to her house, only to find her lying ill due to the abortion pill. They take her to the hospital and save her life, and Kajori promises them that she will fight for Ankur.It turns out that all the necessary evidence against Dr. Viren Asthana is destroyed or literally snatched. Dr. Riya, who witnesses the operation, and Rosina D'Costa (Khushboo Kamal), a ward nurse in the hospital who had informed Dr. Asthana about Ankur eating some biscuits before the operation, also lie in court.The next day Riya goes to Dr. Viren Asthana to sign for leave. She tells him that she lied and cheated with the credibility of her profession, and her self-respect is questioning her. A heated argument between her and Dr. Asthana follows in which Dr. Asthana labels himself as the god who should be forgiven for the mistake he has done.It is revealed in the hospital the next day that Riya had actually shot the confession outburst by Dr. Viren Asthana on her mobile and presented it to the court. The case ends in their favor, and Dr. Viren Asthana gets arrested. In the last scene, Romesh and Riya reunite, and Nandita is shown remembering her memories with Ankur.

Before becoming a doctor we've to take a pledge. It's called Hippocratic oath. Some oaths, like we'll always take the side of truth" ...we'll respect every life as precious. ...we'll give more importance to patients than ourselves. It's easy to take pledge.. ...but it's very difficult to fulfill it. And our story starts at the same crossroad. Dr. Asthana was a famous general surgeon of the country. People call his God of surgery. And I considered him my mentor. And to learn surgery from him.. ...I was doing internship in Shekhavat General hospital. Sir, who is this patient? Entire media has ﬂocked to get his news. - He's Mr. Laxman Gagal. Gagal? One of the top business tycoon? Yes. But what has happened? Accident. What the hell is happening here? This is not a goddamn circus. Get ward to patch up. Dr. Riya. Yes, sir. You'll be with the patient, Dr. Romesh. Sir. Hi, doctor. My name is Amit Gagal. That's my father. Amit Gagal. 3 things. Keep your family away from me. Don't ask about the patient's condition again and again. ...I'll get irritated. And finally, nobody besides me can save your father. Is that clear? Out. Sir.

We're losing him. Come on. What are you thinking? Jab it now. Come on. Jab... Who let you in the operation theater? Give it to me. .. .Get out Ohh.. GOD <i>,</i> his BP has gone down to 55. Atropine - 1 ampule. His BP is going down, doctor. Atropine 1 ampule <i>,</i> nurse. Come on, quick sister. Heart rate is down to 20, sir. Pulse is down. Doctor.. Bradycardia Nurse... defibrillator. Charge to 200. Charged. Clear. Sir. Sir. Hold on. Mr. Gagal had multiple rib fractures and ruptured spleen. Operation was successful. He's in ICU right now.. ...under observation. He'll recover soon. Thank you. But when will he be able to lead normal.. Sir. I'm very sorry for whatever happened today in OT. Stay with Mr. Gagal in ICU. If there is any emergency press the code blue button. Yes, sir. You couldn't give an injection. I hope you'll be able to press the button. Sir, I'm.. Hey, you.. You didn't sleep yet? It's 6.30 in the morning. It's 11 in Sydney. It's a live match. How can I sleep? How did you get interested in cricket suddenly? Some cute new cricketer? Just you . Ok... still now. I know you're upset that I'm upset but.. But what Asthana said was true. I did freeze. What had happened to me? Sshh.. It's ok .. happens ...this was your first surgery. And.. ...In such a situation even the best of best shiver. That's why we're interns.. ...so that we can face such a situation. Anyway, it isn't easy to inject in someone's lungs.. ...especially if he's such a big celebrity. It means I'm a good person and a bad doctor. Only a good person can become a good doctor. By the way, good person, good doctor.. ...become a good lover too. "Slowly and slowly.." "..let this heart pine." "Slowly and slowly.." "..let the aroma dwell in the breath." "Express all the feelings of heart today." "Let our dreams ﬂy with the breeze." "Let's enjoy life a little."

Tell me. Dad, I'll call you back. I can't hear you. What are you doing? Dad was on the line. He doesn't know we stay together. I'm from a small town, not a foreigner. Fine, but where did you hide my underwear. It's here.. "When we're face to face..“ "..our eyes get locked." "Just like me.." "..your eyes too look for me." "I am restless because of you." "Your prayers are for me." "Let's enjoy life a little." "Sacrifice this world for love." "Relish this moment." "Sacrifice this world for love." This man needs no introduction. He's an important for us as Sachin is for Cricket. If not for Dr. Asthana.. ...we wouldn't have got funds for our children's ward. Now I want Dr. Asthana to say a few words. What can I say? He made me Tendulkar. He's also equally important for our hospital. "As much as BCCI for our Indian cricket team. We can neither stay with them.. ...nor without them. Yes. Hello. Hi, doctor. ..Doctor this is my son - Ankur. He is having terrible stomach-ache since last night. Don't know, what's it? Come here, son. Come. Sit. Did he vomit? No. He said he feels like vomiting" "but he didn't. I've given him a pain killer, but it was of no use. Okay- Missus.. - Nandita. You can call me Nandita. Nandita, I can't be sure just now.. ...but it could be appendicitis. I think it might be better if you.. ...let him stay here for the night. How can he get appendicitis suddenly? I mean.. - No, no, no. It's not a serious situation. It's a very common problem. Actually appendix is such a part of our body.. ...without which you can easily function. Just like tonsils. We call them vestigial organs. Like a tail. Yeah, like a tail. The problem is that for confirmation.. ...we need to do sonography.. ...and it can be done only tomorrow morning. - So I think.. ...It will be better if you keep him here tonight because.. ...If he gets pain in the night at home.. ...It will just get difficult. Yeah. Fine. Then I'll get him admitted. Okay, very good. Don't be scared. Excuse me. - Yes, sir. - In which room is Ankur Arora ? On the second ﬂoor. Room number 201. - Thank you. Welcome. What are you doing here? The question is what are you doing here? What the hell is happening? And what happened to Ankur suddenly? Doctor thinks its appendicitis. He told me to get him admitted so that.. ...there won't be any complication“. ...so I got him admitted. You did good. But you should have phoned me. I would have come with you. It was already very late. I didn't want to bother you. Now you're being really formal. You're not just my employee, but my friend too. You should have phoned me. You know I'm always there for you. Sit. Sandwich. I don't feel like eating. Look, eat it. Or else you'll get acidity and all that nonsense. Even the mother will have to be admitted with the son. He was telling me since morning that he has stomach-ache. I thought he was making an excuse to avoid going to school. I was so stupid. Ankur. I thought you were lying. I'm so sorry. You kept telling me the whole day but I didn't understand. It must've hurt a lot. Didn't it? Momma is so stupid. Mom, don't worry. I'm okay. It doesn't pain now. I'm fine, mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. So sorry. Who is the next patient? Ankur Arora. Good morning, doctor. My name is Nandita Arora and.. Who admitted him? I did, sir. Patient was in pain and complaining of nausea. I had doubt that it must be appendicitis so.. ...I thought it better to admit. Was sonography performed? No, sir. How do you know it's appendicitis? It could be uretic stones? Sir, complain was of stomach-ache. It could be lntussusception. Sir, there was no complain of blood in.. ...the stool and the pain wasn't so much. Viral gastroenteritis. Sir, there was neither fever nor diarrhea. Diagnose is right. The decision to admit is right too. Get a CT scan. You'll know how much the infection is. Yes, sir. Are you his mother? This appendicitis shouldn't be ignored for long. It's not good. We may have to perform operation on getting the scan report. Today OT is not vacant, so we'll perform operation tomorrow. As the pain is less, there is no problem. As you say. Sir, actually OT is available today. - Today OT isn't available. No, sir. The gall bladder surgery was canceled. Today OT isn't available. Operation will be performed tomorrow. Don't you do that to me ever again. Don't interrupt me again in front of my patient. Sir, it was just.. When I say OT isn't available, then OT isn't available. Sir, I was told that surgery is canceled.. ...so I thought of informing you. Doctor. Romesh. I know the surgery was canceled. I know OT is available. But the child will stay here tonight. Do you know why? Because I say so. If you want to become a successful doctor, remember.. ...this is a profession <i>as</i> well <i>as</i> business. Treatment takes medicine. Modern machines, medicines and staff are not for free. One has to pay money for them. Hospital runs on money, not just on virtues. No money, no hospital. And no hospital, no treatment. If you sympathize so much with her, tell her.. ...not to go to expensive beauty parlor for a month. She'll save the money. If she can't do this much for her son, why should we? Money from one patient will be used for other. They very well pay for each other. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Do you understand, doctor" Romesh? I'm asking you, Dr. Romesh. Do you understand? Sir, we understand. We all understand. We understand what you're saying. Try to understand. Learn from her. Take it easy. Hey, champ. You okay in there? Yeah. Okay. I'm not scared. Good. Can I ask a question? Sure. Do people die during operation of Assendipitis? It's Appendicitis, not Assendipitis. Nobody dies in this operation, only lives are saved. And we won't let you die. Are you sure? Very sure. Very sure. Is it only appendicitis or some other complication? Only appendicitis. But if you and Dr. Asthana want.. ...we can perform a dozen more tests. You've to run this hospital's business. Romesh, I was just. You understand everything. I'm getting bored. For how long should I keep lying? 10 more minutes, champ. Can I tell you something? But please don't tell mom. Sure. I'm expert in keeping secrets. Actually, I don't feel good as I'm sick. Because mom is sad because of me. She was already sad. And she got sadder. Don't worry. It will be fine. She thinks I don't know anything" ...I'm a kid. But I'm not a kid. I know dad has left us for ever. I also know.. "That mom doesn't cry in front of me. She cries alone in her bedroom. Please cure me. I'll grow up and earn lots of money.. ...only for mom. I'll buy lots of presents for her. I'll always keep her happy. I promise not to leave her alone. Romesh, it's not fair. You're venting out Asthana's anger on me. I was just trying to ease the tension. ...between you and Dr. Asthana that's all. It was really getting out of control. Riya, you know, when I was small.. ...my mother used to tell me.. ...when a person loses courage.. ...his wisdom increases. And when I was small my mother too said.. ...It's better to be quiet then fight for no reason. Fight only when you can. Not when you're powerless. Your Dr. Asthana won't let me in OT.. ...tomorrow for Ankur's operation. Take care of the kid. And now will you end your vow of silence. I love you. That's the problem. I love you too. Mom. I'm hungry. You can't eat now, Ankur. Your operation is in an hour, son. Come on. Be a brave boy. You can eat later. You are mamma's brave boy. Okay. Good morning, Ankur. Yoo.. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Ma'am, this is the list of surgical kit which.. ...you've to buy from the surgical shop. We'll return whatever we don't use. If I give you the money, will you bring it? Nobody is here with us. I'm sorry, ma'am. Actually hospital staff isn't allowed to take money like this. And I think, it won't take too long. Because there isn't much crowd in the shop in the morning. Bye, Ankur. Thank you, ma'am. Bye. You'll be okay. I'll bring it within 5 minutes. By the time send to your Gina, Yap-yap. Hot Snap. WhatsApp, mom! WhatsApp! Okay, I got it. WhatsApp! Whaats. .App! Be careful. Careful. Be careful. Careful. Are you scared? No, mom. Doctor will take care of you. And Ajay uncle will take care of you. Naughty. - Of course I'll. And that's a promise. Bye, mom. Bye, son. See you, Champ. Good morning, Ankur. I hope your stomach is empty. Did you eat anything in the morning? No. Very good. Sister" take it. Sister. Actually when mom went downstairs, I was very hungry. So I ate some biscuits. Don't tell mom. Or else she'll be very angry. Excuse me, sir. The patient of appendicitis.. Sir. He's not NBM, sir. what"? Sir, the patient Ankur Arora ate some biscuits. So for some biscuits I can't postpone the operation. There is a queue for operation. But sir, operation is within an hour. I'll use Ryles tube. What's that for? Sir, to clear the patient's stomach before the operation. Exactly. It will be done. Go now. No, wife isn't coming. You can introduce me to anybody. Ofcourse I'm joking. Okay- Excuse me, ma'am. Yes. - Sir, this is standard disclaimer form. A routine operation formality. So ma'am has to sign here. Just sign here. We're ready, sir. Good. Is everything okay, sir? I had to do something. What was it? Damn my phone. Turn if off and keep it there. Sir. Scalpel please. Dr. Romesh.. ...what are you doing here? I thought you would be in the surgery. No, actually I'm only an intern here. Dr. Asthana is performing the operation. So nothing to worry about. He's the best. Thank you very much, everybody. Keep me posted. - Yeah. Doctor. Hello. Ah.. Ankur.. He's all right. He'll wake up in sometime. Thank you. - I got email for Geneva convention. I'll reply within 2 days. Son Ankur, show me your tongue. Good. Open your eyes. Open your eyes. This too.. Good boy. Oh my God. He's vomiting. He's asphyxiating. Oh God. Nurse suction machine. Quick.

About what? Sir, about Ankur Arora. What about Ankur Arora? Sir, everyone makes mistake. If we hide the mistake.. ...and if someone loses his life, it's called murder. Which mistake? Sir, you know I'm talking about Ankur. He died because of pneumothorax. Didn't you see the death certificate? He died because of lung failure. Do you know what you're saying? You're insulting a reputed doctor. Romesh, if I take this seriously. ...I'll drive you out of the hospital“. ...and you won't be able to do internship" ...in any hospital of the world. And I'm saying it very responsibly. Sir, you can stop me from becoming a doctor“ ...but at least tell that child's mother the truth once.. "That he died because of your carelessness. ...and not because of disease. Sir, please. Sir, confess this in front of his mother. Good night, sir. - Sir, she has the right to know this truth. Sir, I consider you my teacher. I worship you. - Sir, please. Don't lie. - What's the shame in admitting mistake? In this profession of saving lives.. ...we can't save life all the time. This is the truth. It's better you accept it. Romesh, it happens in medical profession. I'll happen. Sir, it has been happening.. Listen. You won't discuss this more. Do you understand? No, sir. I can't understand. You won't understand. I don't have time for this nonsense. Drive. Thank you. The guy was saying" Romesh. Hello. Hello. Sit. Do you know dad was asking about you not me again and again? I've ordered soup for you. I was just saying to Riya this is.. ...the last year of your internship. After that you've to decide that in this profession. ...who has to do what. That's it. I was concerned about that. I've told dad.. ...I wanted to do Cardiology. But dad says I should do Neurology. Riya, mark my word. Neurology is the future of medicine. And robotic technology has also become advanced a lot these days. And because of that income is very good too. Son Romesh, take soup. Romesh. Romesh. What is this, Riya? What the hell is the matter with you? You realize you insulted dad. He was telling you something, but you.. And Dr. Asthana must be playing badminton. We're making plans for our future. But there a mother is mourning her son's death. And she still don't know the reason of his death. Yes, she's mourning. Her son is dead. And I'm really sorry for that. I'm sorry we're not doing what we should. But you tell me, what do we do? Should we stop living? Should we mourn too? - Truth.. Do you know the meaning of truth? We just have to tell that mother the truth. Nothing else. The truth that you killed her son. You all have murdered Ankur Arora. This isn't true. Today after seeing you I'm wondering are you the one I knew.. ...or the one I don't know. What do you mean? You've become just like them. Like all of them. Like all of them? I've become like them? Yes, you're. The same people who make their palaces on other's graves. You're just like them. Romesh, please don't say that. I know I've lied to you, but what could I've done. I do not have any other choice. You didn't have choice yesterday, but today you do. Will you amend the mistake? You've to make this decision today.. ...right now. Are you out of your mind? The you think I'll go against Shekhavat. ...Dr. Asthana and entire medical fraternity" "that too for a child who is no more? Yes. I think so. Then think, if we do this we both will be ruined. Our dream, our future, our career, everything. I don't care if we get ruined. Romesh, please try to understand. Dad gave 80 Lakh capitation fee so that. ...I can become a successful doctor. ...I can become a successful doctor. I can't just throw it away because.. ...your conscience is pricking you. Try to understand. Such incidents happen in this world of life and death. No.. Are you with me or against me? Are you with me or against me? You've to take this decision today. Decision? Against whom? Against myself? Is that what you want? Romesh, I was also present in that OT. I'm the witness of that incident. I too have hidden a secret of that incident. I too have hidden a secret of that incident. And if this thing is exposed action can be taken against me too. I can go to court and even jail. Please try to understand. You don't see that knowingly or unknowingly.. ...you're going against me. You're fighting me. Maybe. Everyone's interest lies in this. I'm not responsible for that incident. I won't let my life get ruined. I never saw life getting ruined because of truth. Tell me, Riya.. "With me.. ...or against me? Romesh. With me or against me? Romesh, please. Riya. With me or against me? - Romesh, you're making a big mistake. Riya, answer me. With me or against me? Fine. Then listen to me. I'm against you. Fine. Then listen to me. I'm against you. Do you want to die? Have you gone mad? Lord Krishna answered Arjun's question about "Brahma". God even explains about devotions. ...and righteousness and duties. ...and righteousness and duties. In Sacred Bhagvad.. ...It's said that the ultimate truth is known as God or Brahma. The rest of the souls are referred as Brahma. Arjun asks about soul. Why are you standing outside? Come in. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come here at this time. I wanted to give this letter so I thought. What is in it? What is in it? When you get time, please read it. I'll take leave now. Thank you. Dear Nandita. I know Ankur will never come back. But as his mother.. ...you've the right to know.. ...what had happened with him. Because what you know.. ...Is not the truth. What the hospital told you, is not the truth. And you've the right to know the truth. He was lying on this table After operation was over.. Oh my God. He is vomiting. Oh God. He's aspirating. Nurse, suction machine. Quick. Yes, sir. Sir, oxygen saturation is dropping. Call Dr. Asthana quickly. In such a condition we don't understand anything.. "Except that something has gone wrong. I can not see anything. What is happening? He aspirated. What is happening? He aspirated. Why didn't anyone tell me that he had eaten before operation? Intubate him. No, doctor. There is lot of vomit Let me clean this first. Nurse quick. Oxygen saturation is down to 50. I can't see anything, there is food all over. You're not doing this for the first time. What's the problem? Stethoscope. Ventilator. What's the problem? Stethoscope. Ventilator. Saturation 45, sir. It's in to trachea, now doctor. Are you sure? Yes, I am. Reading, Dr. Riya.

Nandita, she's Kajori Sen. Our advocate. Mrs. Nandita Arora. We can definitely file a case against them. It may be tough. It may be tough. But if you want.. ...we can demand a big amount as compensation. What price can they pay for taking Ankur's life? 10 Crores, 20 Crores, 100 Crores. That won't bring my child back. So what do you want? Whatever happened with me.. ...maybe after fighting this case. ...It won't happen with someone else. Shekhawat. The owner. He's a big man of this city. Obviously, his connections will be very powerful. I hope you understand that. I do. I do. But for the fear of losing.. ...nobody stops fighting. And doctor Romesh.. ...do you know people of your medical.. ...fraternity will be against you? ...fraternity will be against you? They'll never forgive you. I'll file the case. We'll even fight it. But if you want, you can still go back. YOU can save your career. Career will be saved" ...how will I save my conscience? Good morning, child. Good morning, dad. Should I make a cup of tea? Yes. Hurry up. I've to go to office. - Okay. Yes. Hurry up. I've to go to office. - Okay. What are you eating? Corn ﬂakes. Very good. Hello? Sir, there is an urgent phone call for you. Bring tea. Hello? Sir, I'm speaking from Zee News. Mrs. Arora has filed a case of medical negligence against you. Mrs. Arora has filed a case of medical negligence against you. Do you want to say anything about it? Sir. Sir. What do you've to say about it? What do you want to say, sir? Dr. Riya Shrivastav. Sit. Tea, coffee? I'm sorry. I'm Rajeev Malani. Malani will fight the case for us.. "Against Ankur Arora's mother. "Against Ankur Arora's mother. On the day of Ankur Arora's operation.. "Besides Dr. Asthana four more were.. ...present in the operation theatre. You were one of them. After the incident in the operation theatre that day.. ...did you talk to anyone outside the operation theatre? ...did you talk to anyone outside the operation theatre? Dr. Riya, is there anything which you know and we don't? If there is something, please tell us. Or else Dr. Asthana's reputation.. ...my respect. ...In fact this hospital will become a big joke. And on top of that we'll have to pay a huge price. So, in case if there is anything... Riya, everyone knows about your relationship with Romesh. Riya, everyone knows about your relationship with Romesh. You stay together in live-in quarters. Many people objected but. ...I said, it's fine. There is love, so what? Speak up, Dr. Riya. Was it Dr. Romesh? Riya. What did you tell Dr. Romesh? Tell me. Speak up! I'm taking my stuffs. And this.. You keep this. I don't need it now. I've told them.. I couldn't lie. They wanted to know how others found out about the incident. I told them your name. You went to the lawyer. So why are you feeling bad about it? I'm doing what I should. You do what you've to. Romesh, I'm helpless. Believe me. Romesh, I'm helpless. Believe me. You're not helpless. I'm helpless. A lot more than you. Still, I've made one decision. I'll support the truth. I won't ﬂee. I'll support the truth. I won't ﬂee. Truth? What truth? The truth which is ruining our future.. "Because of the past. Riya, truth never ruins. You get ruined if you run away from the truth. Come in. Come in. My resignation. Dr. Romesh, you're a unique example of foolishness and bravery. Dr. Romesh, you're a unique example of foolishness and bravery. Maybe.. ...It's better than arrogant and careless. ...Dr. Asthana. Dr. Romesh, it's very easy to point finger at others. Dr. Romesh, it's very easy to point finger at others. Don't forget what happened in the operation theatre that day. Your hands froze while giving an injection. You're talking of carelessness. If not for me.. ...Laxmi Gagal would have died. ...Laxmi Gagal would have died. I remember, sir. You saved his life. And I also remember that after that day.. ...you didn't let me in operation theatre. It's correct. This should happen with you. You're right. I made a mistake and I was driven out. Now it's your turn. So you want I.. "Should sacrifice my reputation, this hospital's image.. ...for you. You don't have to do anything. I'll do the needful. You won't be able to do anything. I'll finish you. When my career didn't even start, how can you finish it? I've nothing to lose. And you've a lot. My Lord, this year on 9th June a tragic incident took place. An eight years old boy.. ...whose appendicitis operation was going on.. ...died. Because the hospital his mother chose" ...and trusted" ...were not capable to do even a simple operation. And if it was capable, then it was careless. No matter what the reason.. ...but that innocent boy had to pay with his life. Your Honour.. ...that day before the operation Dr. Asthana was told.. "That Ankur ate some biscuits an hour before the operation. In these situation, doctors use a special tube called Ryles Tube.. ...to remove the food from the stomach. But Your Honour, that day during the operation.. ...this tube was not used. Why? Because they forgot. The biscuits in Ankur's stomach turned to poison" ...and spread in his lungs. He went into coma. Cerebral hypoxia. And after 2 days.. he died. Your Honour, the prosecution will prove.. ...that hospital isn't just careless but culprit too. It will prove that what the doctors did here.. "Wasn't less than a first degree murder. It will prove.. ...In an attempt to hide their crime.. ...they're not just only guilty.. ...but culpable too. I didn't bring any chart, Your Honour. Nor I'll give a speech on this profession. Because I trust the doctors of Shekhawat General hospital.. "That during the operation that day.. ...Ankur Arora's lungs collapsed. In medical term it's called pneumothorax. In such a condition, the patient can't breathe. Vital organs don't get oxygen. Oxygen doesn't reach brains. And the patient goes in coma. That is exactly what happened to Ankur Arora that day. Abusing the doctors. ...defaming the hospitals. ...blackmailing them, is very easy. Because they value their respect and reputation. They become easy target. In fact, Your Honour.. ...this is a case of extortion and blackmail. And why should we yield to such blatant. ...blackmail and extortion? You did good by taking my advice to fight medical legal cases. You've made a good reputation by winning 4 cases. Romesh had to come to you. If you're smart, we can drag it for long. Shekhawat has very deep pockets. It's time to get my new office and your bungalow. So.. so what do I've to do now? Keep embarrassing the hospital in the court. And go easy on Dr. Asthana. Try to save him as long as you can. The case will be in the limbo.. ...the judge won't be able to give verdict. And I'll make sure that the confusion continues. I've to go now. Bye, my dear opposition lawyer. You're always in a hurry. I'm busy after all. Today we were going to talk about ourselves. What is there to talk? I'm married and we've no future. I know. Still I forget. Mr. Bhargav, what work do you do? I'm a handwriting expert. So tell me, has your experience.. ...been used earlier too in such cases. Many times. So many times that I don't even remember. Oh I see. Your Honour.. ...this is a blow-up of a page of.. ...a ledger with Ankur's details" "details before his operation. It's written that time before last meal, 9 hours. 9 hours. Mr. Bhargav.. ...tell the court what does this page tell you. For a common man this is just a number. Number 9. But for me, it's not number 9 but number 1. It has been made to 9. By making a curve from here. And not one, but two people have done it. With 2 different pens and at 2 different time. When we write something on the paper.. ...It forms a slight wrinkle.. ...which we can see only through the computer. Normally when a person writes.. ...It leaves wrinkles on the paper. But when he changes something. ...then he writes with a light hand.. ...very carefully. That's why such places have less wrinkles. In this paper too there are wrinkles everywhere.. "Expect near that 9.. ...where the wrinkles are less, as it was changed. Now what can I say to the court? Everything is clear. On the same paper.. ...at the same place two different hands can't write. So it's obvious.. "That someone changed this 1 into 9. Your Honour, we don't know who stole this ledger. We don't even know if Dr. Asthana did this or not. But someone has surely done it. And the funny part is that. "As per the time written in this ledger.. ...If Ankur ate something 9 hours before the operation.. ...then it must've been 1 O'clock in the night. And I don't need to be a master of logic.. ...to understand that no patient.. ...eats food at 1 O'clock in the night. Today you're talking only on phone. It means you won't come today. Not just at night, but even during the day we'll meet less.. "As long as this case goes on. If we're seen together, problem will arise for us. You're right. But I wanted to tell you something. It's urgent. What? Not on phone, we've to meet. Right now. Please. What happened? I'm pregnant. I thought there was some problem in the case. Don't worry, the case is fine. You wanted to meet for this only. We could have discussed this over the phone too. Yes, we could have. It's a small procedure. Abort ii. Today a special news will be shown on me. I'll be praised. I'm going to watch that. Call me when it's done. Kajori is proving again and again.. "That mistake wasn't of Dr. Asthana.. ...but because of hospital's carelessness She's trying to confuse it. Anyone can steal the ledger, anyone can write. This and that. Smart move. The court can't hold 'Anyone' guilty. As our lawyer it's her duty.. ...to prove Dr. Asthana guilty. But she's not doing anything like that. That's why I chased her. I saw him with Malani. Shocking. She's trying to trap us very smartly. Now we're trapped. Doesn't she understand. ...a boy has died. She's taking advantage of that too, for money. I want to meet her. I want to meet her right now. Kajori, open the door. We know you're inside. We want to talk to you. Kajori, open the damn door. We know you're inside. Break the door! Break the door! Just break the damn door! Yes. Ajay, call an ambulance. Quickly. Doctor says she's fine now. She took Mifepristone. She got allergic reaction. She had almost died. Mifepristone? Pill for abortion. She was pregnant. How are you feeling? I'm sorry.. Please forgive me.. Will get them sentenced" ...Will you forgive me? How it feels to lose a child.. ...now nobody knows better than you. This battle, no one can fight better than you, now. After 3 days Dr. Romesh Verma came to our house and told me.. ...how my son Ankur had died. Your witness please. Do you recognize this form? This is the form which you signed before your son's operation. Is this your sign? Do you sign any papers without reading it? Without knowing what's written in it? Yes? No. I don't do that. So please read point two of the operation" ...guidelines in this form. Patient should be NBM.. ...6 to 8 hours before the operation. NBM. I means Nothing By Mouth, Your Honour. It's clearly written on the form.. "That 6 to 8 hours before the operation.. ...patient is not allowed to eat anything. He has to stay empty stomach. And patient's mother had signed this form. The mother who is accusing the doctors of carelessness. ...but she's forgetting that she was the most careless. One hour before the operation, she let her son.. ...eat biscuits. Ask her, Your Honour.. ...what was she doing when the child was eating biscuits? Were you staring her? Watching TV? Or fixing appointment in beauty saloon? Your witness. Miss Arora.. ...what's myocardial infarction? Do you know? It's a heart attack. You would know Acute Coryza. No. No? It's common cold. Cephalalgia ? Have you heard this name? I don't know all that. Headache. Don't you know.. "As per my fellow lawyer.. ...you should have got all the information of medicine.. ...before admitting your son in that hospital. Objection, Your Honour. The prosecution is trying to lead the witness. Excuse me. Do you know what ED stands for? I thought you would know. Erectile dysfunction. Your Honour, you tell me.. ...did you know the meaning of NBM? Objection overruled. My Lord, whether common person knows about.. "These medical terms does not matter. What matters. ...the doctors treating them should know it. And especially a fantastic surgeon like Dr. Asthana. What the hell are you doing? What the hell I'm doing? Means? You've to drag this case.. ...not win it. Really? Did I've to do that? Sorry, I forgot. What? Yes, I forgot. Because I'm in a hurry. I've to watch TV at 10 PM. I've to watch accolades in news. ...only of mine.. ...not of others. Is this anger because of that jerk whom you had to abort? No.. ...It's because of the jerk with whom I had to sleep. You only know how to make deal.. Nothing else. I made you a lawyer. You'll stand against me. I'm still making a deal. The only difference is.. ...this time the deal is of truth" ...not of bodies. I'll crush you in the court. Go ahead. But remember, Rajeev Malani.. ...this time you'll be faced with not 2 women.. ...but 2 mothers. Remember that. As the women of the market say.. ...we won't touch you.. ...but strip your clothes. "There was neither light.." "..nor any ray of hope." "There was mist all around.." "..even the eyes were filled with tears." "Now the cloud has been cleared." "A voice is heard in the distant." "Life will be filled with light now." "Life will be filled with light now." Hello? Who is it? "Life will be filled with light now." Are you sure we'll find her here? Malani said.. ...they've sent her to Goa. She's here. 100 percent. There she's. Try to do it, my child. Yes, father. Go. Hi. My name is Kajori Sen. I'm a lawyer. You would know.. ...In Ankur Arora's case we've filed case.. "Against Dr. Asthana and the hospital. Roseena. Listen to me. Please. I don't know anything. And please leave me alone. Roseena. Listen to me just once. A child Ankur.. ...you've seen him yourself. You took care of him. Didn't he tell you he had eaten something? And you were the one.. ...who went to Dr. Asthana worried. Roseena, do you remember that child's face? Tell me. Do you remember that child's face? That face is no more, Roseena.. "He's dead. His mother performed his last rites. That face has been burnt to ashes. Your Honour.. ...prosecution would now like to call.. ...nurse Roseena to the witness box. Who? I'm sorry.. Objection, Your Honour. Roseena's name isn't on the witness list. She can not take the stand. Moreover, defense needs time to prepare cross examination. My Lord, she's a reluctant witness. ...and very important to the case. Your witness can take the stand. Defense will be given time to prepare the case. But the witness will have to be called again for the defense. Do you agree, Miss Sen? I agree, my Lord. Tell the court your name and profession. My name is Roseena D'costa. I'm a ward nurse.. ...In Shekhawat General hospital. But you've come from Goa. Is that right? Yes. I took a few days leave. Roseena, is it true that you took the leave the day.. ...Ankur went in coma? Yes. Is it also true that the same day Dr. Asthana.. ...gave you lots of money. Yes. This is also true. But there is one more truth. Dr. Asthana had sent you to your village.. "Because you were the first to tell him.. "That an hour before the operation.. ...Ankur had eaten some biscuits. Isn't that right? It's okay, Roseena. You don't have to fear. You can tell the truth in front of everyone. Didn't you tell this to Dr. Asthana? Roseena, look at me. Don't be scared. Tell the truth. Say it. No. It didn't happen. What are you saying, Rosina? I didn't know if the kid ate something or not. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know anything. Roseena, why are you lying? Roseena. Silence. Silence in the court. Your Honour, the witness has turned hostile. ...and should be excused. The court will reconvene on Monday morning at 9 O'clock. Roseena, you.. Get back. I didn't even touch.. ...but you were stripped. What will we do now? Nothing. We've no proof now against Asthana. As of now, we've lost this case. Do people die in accendipitis operation? Nobody dies in this operation. And we won't let you die. Are you sure? Very sure. Stop. Stop. Wait. Romesh. Come with me. Come. Where? Where? What happened? What is the matter'? I don't know myself. Do you see this? This is vomit. At the time of operation this thread was on Ankur's neck. When he vomited, it stuck on it. It's dried, but it's enough. Enough for what? For DNA fingerprinting. This vomit has Ankur's DNA. His vomit.. ...and traces of what he ate. But how will it be proved that vomit particles on this thread.. ...are of Ankur? A child's DNA is made with two sides. Half set matches mother's DNA and.. ...half set matches father's DNA. If we compare vomit particles with your DNA.. ...It will be 50% exact match. They'll prove that vomit particles. ...on this thread is of Ankur. What if they prove in court. ...that Ankur vomited before the operation.. ...and this particle was on the thread? If he vomited before the operation. ...his medical report would have Antiemetic.. ...a medicine to stop vomit. But it isn't there. He never vomited before the operation. And after the operation he was in coma. He could only have vomited during the operation. Romesh, you're a bloody genius. Your Honour, the prosecution requests 4 days recess. Only 4 days. And, why do you want this time? I want to prepare more for this case. The court gives 4 days time to prosecution. But this time is only for the betterment of case.. ...not to delay the case. I assure you, my Lord, nothing like that will happen. The court is adjourned for 4 days. This is not a good sign. She's up to something. Kajori didn't ask for time for no reason. She has surely got something. Meaning? What could she have got? I don't have a clue. But I don't want to look stupid in court. So? How will we know? He doesn't I don't want to look like a fool in front of the world. Because of this my company and I've.. ...become the laugh of the town. I don't want any more damage. Find out what it's. I understand. Now this game is going to get a little dirty. I suggest you both to keep away from this. I'll do whatever is to be done now. I've Kajori's number. We'll find Nandita's number from the record. And Romesh.. Is Romesh's number same, Riya? Did it change? No, sir. Go in the ward. Okay, sir. Yes. - I've Romesh's cell phone records. What is this Techno Med Lab? He has phoned many times in the past 2 days. Techno Med. It's the lab for DNA fingerprinting. Such labs are very few in our city. Any idea why he's calling there? In Ankur's case DNA fingerprinting.. Unless he has" ...found vomit samples. Maybe. What if this definitely happens. Then Malani, we're.. This is a perfect match. Check it. And let's all leave. It's time to close the lab. Yeah, sure sure.. Just give me one second. Thank you. A car is following us from the lab. Hurry UP- Step on it. Come on. Move. Quick. Get up. Come on, run. Run. They're going that way. God knows what happened. When I turned off the computer last night. "Everything was fine. This morning entire data and DNA samples were missing. So you don't have another copy of the report. And we can't even do that test again. No, man. I'm really sorry. All the samples are contaminated. But there must be some security at your place. Some CCTV or something. You know that's the thing. All the footage of CCTV cameras have been erased. I've no clue who came here. All I know is that as of now we've lost everything. - Okay. But this is criminal. We can complain to the police against it. We aren’t able to prove one case. ...how will we prove the other? She's right. But it's a crime to tamper with the proof. And last night they even attacked us. Yes, that's the law. But there is no proof that we had evidence. Meaning? It's all over. We can still make an effort. ...and only Romesh can do this. Talking to you can get me in trouble. Even hospital staff is here. I know. Just 2 minutes. What is it? You would know.. "That we had some evidence.. "With which they would have been in big trouble. But now we don't have that evidence. They were disappeared. Romesh, I don't want to fight. I've not come here to fight, Riya. In fact I've come to ask for something. Tomorrow it's your turn to testify in the court. Riya, tell the truth. You were in operation theatre that day. You saw and heard everything. You're the only witness to the crime. My last hope. Riya, I beg of you. Swear by God.. ...to tell the truth and nothing else. I do. I'll tell the truth. Dr. Riya.. ...you don't have to fear anyone here. We're with you. This year on the 9th of June, when Ankur was to be operated.. ...were you present in OT? Yes, I was. What happened with the boy after the operation? Dr. Riya.. ...what had happened with that boy? Tell us. After the operation.. Tell us, Dr. Riya. Tell us. After the operation.. ...Ankur's lungs collapsed. Your Honour.. ...the defense would like to move for a motion of dismissal. This case is maligning Shekhawat General hospital's image. It's keeping an important and busy surgeon.. ...like Dr. Asthana away from his job. This is nothing but a waste of public money. As prosecution. "Has no other witness. ...and it couldn't prove.. "That master Ankur Arora.. ...died because of negligence of doctors. So listening to the defense.. ...I dismiss this case.
